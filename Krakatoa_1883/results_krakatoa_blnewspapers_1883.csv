Death of the ""Stigmatica of Bois d'Haine.""— The death is announced of Louise Lateau, the stigmatica of Bois d'Haine. This singular being was born on the 30ih of January, 1850. She made her first communion at the age of eleven years, and began to earn her living as a seamstress at the age of fifteen. During the cholera visitation of 1866 she exhibited much devotion in attend- ing to the wants of the pest-stricken. In 1867 she was attacked by a lingering malady, and received the last sacrament. She was, however, cured (miraculously, said her friends), but only for a short time. Early in 186S she was said to have first experienced pain in the locality of the stigmata, and she again received the last sacra- ment. It is alleged, nevertheless, that she foretold her recovery, and on April 21st she appeared completely restored to health. The first outward indication of the stigmata is said to have taken place on the 24th of April, 1868, when a wound in the Bide was visible, which healed j the next day. On the lst of May blo.>d was reported to I have issued from tbe upper surfaces of her feet as well as from her side, and she then confided the matter to M. le Cure"". Seven days later the stigmata of the hands added themselves to the others, and M. le Cure* advised her to apply to the physician of Fayt, who attempted to cure her. In the course of 1868 several evidences of ecstacy are said to have occurred, and on September 25th, 1868, the crown of thorns first appeared. After this she ceased t±> deep. Her alleged complete abstinence from all nourishment began on March 30, 1871, and the wound on the shoulder appeared in the following April. Trie case attracted great at'ention at the hands of medical men, physiologists and psychologists, aud numerous pamphlets appeared on the subject. Difficulties were interposed in the way of a thorough sifting of the case, but it was pro- nouncsd a gross imposture by many who had an opportu- nity of investigating it.",English,Foreign and Colonial Intelligence.

The centre, under Captain coronat, occupied the fbrtlficatlons of Phukai, and established itself In the face of the enemy's' centre. 1« passed the night on this position, and rotbrned the next evening. The right, under Colonel Bichot, after skirting the rive*, under the protection of the gunboats, Stormed n fortified pagoda, and bombarded the enetnye hatterlne in concert with the fleet. But, iw view of Mte breaking of tho dikes, the Colonel Had tb embai* a portion of hhr men on the gunboats. I retain possession of the pagoda, which will be fortified. The gunboats have anchored alongside. After this Important engagement the enemy evacaated his position, and retreated on Sentay. ®a this offensive recondolesance we lost tw* officers andlO men killed and two officers and 47 men wbnnded. Hie enemy had 300 killed and about 1060 wounded."" The French Minister of Marine has also received the following despatch, dated Saigon, Aug. 25 -.—"" The transport Drac has arrived here with the news of the bombatdment of the forts and batteries situated at the mouth of the ITUO river and the occupation of the works by the French forces after a brilliant land attack. The operations were sarried out on the 18th, 19th, and 20th Itttt. Hie VipSre *nd Lynx have entered the Tlman Passage, the Anna- mites lost about 700 killed and a large number of ■vonnded. The French had several men slightly wounded. A truce has been granted by the Admiral. Commissioner llavniand, accompanied by M.Chatnpeau, left for Hu£ on the 22d inst. to treat with the Annamfte Court, where great alarm prevails."" A blockade has been declared, flut*, the capital of Annaftt, is situated on the banks of a river of the name name, 40 miles from the sea. At the month of the river stand the forts which hate l>een raptured by the French. ITu<j was built for the defence of the reigning family, under the direction Of French officers, and bnt for its large gates, surmounted by a riiinwe pavilion, might easily l>c mistaken for a fortified European town of the seventeenth century. Strictly speak- ing, Hitf is only a citadel within tho walls of which no private houses are found and no commerce fs carried on. Besides the Palace of the King, the Treasury, the maga- zines, and barracks, there are only the principal religious lemples in the citadel. The town that lies outside the fortress is In reality only a number of suburbs. Paris, Aug. 27.—The Temps states that MM. lfar- snand and de Champeaux were received by the King of Annam on the 23d inst. with every mark of tfce most perfect submission. The draft treaty submitted by the Plenipotentiaries stipulates for—(l j, the payment of a war indemnity ; (2), the occnpfrtion of the Ha£ forts by s French garrison till complete payment thereof; (3), the recall of the Annamite troops operating in the delta M the Red River, these troops to be placed at General Bouet's disposal to pursue the & nek Flags ; (4), the con- firmation of the French Prot' borate over all Artnam, already established in principle by the treaty of 1874'; but with complete guarantees, which were wafiting in that treaty. The troops that are to be sent to Cochin China, to take the place Of the gaVriifori which is guard- ing the forts on the river Hue, number abont TSflO lmn. France & Ma dag a scar.—Rekmseof Mr. Shaw. —A telegram has been received' in Pkris from Admiral Pierre at the Ministry of Marine announcing that the proceedings against Mr. Shaw, the missionary, have resulted in a decision that there was no ground for the charges against him The telepsam adds thftt Mr. Shaw has been set at liberty on the island of Edna ion. It is, sf course, physically impossible, that the release oi Mr. fihaw should have had any connection with the new temper of conciliation—if, indeed, it be new—on the fart of the French Ministry. It is due to the itufeptfi- ilent action of the French authorities on the spot, who, having found out that haßte or prejudfeo had lefd them to commit an injustice, have hail tho coorage atid good sense to confess their mistake instead Of attempting to excuse it. The result only shows how foolish it would have been for Englishmen to lash themselves into a fury which might have rendered it difficult for the French to «ake without lots of dignity such amends as they ean sow have no scruples about offering. France.—The Civil Tribunal of the Seine has given judgment in the proceedings respecting the Siemoirs of the Comte de Viel Castel. The Comte was well known in the salons of the Second Empire, and a man about town, who seems to have kept a diary of all the obscene stories and scandal of the time, lie had been early separated from his wifo, and late in life bad contracted a liaison with a Mine, de G«srard, to whom, according to her account, he gave the manuscripts, as his sole worldly possessions, at flie time of his death. Mine, fle Gerard has borne him two children, add it was to support them that he made the manuscripts over to her. Mme. de Odrard, after the Cerate's death, entered into negotiations v;ith the Viel Castel family, with a view to selling the papers to them, but terms couldnot be arranged, and ultimately Mme. de Gerard, with funds supplied by a Mme. Dnrand, had the book printed in Switzerland. It was brought out with a great deal of advertising, in Which the sole merit claimed for it was that it wae indecent. A Specimen catalogue of contents was sent far arid wide, which represented the book as treating of the am on re of the different notabilities, male and female, of the Im- perial Court. The family was shocked, ami the trustee sf the Comte's son (who has since died), on the ground that Mme. de Gerard had no right to the manuscript, had *n the copies found in France seized. The present action was brought by Mme. de Gerard to hate the seizure annulled. The plaintiff*! contended that it had not been effected with the necessary formalities, and that with respect to the alleged right Of the administrator to the property In the manuscripts, it was incumbent on him to prove his claim. In reply, counsel for the defendant produced a copv of a letter written by the Conite to hift son, recommending to his care his two illegitimate chil- dren. This letter never reached the son, and only an »xtract was communicated to him through the medium of a friend of his father. According to the friend, tbe pas- Mge omitted referred to the manuscript, and bequeathed it to the son. Counsel also produced ottier letters indica- tive of the Comte's intentions. The Court decided in favour of the defendant —that Is to say, it declares the administrator of the Cctotc de Viel Castel's property to hate been entitled to hate the memoirs seized. It should be added that tbe truth of some of the storivs in the book has been tehemently disputed. Death of the CfoMc <ic Chambord.—llertri, I)uc de Bordeaux, Comte de Chambord, ceased to breathe on Friday last. The agony of death set in on the previous afternoon. At noon the physicians bad announced to the family that dissolution was imminent. Thereupon all the members of the family assembled in the apartment adjoining the sick rOom. Here they spent some long and antlous hours. Towards midnfght, When the patient feD into an apparently tranquil sleep, most of the watchers retired to rest. At 4 o'clock in the morning they were again summoned. It Was thought that the last moment bad arrived, but the' struggle was not yet over. At about 8 o'clock spasms set in, and soon after- wurds death ensued. In the ehamber of death were the Countess, Gomt Bardi, tbe physician, Dr. Mayer, and tbe Father Confessor, Dr. Paul. In the next apartment were the other members of the household and the gentle- men who had oome from France. Tbe Comtesse de Ghaabord fainted when Dr. Mayer announced that MousiegnMr had passed away. At the last moment the Father Confessor grasped the left hand of the dying man and exclaimed ""Montez au Ciel, flls de St. Louis!"" Count Bardl, at the nearest relative, closed the eyes of Hie deceased. Immediately after death had enMKd tbe gentlemen ml aertante were admitted into the ehamber to kiss the hand of tbe Comte. The Comtetse Withdrew into her apartments and remained there all day. The fatal event was immediately announced to fee authorities at Vienna. About a hundred telegrams which had been prepared were sent with the tidings of death in aH direc- tions. Tbe Chamberlain of the Castle, M. de Pavilion, repaired to Vienna to confer with the Mai*ha! of tbe Imperial Household as to tbe interment, lit Giirite, where the body is to be interred, in tbe Vault of Cbaries X., great pomp will be observed on the occa- sion of the funeral. When the passing-bell Wat) tolled and the monnifnl intelligence became known, the inhabi- tants of Frohsdorf and the neighbouring villages tHronged to the castle to offer tip prayer* to the cbaprt for the ioul of the lost patron, to Whese mUnificenoe they owed to many benefits. Tbe Comte de Chatabord'a death had been too long foreseen to create any great sensation in Paris. His friends bad for weeks been prepared for the blow, and in some menmire resigned to its whilst his poli- tical adversaries—personal enemies he had none—bad bad ample rime to forecast the consequences. While, therefore, tributes of rtspevt to Ms mbfliory art universal —and ah nhpoptflW has rtever had a Ifeade* so far beyond tbe reach of calumny—people are more disposed to speculate on tbe future than to review the past.: That fnture, however, is at pwrailt veiled in much otakurity. au that is <*sat is that Legitimacy is at amend, tod that the indue Ftt# disappears fat eter. The Ganltr;*, indeed, raises the cry, "" ViVe Philippe VIL!"" But the (*auloi», though it happens at present to be Legitimist, is not a recognized mouthpiece of the party. The CMmettc 4e Framee, a mure authoritative organ, <ftes not go beyond tbe expression «t a bdpe that life &><Me de Fhris will uphold the Legitimist trwdKtolta; and cue Onion, the undoubted exponent of Legitimacy, reffairiS from saying a word on the new situation. The question it whether tbe Extreme Right will nrtly round a Prince who cannot help being the Hefcr of Louis Philippe as Ml as of Henri v. ; whether staunch Legitimfst* wni fight for a Prince who Is not a Legitimist, and Clericals for a Prince who Is not a Clerical. It is evident that these heated partisans are thrust into much the same position as tbe Bonapartists were by the death of the Prince Imperial. There is, it la true, the important difference that the Comte de Paris Is wholly exempt from the UUpepMatfcy which kttaehes to Prince Ifapoleou. But as a set-off to this, the Legitimists cannot, like the BoUapartists, ignore tbe immediate heir in favour of * reversioner. . The Count's father, the Dwe da Bern I, waa ansateinated as he was coming Osft «f the Opefa4wUSe on Sunday tbe 19th of Fe«Mtiary, IWO, by one Louvel. TiM mother was a Princess of the two Sidife*, aud be was born on Michaelmas-day to the same year. As if to complete the sacred promise of his origin, he was baptised in Water brought from the river Jordan by Mm eloquent and once famous GhAtoanhriaad. Daring tbe Arab few years of the child's life Hie prospects off <he MUUariAt seemed secure. In 1821 ftapoteon ®ed at St. fltfleftt ft Lodls XVIII., who died to 1824, had been su<#e6ded by such a one as himself, Bean V. might at least hate had a chance of trying his capacity for rale. But Cbavtaa X. upaet the j coach before k ted fairly settle* doWn Into the ruts. To avert the Sevotttton Of 1890, Or rSihUr tta djflfcuMSc conse- quences, he offered to abdicate tu favour of his grandson, then ten years ef age. But matters bad oone too far for say such compromise. lafajfette oaee more appeared upon the scene of his old aehtovetmmta, and Prince Polignac, the counsel** and eerveajxmlMot Of the Duke of Wellington, sated Ms neck, if net Ids head, by a timely flight.

The breach thus created between the oM and tfce now Monarchy was never perhaps more than nomlnaUy healed to tbe lifetime of the Cimti da Cbambord. The ""bouigepk king"" waa lnhii by tka adhtreuls of the old regime, whom he had dwiitad for the more lucrative Service of the m*MMK people.

Madame jested with the Prince de Jofnrille on their common infirmity of deafness. What a lot, to be sure, of castles in the air we all merrily built that even- ing."" The expectations indulged in by the Royalists were destined to disappointment. When the supreme moment came the Count refused to gite up his white flag, and the one great opportunity of Ids life was lost. The personal appearace of the deceased Pretender was prepossessing. His head was very well shaped. He was about the middle height and rather stout. His face was remarkably intelligent and denoted much energy of character. His eye was a clear blue-ahd his gaze very earnest; but what struck one particularly was his emphatic tone when speaking. The substance of the C6mte de Chambord'S Will was published on July 11 by a Boyalist' newspaper in Paris. According to it the Comte de Chambord formally commanded the obedience of the Royalists to the Comte de Paris as the heir to the throne of France, aild bequeathed to bim his library, his artistic collections, and all the papers interesting to the House of France.—The Republican journals comment in respectful terms upon the death of the Comte de Cham- bord, and declare that with him disappears the doctrine of Divine right. The RApublique Frattfdite says that under present circumstances the death of the Count is not a political event. The Jeurnnl des Debate considers that the event will not shake the Republican system of government, Which has been accepted l>y the immense majority of the country. The Monarchical journals believe tltat the sincere and complete unity of the Royalist party is now assured. —The will of the late Comte de Chambord bequeaths a legacy of considerable amount to the Pope. It is understood that the Countess will enter a convent. The Pope has sent a telegraphic despatch to Frohsdorf expressing condolence. Hie Princes of Orleans, with their suites, numbering 20 in all, arrived at Frohsdoif on Tuesday. All the visitors were asked to leave the mortuary chamber. Then, amid general silence, appeared at the open doorway the tell form of the Cointe de Paris, with his sOns, followed by the Due de Nemours, the Prince de Joinville, and the Due d'Alencon. The Comte de Paris stood still for a moment, glanced at the corpse, tlien passing his hand slowly over his brow walked to the praying stools. All knelt in deep emotion for some minutes. Then the Comte de Paris took his sons and went to the bedside, and knelt with them for some time. On rising he sprinkled the body with holy water. When all five hHd done the same they retired, walking backwards. Sooth Africa.—Durban, Aug. 23 (Times). —It is now certain that Cetewayo, in a defiant spirit, is gathering round him in the Inhanhla bush, eight miles beyond the Middle Drift of the Tugela, a constantly growing forcc of armed followers. The situation of Natal, should Cetewayo cross the border with his army, an a refugee or otherwise, is not likely to be a pleasant one. The Natal Caffres on this side of the drift are sftid to sympathise with Cetewayo. For the protection of the border 500 men of the 41st Regiment have been ordered to the lower Tugela. Two companies, ft is thought, may be despatched to Oreytown. It is suggested that Cetewayo may represent that these troops are advancing to support him. Most well informed persons here lrt'ld that the quickest and mofet effective solution of the existing difficulty would be for the Crown to declare its authority absolute as far as Urnvolosi, and to act accord- ingly. It is, of course, impossible to foresee what effect any sudden movement of Cetewayo might have. It is rumoured that more fighting ban occurred in North Zululand.

Afghanistan.—Calcutta, Aug. 20(Times). — A rumour was current in Peshawur last week that the Ameer had been assassinated by his nephew, Azig Khan, son of the Ameer Azitn Khan. I'p to last night, how- ever, the Government hail received no intelligence confirming this statement. The latest news received at the Foreign office is that the Arneer Was about to leave the camp Mama Kheyl for Cabul, after having given a cordial reception to Khan Bajom arid some Orukzai chiefs from Herat. A correspondent at Lahore tele- graphs this morning that it is reported the Ameer left Mama Kheyl for Cabul oh Thursday last, and that the rumours as to his assassination probably arose from the discovery of some plot laid, but not executed. Egypt.—Ahxitrulria, Aug. 25.—A decree of the Khedive is promulgated 10-day ordering the elections at Cairo to be held between the Ist and loth September; at Damietta, Sufez, Port Said, Rosetta, Ismailia, El Aricfa, and Alexandria between the 15th and 27tli September; and in the other mondiriehs as soon as the state of tho public health may permit.

A nti-Jewish Riots in Hungary.—Perth, Aug. 27.—Anti-Jewish riots commenced at Zala Egersseg, in Western Hungary, on the 23d inst., and continued with increasing violence on the 24th and 25th Inst, after the rioters had been reinforced by a number of peasants from the neighbourhood armed with muskets. The mili- tary were compelled to intervene, and a serious conflict ensued between them and the rioters, in which there were several killed and wounded on both sides. The destruction of property is described as terrible. Yester- day a number of peasants living at Zala Egersseg and in the neighbourhood are reported to have again attacked the military and the Jews. Twenty soldiers are said to have been killed and wouuded in the fighting. Anti- .Tewish disturbances have also occurred at Cszurgo Kesztliely and Gros Kamizsa. At the latter place, how- ever, the police, assisted by a detachment of Dragoons, succeeded in dispersing the mob.

With this they compare the estimated yield in bushels for 1888, as shown by their returns bat year: Wheat, 27 ; barley, 34} ; eats, 43 1-3; beans, 31$; peas, 28 2-3. Tbe estimates for 1883 are either about equal to or a Httle better than those for 1882, except in the case of wheat, Which, of course, M Mm promising than the crop of 1882 wan before MM wet harvest spoilt it. The splendid weather of the paet week has been all in favour of the crops, which should, therefore, come closely up to the estimates, as there has been a minimum of loss Where they have been secured.

Melsome, Beacon-hill, near Amesbury, in Wilts, commenced a singular match for slasting all day in broiling hot weather, during which the corn in tbe district around was being rapidly cut down. The contest, which was under the auspices of the Church of England Temperance Society, was the re- sult of a bet at a public meeting at Salisbury, and was between Mr. Terrell, a Wiltshire farmer, who challenged his opponent first, and Mr. Abbey, an Oxfordshire farmer and lecturer for the society. The issue was who would do the most work in the harvest field, the former drink- ing beer and tbe latter water only. Fifteen acres to each "" pitcher "" were allowed. The result was that beer won by above an acre. Mt. Terrell fro* the first held a very considerable lead, and at four o'clock the ground cleared by Him was 15a. 3r. 16p. and by Mr. Abbey 14a. 3r. AUeged Murder at Ipswich.—At Ipswich police-court on Monday Thcmiat Lyons Day, an ex- soldier from tbe Coldstream Guards, was committed for trial on charges of murdering Lilian Alice Lyons Meek and maliciously wounding William Woodgate. The deceased girl was tbe illegitimate child of the prisoner, but ber mother, having married Woodgate, she lived with him. The prisoner went to the house to see the child, and while nursing it cot its throat with a pocket knife, and on Woodgate interfering a scuffle ensued, in which he was wounded in the head so severely that be has been a fortnight in the hospital. Fresh evidence was given of the prisoner having been seen to sharpen his knife early on the day of the murder. It aIM came ont for the first time that the prisoner told a sergeant of police on the night of the muider that be bad got hie knife out to cut some hard tobacco, and that the child slipping off his knee became accidentally wounded, upon which Woodgate and his wife rushed at him The cross- examination was with a view to support this theory. The Dimttery of Dead Bodies at Bermotulsey. —Soon after Mr. Slade had taken his seat on the bench at the Southwark police-court On the 23d dMective- seTgeant Piekels, of tbe M division, informed hi# Worship that several persons had applied at the Beimoodsey police-station relative to 11 dead infants discovered at an undertaker's premises at 79, Long lane, Betmondsey. These persons appeared to be very poor, bat stated that they had paid the undertaker sums of money to the extent of se. each, on tbe promise that the bodies should be buried. Tbe children appeared to have been stillborn, and the police procured certificates of the death in each case. They a 8 seemed to be very indignant at the con- duct of the undertaker, and he was instructed to apply to his Worship as to whether some criminal proceedings could not be taken against the undertaker.—Mr. Slade asked If the coroner had instituted an inquiry relative to (he discovery of the bodies.—Sergeant Pickels replied that he understood an inquest would be held that day. The persons who applied to tbe police were in' court, mid they thought that the undertaker should be apprehends! for obtaining money from them by fraud and false pre- tences.—Mr. Slade observed that there was no fraud or false pretence, as the undertaker had made no Spec Hie contract as to the burial. The parties, however, might proceed in the County Court if they thought proper. He however thought that the sanitary authorities in tfte district should take the matter up.—Sergeant Piekels said that they had been applied to, but they declined to interfere at present.—Mr. Slade toM him that he could not interfere, as there was nothing before him.—Mr W. J. Payne held an inquiry at tbe coroner's eourt, High- street, Borough, upon the 11 bodies. The coroner decided to take two of the cases where the bodies bad already been identified. Ellen Jadraon, of 11, Vletoria- ptaee, CoHyer'a-rents, deposed to tbe birth of a stillborn child on August 3. Her husband arranged with Mr. Camden to buty it for 51. He said it was to be buried at Plaistow on the following Wednesday. He took it a Way in a small box. It was dressed at that time. The coroner's officer said tbe children bad all been stripped it the mortuary and thrown naked into one box. Tbe witness said she could not recognise any ehSd as hers, but She would know the nightdress again. Henry Smith, an undertaker, deposed to tbe last witness's baby being fetched away on Bank-holiday to the shop. Detective- sergeant Pickets deposed to finding the bodies in a sheH on the premises at 72, Long-lane. They were aD pinned up in cloths The jury returned a verdict of "" found dead."" The Murder near Croydon.—Mr. Morrison, the coroner for the Croydon division of Surrey, held an inquiry on the 23d, at New Thornton Heath, as to the death of Thomas Cole, aged 3 years and 8 months, who died from the effects of injuries received at the hands of his father, James Cole, who is in custody on the capital chaise. —The first witness caned was Richard Cole, who said he resided with his father (the accused) at 12, Pridham-road West, New Thornton Heath.. His father was a brickmaker and labourer. On the evening in question his father swore he would take his mother's Hfe. There was only some bread in the house, and his fkther threatened to take her life for keeping him without better food. About 8 o'clock his mother went home and hb father again threatened her. She after- wards got tip And dressed herself and went to the gate. While she was standing there the next door neighbour called her. When tfhe came back she said to her husband, ""1 can't sleep a minute for your slang."" It was a woman named Poster who called her. She said, "" Mm. Cole, I want to speak to you,"" and his mother went and spoke to her at the gate. All of a sudden His mother ran back to her own house, at the gate of which witness waa standing. When his mother opened the door Witness Aw his father holding the deceased up by the feet and k&ockfng his head on tbe floor. He then threw the child over his shoulder and dropped it on the floor. His mother seized his father by the collar just as he was about to take up his little sister. When his mother first rushed in she saw what her husband was about to do with Tommy, and screamed out "" Murder f and "" Oh! he's miing my child."" After that his mother seized the deceased and placed him on the bed.— Robert Gilbert, of 1, Pridham-road West, deposed that at he was going home on Sunday night the 19th he heard cries of ""Murder!"" He rushed to Cole's house and saw the accused dash tbe deceased against tbe wall of the front room. Witness pulled him out of the house and handed him over to a constable.—Harriett Harding, a married woman, living at 11, Pridham-road West, Mid that on the night in question she was standing at her door, when die heard Cole using filthy language towards Us wife. By the Coroner: Cole Was of tatompentte habits. When he was sober he would stay indoor* all the week and not search for work. She did not tiwnk the accused had had anything to drink on Sunday. She knew he had been in prison many times, and that be was a very desperate man. On one occasion his trite jumped out of a first-floor window to assaps from mm While he was chasing her with a knife.—Tbe jury returned a verdict of ""wilful murder"" against James Cole.

When he refused to do this the prisoners seized him, and tried to force him to drink some whiskey which h® belie Ted to have been poisoned. They could not do tM», however, and let him go, and then he gave informa- tion to the police as to what he knew. fie prisoners wore remanded without bail. The Assanxiiuitwn of Carey.—Messrs. Donald Carrie and Co.'s steamer Norham Castle arrived in Plymouth Sound on Sunday evening, and brings the con- tinuation of the evidence given before the Natal Magis- trates, when O'Donnell was charged with the murder of James Carey.—Mrs. Carey, who looked greatly distressed, said that she was the wife of the deceased James Carey, and came out in the Kinfanns Castle with her husband and seven children. She knew the prisoner O'Donnell, who came from London in the same mat. They used to speak to each other. O'Donnell landed in Cape Town with them. Her husband was the man who gave tho evidence in the Irish trials. She left London by herself, and her husband met her at Dartmouth. She had never seen O'Donnell before, and her husband and O'Donnell never talked together aliout the trials. They were steer- age passengers, and O'Donnell was second class. Worm- in gt on, a detective in Dublin, put the name "" Power "" on their boxes to avoid detection. She did not know who paid their passage money. Witness went on to say that she recollected Sunday, July 29, when she sawher husband running toward her, saying, "" Maggie, I am shot, and O'Donnell shot me."" Witness asked prisoner who shot him, and prisoner replied, "" I shot him; I was sent to do it."" Prisoner said, ""Your name is not Power; it is Carey."" Mrs. O'Donnell said to her husband, "" You are no Informer, O'Donnell."" Witness did not shake hands with O'Donnell. The prisoner was sitting on the seat. O'Donnell during the day had asked witness, previous to the murder, where her husband was, when she replied, ""On deck,"" when prisoner said, "" Call him down."" Witness did so, and the prisoner and deceased had some beer together. O'Donnell and her husband used to play dice on deck. The passage out took 21 days, and during that time O'Donnell and her husband were on the best OT terms. Prisoner bad told her that he had left the ship in Cape Town. O'Donnell was jealous of Carey, as ht had been too attentive to his wife on the Sunday after- noon. On Sunday she left deceased ami O'Donnell together. Deceased was standing and O'Donnell and hit wife were sitting on the settee together. She did not see the first shot Sred, but heard the third. She did not heai any strong words pass between them, and never heard hei husband threaten to shoot O'Donnell. Afterwards ah* fainted and was put into a cabin. Slie had no money and did not know what she would do. She supposed her hus- band would have looked for employment. Mrs. Carey, who had conducts 1 herself in a most becoming manner, and for whom evident sympathy was manifested in court, having signed her depositions, left the court.—llan-y tireenhough said he was a second-class passenger on board the Melrose for Natal. On the Sunday afternoon he was on deck between 1 and half-past and heard O'Donnell say, ""He shall not leave the ship."" He was not certain whether he said ""he "" or "" she."" The deceased and th« prisoner were on the be>t of terms.—Thomas Francis Carey, an intelligent-looking lad, said : I am 15 years of age. When my father was shot I was on the stairs lead- ing to the second-class saloon. I saw my father standing near one of the cabins on the starboard side. He was smiling and talking with O'Donnell. I saw Mr. O'Donneil draw a revolver from his inside pocket and tire one shoi at my father. The bullet struck him in the neck. I can- not say whether the prisoner stood up, but I saw him fir* a second shot. Just at this moment my mother ran out. My father ran into my mother's arms and cried out, "" Maggie, Maggie, I am shot. M'Donald has shot me.' We used to call O'Doiwell M'Donald ou board ship. Mj mother was holding my father when the third shot was fired. I was standing near the berths at the time. I took from my father's pocket a cheque for 1001. It was drawn on the South African Bank at Natal. I found the cheque this morning. I gave the cheque to my mother this morning. She knew nothing of it until then. My mothei can neither read nor write. Mr. Dallmont, chief detectivc in Dublin, gave the cheque to my father.—The prisonei pleaded not guilty, and said that be acted in self-defence, as Carey pulled a revolver out of his right hand pocket. —The prisoner was then taken from the dock, and after a short interview with his agent was conveyed to the North-end gaol.—O'Donnell arrived at Capetown on Sun- day morning in the Athenian. He was to leave on Tuesday evening. His friends are supplying him with everything he wants to eat and drink.—Mrs. Carey will leave with the other witnesses in a few days. She will, it is believed, give important evidence hitherto withheld from fear of the consequences to .her late husband.—At a meeting ol the Irish-Americans held at Nashville on Monday a large sum of money was collected for the defence of O'Donnell.",English,General News of the Week.
1883-08-31,0000325- The Citizen Gloucester,krakatoa,1,"TOPICS OF THE DAY. THE CITIZEN, FRIDAY, AUGUST 31, 1883 later telegrams received from Java show that the : recent volcanic errnption was terribly destructive. The native huts all along the beach have been washed away. Three towns, Anjer, Tuiringen, and Telok* betong, have been destroyed. Lighthouses in the Sunda Straits have disappeared. "" Where once the* mound of Kramatau stood, the sea now plays."" Anjer was completely washed away by the tidal wave which followed the eruption *of Krakatoa, and there has been great loss of life both here and among the Europeans and natives in North Bantam* The eruptions which have occurred in the Sund» straits have made navigation dangerous, for islands have disappeared and new ones arisen. The charts are therefore no longer to be relied upon, an& tbe Government have already commenced taking measures to obtain fresh soundings. In consequence of the eruptions in the Straits of Sunda, the Board of* Trade has requested the Foreign Office, Colonial Office, and India Office to telegraph to the Governors andY Consuls at different ports, to warn all vessels which may be approaching the Straits of Sunda. The total! extent of the disaster is not known and much alarm is naturally created throughout Holland, the greatest- anxiety being felt by those who have friends of' relations;iiving in the places affected. mm* Java is making good its right to contest with Japatt the grim title of the "" Lid of Hell."" The world which* lately stood aghast at the catastrophe in Isobia is now confronted with a far more terrible disaster in th© Straits of Sunda. It may yet be some weeks at least before a detailed description of this latest eruption reaches this country, so a Bhort history of previous eruptions may not be without interest. Java, with it* sixteen active and innumerable quiescent volcanoes is used to eruptions. In 1772, a volcano in the south-west of the island, threw out such an immense quantity ""of scorifo and ashes in a single night, that an; area having a radius of seven miles waff- covered with a layer 50 feet thick. Forty native villages were buried beneath it, and 3,000 persons are supposed to have perished in this one nighw A still>ore terribly destructive eruption was that on Mount [Galunggong, a few miles east of the former, which occurred in October, 1822. Without warning a dense mass arosejfrom the old volcano and spread with such rapidity that in a few moments the whole landscape was shrouded in the darkness of night A deluge of hot water and mnd shot up from the crater and poured down tbe mountain sides, sweeping away trees and beasts and human bodies in its seething mass- Nearly everything was destroyed for a radius of nearly twenty miles round. A second eruption four day* after completed the catastrophe. This was accompanied by an earthquake ; the summit of the mountain was broken down ; one side, covered with forest, became a semi-circular gulf ; new hills and valleys are said to have been formed, and rivers had their courses changed. As many as 114 villages were destroyed on this occasion, and 4,000 people killed. The news of the day from Berlin ia that Prince Bismarck and Count Kalnoky, the Foreign Minister* of Germany and Austria, have met at Salzburffv Accompanied by his wife and his eldest exm, Count Herbert, Prince Bismarck left Kissingen on Thursday, and arrived tbis ; afternoon at Salzburg, where he wa» joined, or two later, by Count Kalnoky. It waff at Salzburg, in 1865, a few weeks before the signature of the Convention of Gastein, that Herr yon Bismarck told the Bavarian Minister, Herr yon der Pfordten, that a war between Prussia and Austria was inevitable. ""One encounter, one decisive battle,"" he said, ""and Prussia will have itinher power todictate conditions."" Eighteen years have passed since then ; and now the repre* sentatives of Germany and Austria meet to confer or* the best means of preserving to Europe the blessing of peace. For it cannot be doubted, says the Timer correspondent, that this was the main object of their interview. It is admitted on all hands that the meeting of tbe two statesmen is a noteworthy political event- Monarchs may meet from motives of neighbourly courtesy and personal friendship; but when Foreign Ministers travel long distances to converse with each other, their reasons for doing so must be more' important and more interesting. Tbe warning given to France by the semi-official North German Gazette was emphasised yesterday by the same paper, which, as is well known, is generally accepted as the organ of Prince Bismarck. An articl* which appeared yesterday stated that the article against France which caused so mnch sensation in Europe was not intended as a menace, but as a warning* It professes itself to believe that the thanks of all friends of peace, even in France, are due to it for having given a timely warning of the consequence* which would result from the systematic agitation carried on in France with the object of stirring up hate* against Germany, and in favour of war with tbat country. Will France submit to the warning thu* imperatively given? Fuller accounts have now been received of the treaty of peace concluded between the French and Annamese* authorities at Hue, and it is evident that the French have not failed to secure the fruits of their recent success, such as it was. The net result of tbe arrangement is that France, by virtue of its stipula' tions, and so far as they may be held valid by Chinay becomes protector—in other words lord paramount; over all the territory claimed as his by the ruler at Annam. In order to secure the fruits of her military and diplomatic exertions, the Rupublio has acquired the right to hold permanently the forts at the mouth of the Hue River, together with posts which command the roads from Annam to Cochin-China. This latter province has been increased by the cession of "" Bit* Thuan"" on its northern border, and a line of telegraph is to be carried from Saigon to Hanoi, presumably overland. A resident, M. Champeanx, is to take up his quarters in Hue, and enjoy the right of private audienc* with the so-called Sovereign. Moreover, the* whole Customs administration—a most significant provision—falls into French hands, while the "" system v governing its conduct will be settled later by » special envoy. Thus the control over the kingdom i* complete. Nor is that specifically established, at least on paper, in the Tonquin province less absolute. There* the French may erect, on the Red River, possibly else- where, such fortifications as they please. In every town where it may be thought worth while, a Resident will be stationed, and it is remarkable that certain towns to the south-west—that is, over towards the Sian» frontier — are included by name. The official* nominated, it is laid down, may be accompanied by "" French forces to the extent judged necessary by th* French Government."" Tbe end and object with whid» France is credited in these transactions is the reduc- tion of Siam, so that the whole of what is called Indo- China—except British Burmah—may become a French possession. The application by the Chairman of the Jordan Valley Canal Company to her Majesty's Government for the loan of £8,000,000, to be a first charge on their undertaking, is perhaps one of the coolest propcsad* *Ver placed before any Government. The total **pital of the company, they say, will be 20,000,0C0 ■terling, and the company is willing to allow the *oan to be a first charge on the undertaking, and will Provide a sinking fund for its redemption within a Period of fifty years. If tbat is unobtainable they will J* much obliged if the Government will guarantee interest at 3£ per cent, upon the whole or any portion °* the company's capital of £20,000,000. At tbe present problematical in tbe highest degree whether *°ere is any possibility of opening a navigable highway the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan Valley. *be proposal is for communicating canals, one com- mencing at Haifa, in the Bay of Acre, to connect the Mediterranean with the northern end of the Jordan •alley, and the other to run along the Waddy-Arabah, *° loin the Dead Sea with tbe Gulf of Akabah. 111- **tured people oppose this brilliant scheme by the *cry ugliest and hardest facts. Sir Charles W. Wilson, authority none can dispute, vouches for the fact 'bat the watershed in the "" Valley of Akaba,"" between *be Dead and the Red Sea, through which the canal is *° is 781 feet above the level of tbe latter, and 2,040 feet above that of the former. And a writer in c September number of Blackwood's Magazine the cost of the two canals, from the Gulf of to the Jordan Valley, and from the Dead Sea to *be South, at £222,705,000 or 2£ millions sterling per *tile 1 The Sultan of Turkey too, is understood *° bave expressed an opinion tbat he is by 110 means in favour of the Jordan valley canal. That Prime Minister does not look kindly upon the Proposal is manifest from his reply to the Executive when he acquainted tbat body that he had •eferred the question to the Foreign Secretary, to whose department Mr. Gladstone considered the subject Matter seemed to belong. The idea of creating a Waterway from Acre Bay, on tbe Mediterranean, to •*-kabah, on tbe Red Sea, taking advantage of tbe deep depressions through which the Jordan flows, is, we '""ay remark, no new suggestion. Twenty or more 'ears ago it was discussed, and at various times since, the feasibility of this great ditch has been debated in * bap-hazard kind of way. Its revival as a British *°b*me—for on its initiation it was, like the Suez G*nal, a French notion —is of course due to the diffi- culties which have arisen in connection with M. de **88eps' great work, and the exclusive right which he *Uims of cutting waterways through the isthmus.",English,TOPICS OF THE DAY.

A tidal wave has swept away tho European quarter of Anjer and the Chinese camp at Merak. Telegraphic communication is now inter- rupted between Bantam and this city. Batavia was in darkness for several hours yesterday, owing to the thick rain of ashes proceeding from the volcano. Tho lower quarters of the city have been swamped by a tidal wave, but the godowns and entrepots are not damaged.",English,A GREAT TIDAL WAVE.
1883-08-31,0000321- Nottingham Evening Post,krakatoa,1,"THE EVENING POST. Friday, August 31, 1883. It is understood that the War Office has now tinder consideration a proposal for extending and Reorganising the defences of the port of Liverpool, »nd that an important decision on the subjsct may be come to at au early date. So many fictions (writes a correspondent) have found publication in connection with Sir Stafford Northcote's health, that it may be as well to men- tion his almost complete recovery from tho ex- haustion consequent upon his prolonged parlia- mentary labours. "" A friend of the family,"" the writer add 3, "" assures me that the distinguished -statesman is iv far better health than he was a couple of months back."" Nottingham horticulturists are not likely to be behindhand in preparing for the International Horticultural Exhibition, which, it appears, is to take place in London next year. The subject of Such an exhibition was much discussed so long ago as 1878 and 1879, but nothing has yet been done to carry out the suggestion. It is clear, with the help ot our colonial dependencies, that the whole of the space now occupied by the Fisheries Exhibition might be quite filled, and be made at least as in- teresting and instructive to the general public as the present exhibition. The whole of the build- ings might remain almost as they are, eacli country refilling the space with objectß suitable, «nd in keeping with the next year's show, which, we should say, if at all carefully managed, can scarcely fail of success. At Genoa the importance of the proper nursing and treatment of infants is so highly regarded that the municipal authorities have determined to gratis to all those who present themselves at the offices to register the birth of a child a small tract or pamphlet containing brief directions for ""the healthy rearing of the now-born. The idea is a good one, and it is to be hoped the Genoese population may be improved by its means, but we can scarcely recommend it for adoption in this country. As regards pamphlets and tracts Englishmen are divided into two classes, those who write and those who destroy them, It is a I painful fact that people can with difficulty be got to read what is good for them, and if they know it is presented from a philanthropic motive their ""prejudice is the more confirmed. Let us hope tho * Oenoese aro more sensible in this respect. Householders will not be very pleased to learn that their implacable foes, the fraternity of thieves, have discovered a new method, and a very cruel one, for the pursuit of their nefarious ends. It is Ho less than the setting of houses on fire in order to utilise the confusion consequent thereon to rob either the houses so ignited, or, more probably, others in the neighbourhood. Early yesterday morning two houses in the neigh- bourhood of Prince's Park, Liverpool, were found to be on fire, and it was also evident that the fire was not the result of accident, In each case a window had been broken and burning matches •scattered inside the room, igniting curtains and other articles. Some days ago it appears there was a very similar occurrence in Birkenhead ; but in that case it wa3 thought that some personal malice might explain the outrage. In the Prince's Park affair no such supposition is feasible, and the conclusion come to is that the fires were caused by evil disposed persons, to divert the attention of the police from their own proceedings. Fortu- nately, the amount of damage sustained was not very great, and the local authorities will now be on guard against the commission of similar offences. As, however, there is no reason to suppose that the new crime will be confined to Liverpool, a hint of warning to the public and the police in our own district may not be without use. Some idea may be formed of the awful nature of the catastrophe which has visited the north- west coast of Java from the later details now to hand. The district around the volcano of Krakatoa has been converted into an ashy desert, in which cattle seek for pasturage in vain, and the inhabitants find all means of support suddenly denied them. So terrible has been the power of the volcanic forces that the mountain itself has been destroyed, only, however, to give origin to sixteen new volcanoes. Another crater we read of as having been split into five parts, and on the whole the work of destruction could scarcely be more complete. As to the loss of life this is on a scale equal to the other proportions of the catas- trophe. The thousand bodies already recovered from the ruins andjnterred can, it is to b'j feared, only be regarded as'"" the first fruits of the huge harvest of death reaped by tho demoniac energy of the great volcano. Englishmen have little interest in Java or its people, but a disaster of this magnitude will not fail to appeal tn our national sympathy, and possibly to our generosity as well. Concerning the scientific aspect of the catastrophe, it is, perhaps, too early to speak definitely, but ite occurrence so soon after the Ischia earthquake lends considerable support to the theory that these subterranean forces are m some way connected, and it is also by no means impossible that the destructive tidal wave which has just visited the Atlantic coast of North America may owe its origin to another develop- ment of the same hidden agency, The latest telegrams from the East show that the Treaty which has been concluded between France and Annam i 3 of a somewhat sweeping character. The former Power practically assumes a suzerainty over the Annamese kingdom, and this, too, in distinct defiance as it were of the submis- sion claimed by China of the King of Annam. Such arrangements are not always of a happy kind, as witness the British suzerainty over the Trans- vaal, and it will remain to be seen whether China will without a struggle surrender a right upon which she evidently set 3 considerable value. The gain of France is, however, of by no means a merely sentimental nature. To securo the fruits of her military and diplomatic exertions, the Republic has acquired the right to hold permanently the forts at the mouth of the Hue River, together with posts which command the roads from Annam to Cochin-China. This latter province has been increased by the cession of Bin Thuan on its northern border, and a line of telegraph is to bo carried from Saigon to Hanoi, presumably overland. A Resident, M. Champeaux, is to take up his quarters in Hue, and enjoy tho right of private audience with the nominal Sovereign. Moreover, it is most significant that the whole Customs administration falls into French hands, while the ""system"" governing its conduct will be settled later by a special envoy. In short, the control of France over this Eastern kingdom appears to be of an absolute nature, and apparently the same provisions are to apply to the province of Tonquin. The treaty gives the French authorities a right to erect fortifications on the Red River, at their own discretion, and probably elsewhere in the province also. All suspicious movements of the population will be most jealously watched, for which purpose a Resident is to be stationed in each of the principal towns, including certain places towards the Siamese frontier, which are specially mentioned, an indication of the idea in the minds of those who framed the treaty that this frontier might, in future, serve as a useful base for further conquests for the glory and advantage of France. Indeed it is impossible to accept any other view of the case when we remember that the persons nominated to these offices are to be accompanied by "" French forces to the extent judged necessary by the French Government."" In short, it would seem that the Republican negotiators have acquired, potentially, all the territory between the sea and the Siamese and Chinese frontiers, : and such a movement can only be interpreted as signifying a desire on the part of the French for the possession of a second India. After the con- quest of the Siamese Empire the whole peninsula ' of Further India, with tho exception of British Burmah, would practically be at the mercy of the French, and the new ambition of our neigh- ' bours would be gratified, although at a cost which they hardly at present reckon on. They have not yet subdued what they are } pleased to term the "" rebellion"" in Ton- L quin, but their animosity is so strong against the natives who resist their will in this quarter that one of the chief Paris newspapers actually recommends the treating of these patriots as 4 ""malefactors."" As we have before remarked, [ however, China will almost certainly have to be reckoned with it if the French ""tideof conquest "" is to proceed. The Chinese Court seems to have established very good terms with Germany, and in the immediate neighbourhood of her ' own territory China could with ease pour down on the French such a mass of well-armed ' and fairly-trained men as would be very calculated to give pause to their small expedition. ' Some of the French newspapers seem to observe ' the danger threatening in this quarter. ""Wo have . succeeded in Hue',"" remarks the Parlement, ""but F . we must not think of recommencing the Chinese 1 expeditions of 1860. Neither do we think our Government will be reduced to try it. If, as 5 seems not doubtful, China has at least indirectly encouraged the Black Flags, it is owing to our 1 weakness and hesitation. China fancied the ' least check would upset our frail colonial edifice. * Now that she knows better, there will be 1 no alternative but frank friendship or open war. France greatly prefers the first solution, and the interests of China should dictate to her an * analogous policy."" This is sound policy, although I couched in rather patronising terms, and, if the 5 French Government bo wise, it will rest content k with its present victory without too eagerly rush- l ing into new and more dubious undertakings.",English,

Opposite this. In Sunda Strait, lies tha volcanic island of Krakatoa, the eruption of which has lad to what is feared may bo a swooping disast r. Serang and Batavia, as announced, wera in darkness on the 27th, while the ashes and stones discharged from the volcano had travelled as far as Cheribon, some 253 miles distant, This was followed by a ""tidal wave"" which choked up the rivers, oversowed tho land, and swept away the European quarter at Anjer and tho Chinese camp at Merak. Java, with its 16 activc, and innumerable quiescent volcanoes, is mad to eruptions, some of which have even boen mora destructive than tho Ischia earthquake. This volcano of Krakatoa has been in a state of unusual activity for some weeks, Somo of tha Java volcanoes rise to ■ height of 12,090: t In 17 T2 the volcano of Papandayang, in tho south-west part of the Island, threw out such an immense quantity of scori >- and ashes In a single night that an area of seven miles was covered with a layer -0 feet thick. Eorty native villages were buried and OJO persons are supposed to have perished in this one night. Still more terrible destructive was.the eruption of Mount Galunggong, a few miles east of the former, on October 8, 18-li. About mid-day, a dark, dense mass rose from tha old volcano and spread itself out with such ap- palling rapidity that in a few moments the whole landscape was shrouded in the darkness oi night Bright flashes occasionally pierced the darkness, a deluge of hot water and mud shot up from the crater and poured down tha mountain sides, sweeping away trees and beasts and human' bodies. Nearly everything was destroyed for 20 miles round. A second eruption four days after completed the catastrophe. This was accom- panied iby an earthquake; the summit of the mountain was broken down; and new bills and valleys were formed, and rivers had their courses changed. As many as 114 villages wero destroyed, and 4000 people killed. In it is estimated that Mount Gu .tuo flung forth ashes and Gand to the extent of 2j,000,000 tons; in ISG7 an earthquake caused the death of 1000 people in the town of Jokgokarta alone ; in 1572 one of the most active volcanoes, Merapi, brought death to many of the dwellers around. Earth n'.aUes destructive to life are of frequent occurrcnco; tha most celebrated is that of January 5, IG'j9, when 203 shocks wero felt, and many houses in Batavia destroyed. Mud volca- noes, gas fountains, and hot springs are common ovar the islnnd. There seems little doubt that the so-called "" tidal wave "" which has swept over ; the coast of Java is intimately connected with the volcanic activity of the mountain in the bay. : This kind of wava is of ft totally different I character and origin from the last destructive wave that visited that quarter of the world, the 1 cyclone wave of Bengal, on October 31, 1870, which, sweeping up the Bay of Bengal to the low-lying oountry around the mouth of the i Oanges, covered an area of TOOO square miles, and in ft few minutes destroyed 213,000 lives. The last great ""tidal wave"" was on June 10, 1H77, when an enormous wava spread itself from tho Sandwich Islands to the Peruvian coast, and even made itself felt in Australia and New '/ ea- land. This wave was certainly coincident with ft i violent eruption of Mount Kilanoa, in Hawaii, and frequent earthquake shooks and ernp- ! tions on the west coast of South America, I Both in the Sandwich Islands and in Peru I the wave repeatedly charged over the land, carrying ships far inland and destroying every- I thing that cpme In its way. Curiously enough, i on the same date a very marked shook of earth- i quake was felt at Comrio, Perthshire, the most ' frequent centre of seismic activity in this country.

The latest telegraphic despatch received by the Dutch Government from tbe scene of the recent volcanic convulsion states tbat no intelligence had arrived at Batavia from tbe Dutch Resident in tbe South Sumatran province of Lampong. It is concluded that Telokbetong has been entirely destroyed. An expedition has left Batavia for Dampong to ascertain the effects of the disaster in that district. The Dutch Cmtroleur a.tK&timbong, which forms the extreme south-eastern point of Lampong, baa been saved, along with all the members of his family. The fact is important as indicating tbat the destruction m that quarter has not been so overwhelming as bad hitherto been apprehended ; that, at any rate, it is not absolute. ■ . , Further particulars bave been received from the Straits showing that at Merak, which waa situated only three milea from Krakatoa, the destruction is complete. Not a vestige of the place now remains. A fort was built there many years ago, and in 1877 extensive quarries were opened in the neighbourhood in order to supply stone for the construction of new piers and doctts in the harbour of Batavia. 'Jbere were other extensive industries carried on at the spot, including railway and ironworks, and there was also a large dynamite store connected witb the quarries The latter were three hundred feet deep, and had within the past five or six years supplied not less than a million and a half tons of rock. Altogether there were some thousands of labourers employed at Merak. They were mostly natives, tbe number of the Europeans having dropped off since the completion of tbe Batavia harbour works. The dwelling-houses, shopp, and business offices stood on an elevated site, about one hundred and fifty feet above tbe level of tbe Bea. Of tbe population of Merak it has now been ascer- tained that, with the exception of one European book- keeper and two natives, every soul has been drowned. There ia not a building left standing, and every bit of property, including all the stores and raw materials, has been completely swept away. In this single spot the loss is estimated at a hundred thousand pounds. With regard to the tidal wave, intelligence has been received from Taudjong Priok, stating that at that place, fifty-eight miles distant from Krakatoa, a sea seven and a half feet higher than the ordinary highest level suddenly rushed in and overwhelmed tbe place. Immediately afterwards it as suddenly sank ten and a half feet below the high-water mark, the effect being most destructive.",English,THE VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS.
1883-09-05,0000327- The Derby Daily Telegraph,krakatoa,1,"THE JAVA ERUPTIONS. The Hague, Tuesday. The Governor-General of the Dutch Indies telegraphed yesterday evening that the extent of the calamity caused by the eruption at Krakatoa is net yet to be estimated, lelok Betong is un- approachable, bnt is probably entirely devastated. From the Resident at the Lampong district no report has been received. An expedition has been sent thither to gain information. The navigation through the Sti alts of Sunda is very dangerous.

The commotion of the sea was enormous. At Tandjong Priok, 55 miles from Merak, the water rose to two metres and a fourth above the Batavia tide, and feH more than three metres under that tide. The quarries were in rocks 300 ft. high, the house and office of the engineer being built on a hill 150 ft. beyond the sea.

1883-09-06,0000221- The Bath Chronicle,krakatoa,1,"THE EARTHQUAKE IN JAVA. 100,000 Lives Lost. Little additional news has been received respecting the terrihle natural convulsion in Java. It is not yet possible to collect the data on which a trustworthy calculation oan be founded, but in any case the loss of life is expected by competent judges to turnout vastly larger than any estimate hitherto published. In North Bantam there were till recently half a million Javanese inhabitants, but a considerable migration has taken place, owing to the diminishing productivity of the soil of late years. Nevertheless, it is considered probable that from eighty to one hundred thousand natives bave perished in this district, as the population of Anjer and Tjiringen alone was nearly sixty thousand. From telegrams despatched from Yew York it appears that the disturbances began on the island of Krakatoa on Saturday, August 25th, when distinct rumblings were audible at Suraperta and Batavia. Little alarm was felt at first, but within a few hours showers of stones began to fall, and all through the night showers of red hot stones and ashes fell. The temperature of tbe sea rose nearly twenty degrees and the waters were boiling and hissing violently. By noon Maha Meiu, the largest of the volcanoes, was belching forth flames at an alarming rate. This eruption soon spread to Gunung Guntur and other mountains until more than, a third of the forty- five craters of Java were either in active eruption or threatening it. Just before dusk the crater of Gunung Guntur began to emit enormous streams of white and sul phurous mud and lava, rapidly succeeded by explosions followed by tremendous showers of cinders and enormous fragments of rock. With these terrible eruptions came sympathetic demonstrations from the sea and at one time more than fifteen huge waterspouts were seen. Men, women and children rushed in terror from their tottering dwelling places, filling the air with shrieks of horror. Hundreds were unable to get out before tbe houses fell and were buried beneath great masses of rocks and mud. On Monday it was seen that a large tract of land— oovering about 50 square miles—had disappeared. Sumatra as well as Java appears to have been visited by the earthquake. A ship has been sent from Batavia to Lampong in Sumatra, where the situation of things is most horrible. For a distance exceeding five miles every- thing had been destroyed, aud many thousands of lives have been lost. _ The native population are furious against the Dutch, believing that the calamity is a punishment from Heaven for the war in Acheen ; and it is found to be dangerous for any European to approach the people. This statement, however, requires confirmation, as the Lampongs are naturally a very timid race ; and probably the present excitement is a consequence of the priests working upon the fanaticism of their followers. The lighthouse at Lampong has not yet been relighted. A telegram received by the Nederland Steamship Co., dated Batavia. August 31st, says that the Straits Govern- ment have offered $25,000, and the Java Government 5,000 guilders towards the relief oi the distress caused by the earthquake. A communication from the Secretary of the Admiralty states that H.M.S. ""Champion,"" H.M.S. ""Magpie,"" and H.M.S.

The Comptroller and Assistant Resident at Tjiringen, together with a lieutenant employed in the Topographic Service, were among those who perished by the eruption. Search is still being made for five Europeans known to have been at Anjer at the time of the eruption. Two vessels of the American squadron in Asiatic waters have been ordered to proceed to the Straits of Sunda to examine the state of affairs, (Daily Newt Telegram. ) New York, Sept. 2. The disturbances began on the island of Krakatoa on Saturday, August 2""jth, when deep rumblings were distinctly audible at Suraperta and Bntavia. Little ! alarm was felt at first, but within a few hours showers ef stones began to fall, and all through the ni?bt showers of red-hot stones and ashes fell. By morn- ing all communications with Anjer on the Strait i of Sunda were destroyed, bridges being wrecked and roads rendered impassable. Tiie disturbances had extended beneath the waters of the Strait, and they were boiling and hissing violently, while great waves dashed on Java's shores. The temperature of the sea rose nearly 20 degrees. Far away at Madura, more than 300 miles distant, furious waves were lashed into mountains of foam as they came rolling in. The rumblings gradually became more and more dis- tinct, and by noon of the same day Maha Meru, the Im-gest of ths volcanoes, was belching forth flames at an alarming rate. This eruption soon spread to Gunung (luntur, and many other minor mountains, until more tiian a third of the 45 craters ot Java were either in active eruption or seriously threatening it. Just before dusk a great luminous cloud formed over Gunung Guntur. and the crater of that volcano began to emit euorrnous streams of white and sulphurous mud and lava, which were rapidly succeeded by explosions, followed by tremendous showers of cinders and enor- mous fragments of rock, which were hurled high into the air and scattered in all directions, carrying death and destruction with them. With these terrible erup- ' tions came sympathetic demonstrations from tiie sea. Overhanging clouds were so surcharged with electricity that at one time more than fifteen huge waterspouts were i een. Men. women, and children rushed in terror from their tottering dwelling-places, filling the air with shrieks of horror. Hundreds were unable to get out before the houses fell, and weie buried beneath great masses of rocks and mud. On Sunday evening, the shocks and eruptions increased in violence, and ihe island seemed threatened with submersion. At the s une time enormous waves began to dash with greater force upon the shores, coming in some p'.aces far up into the interior ; and great chasms opened in thi earth, threatening to engulf the people and buildings. . About midnight the most frightful scene of all took place. Suddenly an enorm- ous luminous cloud, similar to that over Gun- ung Guntur, but much greater in extent, formed over the Kandang range of mountains which skirt the south-east coast of the island. This cloud gradually increased in size until it formed a canopy lurid red cad whitish gray over a wide extent of territory. During this time the eruptions increased, and streams of lava poured incessantly down the sides of the mountains into the valleys, sweeping everything before them. About two o'cioc on Monday morning, this great cloud suddenly broke into small sections and vanished, and when daylight came it was seen that an enormous tract of land had disappeared, extending from Point Capucin, on the south, to Negery Passoerang, on the north and west, to the lowest point, covering about 50 square miles. Here were situated the villages of Negery and Negerj Babawang. : None of the inhabitants of these places escaped death. This section of the island was less densely populated than the other portions, and the loss of life was com- paratively small, although it must have aggregated 15,000. The entire Kandang range of mountains, ex- tending along the coast in a semicircle for about 6.> miles, bad gone out of sight. The waters of Welcome Bay, in the Sunda Straits, and Pepper-Bay on the east, and tbe Indian Ocean on the south, had rushed in and formed a sea of turbulent waters. (>n Monday night, tbe volcano of Papandayang was in an active state of paroxysmal eruption, which Was accompanied by detonations which are said to have been heard for many miles away. In Sumatra three distinct j columns of flame were seen to rise from a mountain to I a vast height, and its whole surface was soon covered with fiery lava streams which spread to great dis- j tancss on ail sides. Stones fell for miles around, and i black fragmentary mattsr carried into the air j caused total darkness. A whirlwind accompanied i this eruption, by which house-roofs, trees, | men, and horses were carried into the air. The quantity of ashes ejected was such as to cover the ground and the roots of the houses at Denamo to the depth of several inches. Suddenly the scene changed. The mountain was split into seven parts without a moments warning, and where Papan- daying had stood alone were now seven distinct peaks, in the opening seams of which could be seen great balls of molten matter. From the fissures poured forth clouds cf steam and black lava, which flowing in steady streams, ran slowly down the mountain sides, i forming beds 200 or 300 feet in extent. One of the most singular incidents was the sudden rising on the forenoon of Tuesday of 14 new volcanic mountains in the Straits of Svmda, forming a complete chain in almost a straight line betweet Point St. Nicholas on the Java coast, and Hoga Point on the coast of Sumatra, almost on the tops of what had been Merak and Middle Islands, which Stmk into the sea on the previous day. At the entrance to Batavia was a large group of houses extending along the shore, aud occupied by Chinamen. This portion of j the city was entirely destroyed, and of 25,000 Chinese who lived on tiie swampy plains, it is hardly probable tbat more than 5,000 managed to save their lives. They stuck to their homes till the waves.came and washed them away, fearing torrents of flame and lava more than torrents of water. Of the 3,500 Europeans and 'Ymericans in Batavia, |00 perished at Anjer. The European and American j quarter was first overwhelmed by rocks, mud, and lava j from the crater, and then the waters came up and swallowed the ruins, leaving nothing to mark the site, and causing the loss of about 200 ItVes of the inhabit- ants and those who sought refuge there. Bantam was entirely' covered by water, and .1,200 to 1,500 are be- lieved to have been drowned. The island of Serang j was completely inundated, and not a soul sur- Tired. At Cheribon there was no great flood of water, but the loss of life and property by falling looks and lava must have been considerable, j BirtinzoDg suffered seriously, as did Samarang, Jog- i jakerta, Sourakerta, and Sourabaya. The thousand ! temples at Brambaman were greatly damaged, and seme of them destroyed. The dome of the noted Temple of Borobodo was crushed in by falling rocks. The town of Tamerang was swept away by lava, and fully half the population, mostly Javanese, numbering about 1,800, perished. At Speezwyk, red-hot rocks set fire to the houses and swept away all the thickly- settled portions of the town. About 10 bazaars belong- ing to Europeans were destroyed. The river Jacatana, on the banks of which Batavi* is situated, was so com- pletely dammed by lava and debris that its course was changed, and from Franien Bastion it flowed down through Tygers Street and joined the waters of the River Emerades, swelling that stream to such an ex- tent that it rose high on the Castor batteries. Figelenking was almost totally destroyed, and a large number of lives lost. Tha island of Onius, five miles off of the mouth of the Targerang River, and 20 miles east of Batavia, was completely inundated and the boating dock totally destroyed. Baby and Cheriboo islands lost a few houses and inhabitants upon them. In Batavia tho roof of tha Governor's house was crushed in by a mass of mud, and three servants were killed. Midah Island, 10 miles off on the coast of Java, was almost wholly engulfed. The towns of Anjer, Tjiringine, and Telokbelong are reported as destroyed, and all lighthouses alone: tho Sunda Strait have disap- peared. The aspect of the Strait is much changed, and the navigation is dangerous. Some 900 inhabitants of the town of Waronge are known to have been killed, and at Talatoa, on the coast, 300 bodies have been found. From all over the island come reports of loss of life f-.nd property, and it is thought that the estimate of 75,000 will not prove excessive. On the lowlands of Eatavia, where the waters have receded, hundreds of bruised and mangled bodies are lying exposed. Amsterdam, Sept. 3. It is not yet possible to collect tho data on which a trustworthy calculation can be founded. In any case the loss of life is expected by competent judges to turn out vastly larger than any estimate hitherto published. In North Bantam there were till recently half-a-million Javanese inhabitants, but a considerable migration has taken place, owing to the diminishing productivity of tho soil or"" late years. Nevertheless, it is considered pro- bable that from SO,OOO to 100,000 natives have perished in this district, as the population of Anjer and Tjiringen alone was nearly CO,OOO. An extensive plain of volcanic stone has been formed in the sea near Lam- pong, Sumatra, which renders communication impos- sible with Telokbetong aad the south-west of Java. The Hague, Sept. 4. An official despatch states that Telok Ectong, in Sumatra, has probably been totally destroyed. No news has bean received from Lampong. At Tjivirgen 10,000 were drowned.",English,THE AWFUL VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS IN JAVA.
1883-09-07,0000406- The Western Gazette,krakatoa,1,"THE DESTRUCTION OF MERAK. Amsterdam, Aug. 4. No intelligence has arrived at Batavia from the Dutch Residents in tho South Suraatran province of Lampong. It is concluded that Telokbetong has been entirely destroyed. The "" First Point,"" Java, and the "" Vlakke Hock"" Lighthouses are still in existence, but the light in the latter is no longer burning. The Dutch Conlroleur at Hatimbong, which forms the extreme south-eastern point of Lampong, has been saved, along with all the members of his'family. The fact is im- portant as indicating that the destruction in that quarter has not been so overwhelming as had hitherto been apprehended ; that, at any rate, it is not absolute. Further particulars havo been received from t>j» «wa!tt .wowing that at MaraV. which -wxh situated only three miles from Erakakoa, the destruction is complete. Not a vestige of the place now remains. A fort was built there many years sgo, and in 1877 extensive quarries were opened in the neigh- bourhood in order to supply stone for the construction of the new piers and dock 3 in the harbour of Batavia. There were other extensive industries carried on at the | spot, including railway and ironworks, and there was I also a large dynara'te store connected with the quarries. 1 The latter were 300 feet deep, and had within the past five or six years supplied not less i than a million and a-half tons of rock. Altogether i there were some thousands of labourers employed at i Merak. They were mostly natives, the number of the ; Europeans having dropped off since , the completion of | the Batavia harbour works. The dwelling-houses, ' shops, and business offices stood on an elevated site, about 150 feet above tho level of the sea. Of tho ' population of Merak it has now been ascertained that, with th* exception of one European book- keeper and two natives, every soul has been : drow.ied. There is not a building left ! standing, and every bit of property, including all the ! stores and raw materials, has been completely swept '. away. In this single spot the loss is estimated at a hundred thousand pounds. With regard to the tidal wave, intelligence have been received from Taudiong Priok, stating that at thatpiace, 58 miles distant from | Krakatoa, a sea seven and a-half feet higher than the ordinary highest level, suddenly rushed in and over- whelmed the place. Immediately afterward it as suddenly sank ten and a-half feet below the h'gh-water mark, the effect being most destructive.",English,THE DESTRUCTION OF MERAK.

As the Comtesse de Ghambord was not to be persuaded to alter the decision she had formed, the two Princes of Orleans preferred to stay away altogether from the ceremony. Madagascar.—Durban, Aug. 31 ( Times). — The Taymouth Castle has arrived here from Mauritius and Madagascar. Her commander could not communi- cate with Tamatave. The town is still occupied by the French. Admiral Pierre is at Reunion, waiting for a steamer to proceed to France. Ho is said to From ophthalmia. Mr. Shaw, the miscktimry, is a pas- senger on board the Tayinonth Castle for Kngland. He complains bitterly of the treatment which he received while on board the French flagship. The French state- nmt that several engagements were fought at Tamatave, in which the Hovas were defeated, with loss, is not to be iltogether depended upon.—Messrs. Donald Currie and Ik), have received the following telegram from Natal, respecting the steamship Taymouth Castle, which arrived there on Friday morning from Mauritius: —""Taymouth Castle was at Tamatave 11th inst.

PIBTHdtaABITZBCRG, Sept. 2 (Daily NewsJ.—the Taymouth dropped the mail on Friday at Dnrban with- out communicating further. She proceeds immediately to the Cape. Mr. Shaw is on board. He was kept a dose prisoner on the French flagship for over two months, being brought thrice to trial before the Naval Court, ind ultimately discharged. He was denied all papers and books except the bible. The offence charged against him was not stated. Paris, Sept. I.—An official despatch from Tamatave ilated August 26 confirms the news of the death of the tjueen of the Hovas, which took place on the 13th of July. She has been succeeded by her niece, who takes the title of Queen Ranavalo 111. The Prime Minister remains in power. The Pietennaritzburg correspondent of the Daily News tends the first authenticated narrative of Mr. Shaw's treatment at the hands of the French in Madagascar. Ihe substance of Mr. Shaw's case, which he has for- warded to the Imperial Government, is that he was charged falsely with harbouring spies, and wa* impri- lened ashore. He was then taken on board the Nievre, ind charged with attempting to poison the French troops. Twenty-two days after the first charge was made he was charged with another offence. He was never tried by court-martial, but was periodically exa- mined on freshly trumped-up accusations. When finally released he was on the verge of starvation. Zulttland.—Durban, Sept. 1 (Times). — About 400 men of the 41st Regiment, including mounted infantry, are now marching from Verulam to Stanger, 15 miles this side of the Lower Tugela. Their final destina- tion is kept secret. Colonel Montgomery is in command. Stanger is 50 miles from Middle Drift, beyond which is Inkankla Bush, the place of Cetewayo's refuge. In the absence of official tidings it is difficult to know what is actually going on. A private correspondent at Inkankla, writing on August 19, says that Mr.Osborne waited three days to see the King, when a letter was sent for Mr. Osborne. Cetewayo, however, fled into the bush when the Resident, with a small mounted escort, came in view of the kraal. As armed parties seemed to be gathering en the hill-tops around, Mr. Osborne deemed it prudent to return. The Ekowe Usutu partjr are rallying again in the relerve, it is reported, with a view of proceeding again against Usibepu. The latter is said to have killed Sotkele, a chief, near St. Lucia Bay, destroying and dispersing his tribe. Europeans in Zululand maintain that the only way to establish peace is an armed occupa- tion of the Reserve, whither Vmnyamana and Umlabuko are on their way to join the King. The Pietermaritzburg correspondent of the Daily News telegraphs:—The followers of Onyanaa, the Prime Minister, are crossing into the reserve by ones and twos. This gives rise to the suspicion that the case of that chief is hopeless. Carnage and plunder continue. Hlubi has, under orders, mustered his fighting men. It is believed that a combined movement is to be made to disband the armed party with Cetewayo. Durban, Sept. 5 (Jleuter). —Cetewayo, at the head of a strong force, is still in the Reserve territory. He maintains a defiant attitude towards Mr. Osborn, the British Resident, and declines all intervention of the colonial authorities. The Zulu King has summoned the Usutus to join him. Afghanistan.—Calcutta, Sept. 2 ( Times). — It was rumoured here last week that the Important tribe of the Ghilzais had risen against the Ameer. There was no trnth in the report. The Ghilzais are doubtless dis- contented at the Ameer's having raised their tribute, snd held them responsible for the raid made recently on a caravan near Jagdalak. But Mag Mahomed Khan, one of their leading chiefs, has just waited on the Ameer at Mama-Khel; and Khan Mahomed Khan, another important chief, has started to try and recover the pro- perty for which the tribe is held answerable. Many other influential Ghilzais are with the Ameer. There have been disturbances among the Zurmat and Kullowaz, in which Mushk-i-Alim is believed to have been impli- aited ; but General Katab Khan, with a small force, easily quelled them, destroying many forts, among them that of Mushk-i-Alim. The rumour of the Ameer's assassination appears to have been started by some lervants of the British Envoy, Afzul Khan, who bad been dismissed and sent back to Peshawur. Italy and Mobocco.—Gibraltar, Aug. 31. — The Italian war vessel Barbarigo arrived at Tangier on Wednesday last from All Zali with Sid Suiesi, the Governor of Rabat, on board. The latter on landing proceeded to the Italian Embassy, and before all the Italian officers there present offered an apology to Signor Scovasso, the Italian Envoy, as satisfaction for illegal lets committed against Italian subjects in Morocco. The ipology having been accepted, the difficulty between Italy and Morocco is believed to be nearly settled.— Tangier, Aug. 31.—The demands of Italy have been uartly conceded by Morocco, and a complete peaceful settlement of the difficulty between the two countries is shortly expected Hungary.—Vienna, Aug. 31.—1n Hungary the bands of rioters not only commit robberies, but set bouses on fire, and murder the Jews that fall into their hands. Two villages have been entirely burned down. Fires break out simultaneously in several places, and never anywhere but in the houses of Jews. Enormous quantities of corn have been burns 1. The outrages have been carefully planned. They were to commence all at unce at the annual market of Egerczeg, but bands of young men out of work, who call themselves Hungarian Kihilists, hurried matters on. At Szentpeter on the night jf the 29th a merchant wait robbed and then murdered. 1 lie son of an old Jew whom masked men were murder- ing managed to save his mother and bis sisters by shoot- mg the aggressors, whose bodies the mob carried off. Hundreds of Jews fled to Kanissa, leaving their property behind. Some of the reports, however, must be received with caution. According to one, some houses were set ""ii tire, and the Jews thrown into the flames. In some 'uses respectable persons mingled with the plundarerg, and the next day returned all they could lay their hands <«n to those who had been robbed. The Jews are urged to remain in their homes, and to make use of firearms. The Volcanic Eruption in Java.—Batavia, August 29 (Reuter). —Sixteen volcanoes have appeared between the site where Krakatoa stood and Sibisle Island. The Soengepan volcano has split into five. A portion of the Residency of Bantam is an ashy desert. The cattle are without food, and the population m lespair.—August 90 : Dead bodies are now being re- covered. In the district of Tanara 704 have already been buried, in the coast village of Kramat 300, mostly Chinese, and in the district of Seraiig 40. On the 27th August a tidal wave from 12 to 30 mitres in height swept the coast of Merak as far as Tniringin. The towns jf Arijer, Merak, and Ttdringin were overwhelmed, together with all the Government buildings ; and the lighthouses at Vierdepunt, in Java, and Vlakkebock, in Sumatra, were likewise destroyed. The aspect of the Straits of Sunda has undergone a complete transformation. .Batavia, August 31.—There is no news from the Sumatra coast. The destruction of Tolott-Betong was reported by the captain of the steamship Governor- General. London, belonging to Batavia, who was at sea Ut the height of the eruption, and steamed to AnJer to ?ive the alarm, but found that place destroyed. His ship had a layer of ashes 18 inches thick on her deck. In some places masses of floating pumice-stone seven feet in depth were passed. In the district of Tjiringen the loss of life is estimated at 10,000. Some estimates place the total loss of life in the Straits through the eruption at over 30,000. ■' < Probably no volcanic eruptions in the world have been physically so terrible as some of these In Java, though •>'e Italian eruptions have brokon in more conspicuously on the art and civilisation of the world.

It has been the singular fortune of the Royal Faintly of Denmark to ally itself in the preseflt> genera- tion with two of the peat Royal Houses of BUMpe and to giro a Sovereign M Greece. The occasions whtn the several members of a fhmfly so dispersed can meet together must necessarily be rare and are naturally wel-« come when they occur. The King of Greece with his Queen, the Princess of Wales, the Empress of Russia with her Imperial husband, the Duehesr of OmalMlind, the youngest daughter Of the King of Denmark, are now all assembled in a family gathering a* Copenhagen. A somewhat original irtyle of spending a honeymoon is reported from Russia. When Count Sbereinetieff the other day married the Countess Heyden, he hired the steamer Oleg, which is now taking them up the Volga. Hie Druslina Steamboat Company, to whom the steamer belongs, receives a payment of 30/. a day, in return for which sum the Count may travel how and where he likes. Numerous wedding guests accompany the Count and Countess Sbereinetieff ; and the party on board the Oleg includes a band, 20 singers, a photo- grapher, a physician, male and female cooks, bemdes a numerous staff of servants. A special despatch to the News from Lam- pasas, Texas, says. ""A carriage, containing the skeletons of three adults and two children, sitting bolt upright, SS if in life, under a large tree, has been found near a road in Llano County. The tree was shattered by lightning. It is supposed the carriage sought shelter under the tree and was struck, the bolt killing the inmates and the horses. The weather-beaten appearance of the carriage and its trimmings indicates that the event happened a year or two ago. In a small trunk was a letter addressed to 'James G. Chamberlain, London, England.' The parties are supposed to have been tourists. The spot where they were found is very secluded, and far from every habitation."" A disastrous accident has occurred in the Swiss valley of Wessthall. A bridge crossing the WesS had just been built at Zell Kykon, and on Friday the first vehicles —waggons with bales of cotton—were being taken across it. The opening of the bridge was being celebrated with much rejoicing in the quiet locality, and local magnates were witnessing the inauguration. When, however, a very heavy weight of waggons was allowed to remain stationary for a minute or two in the very centre of the bridge, the structure was unable to support this excessive weight, and gave way. The horses and wag- gons were precipitated into the rapidly flowing river. Among others who were accompanying the waggons on this first passage over the new bridge were the Mayor of the township of Zell, who was killed, a French sub-con- tractor named Gominelle, who received injuries which must prove fatal, a member of the Zurich Council, who was terribly hurt, and a number of workmen, some of whom have lost their lives ; bnt the exact number of deaths has not yet been ascertained. A Curious Sentence. —A curious sentence was passed recently by Judge Krekel, of the United States District Court in Missouri. An illiterate man having been convicted of a minor offence, he was ordered by the Judge to be detained ift gaol until he should be able to read and write ; and another offender, less ignorant, was sentenced to be similarly imprisoned until he should have instructed the former in those valuable arts. It is state ! that in three weeks the man reappeared able to write fairly well from dictation, and both pupil and master were discharged. A Fight with Brigand*.—Our Naples corre- spondent writes : —"" Accounts come from Cantanzaro of a severe conflict with a band of brigands. For some time it had been known that this band was disquieting the neighbourhood of the Sila in Cosenza (Calabria), and search had been made. On the 17th of last month the whereabouts of the brigands was ascertained, and two parties were sent to the place. On the 25th the brigands were overtaken, and a furious combat took place, lasting three hours. The chief of the band, Giovanni Ricca, was killed, and his father and cousin hurt, but they succeeded in escaping. Five of the attacking party were wounded, one dangerously."" The Irish Leaders in America.—The New York correspondent of the Daily News says the alarming rumours said to have reached England concerning the revival of the Irish conspiracy in America are received here incredulously. It is well known that Irish interest in the agitation is more stagnant than it has been for years. Instead of combining for fresh exertion, the Irish leaders are quarrelling among themselves. Rossa and his faction are denouncing McDermott as a spy in the pay of England, and declaring that he has no information of value to give. Rossa says to-day that the conspiracy will revive and keep reviving until the English are killed out of Ireland. John Devoy says Rossa was in league with McDermott to betray the Irish plans, and that his organization protects and encourages informers. It says: ""The blackguardism practised by Rossa, and sustained by Patrick Ford, is calculated to drive every self-respecting man out of the national movement, and make the name of Irish Revolutionist a byword and a term of contempt."" Desperadoes in America.—Twenty-five miles north of Hot Springs, Arkansas, is a wild, mountainous country, inhabited by desperadoes who have of late terrorised the people. On the 18th of April, a press despatch states, their career was begun by the cold- blooded murder of Wm. Potter, a well-to-do farmer and peaceable citizen, who was shot down while at work in his field without a word of warning. The men who com- mitted the deed were the two Daniels brothers and one Rial Blocker. Immediately Governor Berry took active measures to suppress the gang, and issued a proclamation offering 200 dols. reward each for their arrest. The des- peradoes established themselves in a strongly fortified gorge at the junction where Montgomery, Yell, and Gar- land counties corner, and continued their raids. A church building in the neighbourhood was sacked and burned to the ground. Later a respectable farmer, Manneo Baldwin, was called to his door at midnight and shot down in the presence of his wife. On one occasion the men went to a church meeting in Baxter township, Garland county, heavily armed with Winchester rifles, and interrupting the minister bade the congregation to remain quietly in their seats. The leader of the gang walked up to the pulpit, handed the minister a note, and commanded him to read it. The note warned certain members of the congregation that their efforts to sup- press the banditti would, if continued, lesult in their unconditional ""removal."" The situation became more and more serious. Within the last few weeks measures were taken to bring matters to a crisis. Armed posses, accompanied by guides and bloodhounds, were started out to run down the outlaws. The pursuing parties were composed of resolute men who were fully aroused to the importance of their mission. One of the parties struck a due, and at once put bloodhounds at work. The fugitive outlaws were traced to one of their mountain fortifica- tions, and a fight ensued, in which two of the pursuing party were killed and one was shot seriously. The out- laws, after enticing the pursuers into a narrow gorge, ambushed them. Only four shots were fired by the desperadoes. The pursuers made a bold stand, but their incessant firing proved futile against the concealed ban- dits. The fugitives evaded their pursuers without receiv- ing the least injury. They succeeded in killing one of the bloodhounds, and several others were wounded. The pursuers sent to Hot Springs for reinforcements, and to Little rock for bloodhounds. A dozen men from the Hot Springs started when the despatch left, and they would be joined by others. Governor Berry has taken active steps towards suppressing the desperadoes, and his action is heartily approved. Fatal Railway Accident in Germany.—A terrible railway accident occurred at Steglitz on Sunday night. Steglitz is a favourite place of resort of Berliners, and lies on the Potsdam and Magdeburg railway, three mileß to the south-west. The accident, which may be called a massacre, stands probably unique in the annals of railway disasters. It being both Sunday and the Sedan anniversary, the place was crowded with excur- sionists to the Schuetzenfest and other festivities in honour of the day. By ten a crowd of about 500 persons filled the platform of the railway station watting for the return train. When the latter arrived, after some delay on the up line the barriers still remained closed to await the passing of the Cologne night express, which leaves Berlin at 9*50 p.m. Suddenly, however, the pressure of the impatient crowd foroed the barriers aside, and despite the efforts of the railway officials, hundreds rushed across the down line to enter the cars. At that very moment the express came tearing along, and although the driver, on seeing the danger signals displayed at the last moment, applied the brakes, the train dashed right through the mass of people covering the line, and annihilated everything in its way. One terrible cry of anguish arose even above the thunder of the train, and all was over. The details of this terrible scene, lasting only a few seconds, as narrated by eye witnesses, are almost too harrowing for repetition. Forty persons, of whom 17 Were men, 18 women, and five chil- dren, were instantly killed, and about 25 wounded. All the victims belong to the artisan and labouring classes. For a distance of 100 yards the line was covered with bodies, all shockingly mutilated, and human fragments. Of one family ofrfive persons only one boy escaped. The killed include four married couples, five members of the Shooters' Company, with the flagbearer and three artil- lery corporals. One of the latter had both legs and his heavy sabre cut through as with a knife. One girl had nearly reached the local train when the draught caused by the express throw her under the locomotive. One woman had both lags out off, and on being carried into the waiting-room gave birth to a dead child and expired. Another woman and a sailor la the Imperial navy were completely decapitated. A child had one hand cut off, and one body was entirely divested of clothing. The driver of the express train bad to be relieved, being un- able to proceed after witnessing the scene of carnage. His locomotive was covered with pieces of flesh, bones, rags, and drenched with blood. The line remained Mocked for hours, while detachments of firemen and soldiers gathered the remains of the victims by torch- light. . -■-•> ■' v, . ' :r ~ v 1 '",English,General News of the Week.
1883-09-08,0000319- Leamington Spa Courier,krakatoa,1,"THE VOLCANIC EEUPTION IN JAVA. ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND LIVES LOST. J A telearam from the Amsterdam of the t Standard says that the loss of life by the disaster in Java « is expected by competent judges to turn out vastly larger ( than any estimate hitherto published. It is now believed that from 80,000 to 100,000 natives have perished in the ‘ Bantam district. 1 The Now York correspondent of the Daily jVetca sends a f more detailed account than had previously been published t of the eruption. Ho says The disturbances began on » the island of Krakatoa on Saturday. August 25, when deep ( rumblings were distinctly audible at Suraperta and ? Batavia. Little alarm was felt at first, but within a few ] hours showers of stones began to fall, and all through the ( night showers of red hot stones and ashes fell. Bv J morning all communications with Anjer on the Strait of ‘Sunda, were destroyed, bridges being wrecked, and roads t rendered impassable. The disturbances had extended beneath the waters of the Strait, and they were boiling i and hissing violentlv, while great waves dashed on Java’s i •shores. The temperature of the sea rose nearly twenty « degrees. The rumblings gradually became more and c more distinct, and by noon of the same day Maha Meru, , the largest of the volcanoes, was belching forth flames at t an alarming rate. This eruption soon spread to Gunung < Guntur, and manv other minor mountains, until more j than a third of the' forty-five craters of Java were either t in active eruption or seriously threatening. Just before : dusk a great luminous cloud formed over Gunung Gun- j lur, and the crater of that volcano began to emit i enormous streams of white and sulphurous mud and ■ lava, which were rapidly succeeded by explosions, followed by tremendous showers of cinders and enormous , fragments of rock, which wore hurled high into the air , and scattered in all directions, carrying death and des- truction with them. Overhanging clouds were so charged with electricity that at one time more than fifteen huge waterspouts were seen. Mon, women, andchildren rushed in terror from their tottering dwelling- places, filling the air with shrieks of horror. Hundreds , wore unable to get out before the houses fell, and were buried beneath great masses of rocks and mud. _ On .Sunday evening the shocks and eruptions mcreaseci in violence, and the island seemed threatened with sub- mersion. At the same time enormous waves began to dash with greater force upon the shores, coming in some places far up into the interior, and great chasms opened in the earth, threatening to engulf the people and build- ings. About midnight the most frightful scene of oil took place. Suddenly an enormous luminous cloud, •similar to that over Gunung Guntur, but much greater in extent, formed over the Kandang range of mountains which skiit the south-east coast of the island. This .cloud graduall}' increased in size until it formed a canopy lurid reel and whitish grey over a wide extent of territory. During this time the eruptions increased, and streams of ’•lava poured incessantly down the sides of the mountains 'into the valleys, sweeping everything before them. About two o’clock on Monday morning this great cloud suddenly broke into small sections and vanished, and when daylight came it was seen that an enormous tract of land had disappeared, extending from Point Cnpucin on the south, to Negery Passoerang, on the north and west, to the lowest point, covering about fifty square miles, llore were situated the villages of Negery and Negery Baba wan"". None of the inhabitants of these places ■escaped d”eatli. The entire Kandang range of mountains extending along the coast in a semicircle for «jbmjt 55 miles, had gone out of sight. The waters of Bay in the Sunda Straits, and Pepper Bay on the east, and the Indian Ocean on the south, had rushed m and formed a sea of turbulent waters. On Monday night the volcano of Papandayang was in an active state of paroxysmal eruption, which was aecam- mnied hy detonations which nro said to have been hoard for many miles away. In Sumatra three distinct columns of Same were seen to rise from a mountain to a . height, and its whole surface was soon covered wtth nory Sava streams which spread In great distances on nil sides. Stones fell for miles around, and black fragmentary matter carried into the air caused total darkness. A whirlwind accompanied this eruption, by 'T 1 . 1 ,. • ' roofs, trees, men, nnd horses were carried into the n r Suddenly the scene changed. The mountain """" ""P ll ' Into seven harts without a moment s warning, and where Papamiayang had stood alone were now seven distinct parks, in the open seams of which could he seen great halls of molten matter. From the Assures potued forth Clouds of steam and black ejected lava, which flowing m steady streams, ran slowly down the moun am sides, forming beds two hundred or rhrec hundred feet in extent. One of the most singular incidents was the sudden rising «n the forenoon of Tuesday of fourteen new volcanic tnnnntains in the Straits of Sunda, forming a cnnpleto chain in almost a straight line between Point St-“S on tlie Java .-oast, nnd Hoga Point on the coast of Sh™.™ almost, on lhe tops of what had been Merak and Man-K which sank into the sea on the previous da}. ■This writer estimates the loss of life at 75,000.

1883-09-08,0000418- The Cambridge Independen,krakatoa,1,"THE TERRIBLE DISASTER IN JAVA. So Rrent have been the violence and extent of the volcanic eruption that the number of lives lost has been estimated at 100.000, and the formation of the land above ami below water completely changed. A tidal wave, thirty metre* high, follow- ing the eruption of Krakatoa, destroyed Anjer on the north coast and swept away the fort, wnicn was occupied by a Dutch garrison. The wune wave devastated the neighbouring towns of Mcrak ana Tjirinpin, with the Government buddings ana rice warehouses, and in the former place £ n ly two natives were saved. In North Bantam there was an enormous loss of life, all the food supplies were destroyed, and the people fled into the The coffee and sugar crops have suffered greatly, and the cattle are said to be dying for want of food. From other places in the western part of the island come reports of destruction to hte ana property. Across the Sunda Straits the °* Sumatra has also suffered terribly. The Standard correspondent at the Hague says:— For a distance exceeding five miles everything nas been destroyed, and many thousands of Jives have been lost. The native population are furious against the Dutch, believing that the calamity is a punishment from benven for the war in Acheenand it is found to he dangerous for any European to approach the people. This statement, however, requires confirmation, as the Lampongs are naturally a very timid race; and probably the present excitement is a con9--quenf» of the priests working upon the fanaticism of their followers. The lighthouse at Lampong has not yet been relighted. The damage at sea was not so great as on land. The war steamer Siak and the floating dock Amsterdam were driven ashore at Purrnerend, and the Nederland Company’s steamship Wilhelmina at Priok. By Thursday 701 dead bodies had been discovered and buried in the district of Tanara, 300, mostly Chinese, at Kramat, and forty in the district of Serang. A telegram from Batavia, dated August 29. reports The temperature fell ten degrees on the 27th, but is now normal. The native huts all along the beach are washed away. The birds roosted durisg the ash rain, and the cocks crowed ns it cleared away. The town is covered with a thin layer of ashes, giving the roads a quaint bright look. The lighthouses in the Straits have disappeared, and the volcano of Krakatoa has crumbled sway into the sea. Sixteen volcanic craters have ap- peared between that spot and Slebese, while the Soengepan volcano has split into five. An exten- sive plain of volcanic stone has been formed in the sea near Lampong, Sumatra, which renders com- munication impossible with Telokbetong and the south-west of Java. In places, mases of pumice stone seven feet thick have been met with. In fact, the eruptions have so altered the Straits that the charts nave become useless, and the Ad- miralty have ordered her Majesty’s ship Cbamnion, Magpie, and Flying Fish to survey the Straits and report the changes which have been made as regardsn avigation. Two vessels of the American squadron have also been ordered to examine the state of affairs. For the relief the sufferers, the Straits Government have volunteered 25.000 dollars, and the Java Government have subscribed 5,000 gudders. The Dutch Trading Company’s factory and other large firms have telegraphed for sanction to subscribe similarly. Relief committees have been formed at Batavia, Amsterdam, and The Hague ; that at the capital is presided overby the Prince of Orange; and among the members are the Presidents of both Legislative Chambers, members of the Council of State, of the High Court of Justice, of the Chamber of Commerce, and of the Municipal Bodies, including the Burgo- master of The Hague. Two soldiers, named McKensie and Gillan- dere, both belonging to Nairnshire, were drowned on the 29th ult. while bathing at Fort George. The National Thrift Society are making arranKementa for bolding a large number of tbrif meet- ings throughout London and the aurroundiog diatricta during the autumn and wintar months. ▲ Curious Sentence—A curious sentence was passed recently by Judge Krekel, of the United States District Court in Missouri. An illiterate man having been convicted of a minor offence, he was ordered bv the judge to be detained in gaol until be should be able to read and write; and another offsnder, leas ignorant, was sentenced to be similarly imprisoned until he should have instructed the former in those valuable arts. It is stated that in three weeks the man reappeared able to write fairly well from dictation, and both pupil and master were discharged. Decrease of German Population.— There has been a remarkable diminution in the population of Germany of late, the number having fallen between the Ist December, 1880, and the 6th June, 1882, from 45.234,061 to 45J213.900. This decrease, however, is spread over the country in an unequal manner, there being in some parts of Prussia—such as Westphalia, Brandenburg, and Berlin—a slight increase to the amount of 8,149 inhabitants : while, on the other hand, Posen has lost 37,780, East Prussia 31,617, and Pome- rania 22,232. Bavaria, which in 1880 possessed 5.284.778 people, has now lost 23.186 : Wurtemburg hat lost 14,052 out of its 1,971.118 : and the Grand Duchy of Baden 11,767 out of 1,579,254. The kingdom of Saxony has been more fortunate, and has received an accession of 42,017 to its population in 1880 of 2,972,805. Alsace- Lorraine has suffered a heavy loss in proportion to its numbers, there having been in eighteen months a decrease of *87,090 out of its 1.566,670 inhabitants in 1880. The Ecclesiastical Legislation of the Past Session.—The Liberator says:—“As regards the cause of reUgiuus equality, we are obliged to adroit that the advance made has. so far as legislative measures are concerned, been but alight. The onlv two successes are in connection with private Bills for abolishing vexatious local ecclesiastical imposts, viz , vicar's-rates in Trinity Parish, Coventry, and church-rates in St. Saviour's, Southwark. The burials question bos moved forward to this extent, that leading Conservatives and Churchmen in the House of Commons have declared themselves favourable to the principle of the Cemeteries Bill, and that the Home Secretary has now nublicly pledged the Government to see what can be done to remove the difficulties experienced in the working of the burial laws. All Church reform measures have fared badly, in the sense that they have scarcely bad a chance of being discussed. It is noteworthy that the only Bill dealing with the sale of livings was that of Mr. Leathern, Mr. Stanhope and his supporters having maintained a strange silence on the subject all this year.” The Report of the Royal Commission on Church Courts.—The Liberator, writing before the appearance of the report, and judging from the pub- lished abstract of its contents, sayslt completely revolutionises our judicial procedure in ecclesiastical cases, and it does so apparently in the interest of those who have set the courts as they are, and the law they administer, at defiance. The Ritualistic journals, while holding their final judgment in reserve until the report itself appears, have yet received the announcement of its contents with unconcealed delight. And they would, we believe, have good ground for their exultation if the recommendations of the Commission were equivalent to an alteration of the law. But the Commission can only recommend—the Legislature must decide ; and the friends of the Established Church must be extremely sanguine if they expect to obtain the approval of Parlia- ment for this wholesale scheme of reconstruction. It appears to us that the Commissioners in their anxiety to satisfy the Church, and especially one section of it. have too much lost sight of the nation ; and we have little doubt that their bold attempt to secure for the Establishment a semi-independent position will fall, and, failing, will very probably expedite its fall"" An American Gambling City.—According to a correspondent of an American contemporary gambling is plainly the most important business in Louisville. It gives character to five or six of the choicest squares in the cemraercial part of the town, and exceeds any other branch of trade in volume of transactions. The pooling rooms handle not less than 6.000. 000dol. (£1,275,000) a year. The faro banks do a business of about 3,000,000d01. (£637,500). The winnings and losings of the numerous poker rooms amount to 2.000. 000dol. (£425.000) at a moderate estimate; the keno banks absorb about 1,000,000d01. (£212,500) in the course of each year, mainly the wages of labouring men. and the lottery offices, of which there are over 100, scattered like drug stores all over town, receive and keep 500.000d01. (£106,250) at least, hxlf of which comes from the negroes. These estimates make a total of 12.500,000d01. (£2,606.250). Along the east side of Third- street about half of the pedestrians taro aside into the pool-rooms, and the business within can be seen and heard by every passer-by. There is no fear of the law, and the proprietors are in some instances as enterprising as ready-made clothing dealers. The “Crockford"" faro bank is the most gorgeous place in the city. The broad stairway rises flush from the sidewalk and the double plate-glass doors, embellished with the name of the place in a rich stained-glass design, are kept open daring the hot weather. At the top of the easy flight of stairs sits a polity-looking mulatto mao. dressed in spotless white linen. His duty is not to give warning of the ap- proach of the police—they never come in an unfriendly way—but to receive and direct desirable visitors and to turn back all bankrupts and hoodlums. The rooms are richly frescoed and lighted by electricity. Other houses, thongh less gorgeous, are not ashamed to display their finery before the public, and even the meanest of the faro banks have conspicuous signs to tell what they are. Tbs noisiest of the gambling places are the keno banks, which are frequented by the rougher elements of the gambling community. At one of these places, much frequented by negroes, a prize is given the winner of the first pot each Saturday night It is sometimes a turkey and sometimes a bam, but during the season of that favourite frui* it is always a half-dozen of the largest watermelons. This gambling, the correspondent declares, owes its unprecedented prosperity almost en- tirely to the protection and encouragement of certain officials, who have two great reasons for assisting it—it pays them handsome fees at regular intervals and, if they behave themselves discreetly, it will probably re- elect them. The proprietary gamblers are all money- spending politicians and some of them are office-holders. 000 of them, named Waddell, besides, is a large lender of money, is a stockholder in several legitimate enter- prises, and works a large farm in Tennessee, near Nash- ville. Formerly he owned the largest gambling house in Nashville and spent a part of every year in that city, hut one right, seven or eight years ago. he killed a man there, and since that event be has lived continuously in Louisville, taking only occasional trips to his farm. The damage done in Louisville by these men and their followers is, the correspondent says, incalculable and irreparable A census of the sufferers, direct and in- direct. would run far up into the thousands, but the figures would give only a faint idea of the extent of the evil.",English,THE TERRIBLE DISASTER IN JAVA.

THE BALLOON VOYAGE ACROS3 THE CHANNEL Writing from Boulogne respecting Mon?h:r L'Hoste s balloon voyage across the Channel, t correspondent remarks : Tho coveted distinction of being the first to cross the Channel from tha French side has been gained by the well-kr. and enterprising young aeronaut, Mon-:;ar L Hoste. The result has only been attain:! after several unsuccessful efforts. The rrst time he went up from Boulogne in cm- pany with Monsieur Elvlx, the fca. a fell at Desvres, a little town about twelve miles inland. On the second oc»sfc> he went up alone at midnight, and n'tsl descending near Dunkirk in the morning, st?rtid afresh, and was picked up in the North :-ea ty a fishing-boat Nothing daunted by the perils from which he had narrowly escaped, hr vlj two subsequent ascents, and each time c.:r.a down at Dixmude, a little town in Be'gium. In recognition of his energy a subscription tvaa started at Boulogne to provide him with a r » balloon, to be called ""The Ville de Eouloyna* sur Mer,"" and it was with this that ho effected I his ascent from the Tuileries Gardens at Boulogne, last Sunday afternoon, at the o'clock, in presence of a large cr'.»i of spectators. The »iud at starting was exceedingly light, and so as not to over- weight the balloon the aeronaut had to leave be- hind an amateur who hact arranged to accompany him. The wind carried the balloon in a north- easterly direction ; but half-an hour afterward! it was caught by a south south east current, and, after Hoating awhile above the piers, it took its course over tho Straits at a height of a thousand yards. Wishing to be informed as to the land current, M. L'Hoste dropped down to about nj hundred and fifty yards to question the fisher- men, whose ""macks were beneath him and alsothJ tug Faidherbe, which had followed him out t the harbour. Having obtained the necessar in- formation. be threw out ballast, and ascended to a height of UUti yards, and continued a coursf with a south-west wind, which took him tow.rdj Cape Grisne*. At half-past six the bal >oa dropped into the lower current, and kept n a favourable course with th: breeze, which -.are! from east to south-west At halt-pant seven I '3 sides of the Channel were hidden by a thick f 1 '?; but at eight o'clock tho moon rose, and thj aeronaut could make out the steamers < n their way north. He could also distinguish the li_-'- ta at Cape Grisne- and at Dover. At nine ocl clt, believing himself to be near the English coast, he, to test the correctness of his aupposit a, hailed land loudly, and heard the ech l o< his own voice, which proved him rijtt The wind continued to carry him land- wards, and the attention of the aeronaut was attracted by a light of Folkestone. t wasthenata height of :<OO metres.

China.—A serious riot, due to the feeling of hostility to foreigners, has occurred at Canton. In the course of the disturbance much property was destroyed, and in view of the threatening aspect of the natives the European residents took refngs en board the steamers in the river. Two gunboats left Hong Kong on Tuesday for Canton to protect life and property. So far as reported there was no loss of life among the foreign residents during the riot. According to the latest intelligence from Canton tranquillity was restored there. A despatch received in Paris from Ilong Kong gives an account of the occurrences at Canton, according to which the riot was caused by a group of Portuguese killing a Chinaman. The mob, infuriated by this deed, set Are to several houses belonging to foreigners, bnt no Kurope&n was killed, though the Chinese autliorities were slow in repressing the disturbance. France.—A French officer, Major Senaux, of the 134 th Regiment, while commanding some light infantry movements in the Haute Mnrne, was shot in the temple while talking to bib adjutant and fell dead. There was no ball practice, as the morning papers report, and therefore there is great suspicion that he was murdered. The Comte de Chamlonfs Will.—The Vienna corres- pondent of the Daily A'ewe gives particulars of the con- tents of the ""authentic will"" ef the late Comte de Chambord. The document is written, he says, in the fount's own hand. It is dated the 4th of June, and is not signed by witnesses, the Austrian law not dreaming that these were absolutely necessary. It contains no political allusions, but only the arrangements affecting tlie Chambord property, and declares the testator to be at peace with all men, even those who offended him. I'be property consists of four domains—viz., those of I'hanibord in France, St Hubert in Bonat, Hungary, one domain in Galicia, Frohsdorf, and a small ehdleau in Ntyria, besides eight million florins in personal property. The Comtesse de Chambord is to have the full enjoymeut oi all the property excepting the subsequent bequests. After the Countess's death the entire property is to go to the Count's nephews—one-third to Count Bardi, and two-thirds to the Duke of l'arina. The Count bequeaths to his two nieces, the (Jrand Duchesses of Parma and Toscana, half a million francs each, and to the Lyons Institute for propagating the Catholic faith 500,000fr. 40t),000fr. are to be invested for the Pope, the yearly interest to be Peter's pence contributed by the Comte de L'hambord. To the poor of Paris he leaves 100,000 francs, and to the poor of the place wherein he died 20,00') francs. The legacies to the poor are payable immediately. Certain sums are reserved for the reading of a certain number of masses for the late Count's soul. All the servants are to receive pensions. The Spanish Princes are not even alluded to. Admiral Pierre died at noon on Tuesday at Marseilles. He will be chiefly remembered in connection with the re- cent bombardment of Tamatave, and the painful incidents of the arrest ef Mr. shuw for "" giving intelligence to the tnemy,"" and of the Admiral's alleged discourtesy to the late Mr. Consul Pakenhaut in that gentleman's dying moments. South Africa.—Durban, Sept. 9.—Dabula- manzi, Cetewayo's brother, who was reported to have been killed in the recent fighting near Ulundi, has arrived at Grey town, and been placed under arrest there by order of the Magistrate, as he had come from Inkandhis without a pass. West Africa. —Loanda, Aug. 15. —Mr. H. M. Stanley has been far into the interior, but has returned to Stanley Pool. It is believed to be bis intention to proceed up the country again and continue his journey to the east coast, retracing his former .journey. Captain Hansen, of the expedition, has been attacked by natives in the interior. Capr Coast Castlk, Aug. 13 (oid Liverpool).— Messengers arrived here to-day from tlie King of Becqnay to request the intervention of the Colonial Uovernment between Koffee Kalcalli, who has seined the throne, and the party of the ex-King Mensah. Severe fighting, as already announced by cable, took place «n the 3d and 4th instant, and when the messengers left both parties were preparing for another encounter. Kalcalli is reported to have had only seven men killed, while Measah lost 60, including many of his principal supporters. The people of Coomassie dread the return of Koffee Kalcalli, as they were active in dethroning him in 1874. The King of Becquay, who is neutral between the contending parties, has intervened in the hope of preserving Coomassie, which he fears will be depopulated by the new tyrant. Egypt.—A telegram from Khartoum sayH :— ""General Hicks commenced forwarding troops from l>uen on Saturday. He himself follows to-day. It is believed that the minority of the Mahdi's followers will desert, and that there will be no fighting. The Sheiks are tired oi him, and are expected to submit as soon as the army comes to protect them."" The sentence of death recently passed upon thirteen members of the Mustaphazeen Corps for having taken part in the Alexandria massacres has been commuted by the Khedive in the cases of ten of the men to penal ser- vitude for life, on the ground of insufficient evidence. Only three will be banged. The cholera epidemic is subsiding, and the doctors sent from England will, with the exception of three, leave Egypt on the 17th ult. Bulgaria.—The Prince practically a Pri- soner.—A correspondent of the Manchester Guardian telegraphed from Soda on the 7th "" A Russian coup d'etat has been effected in Bulgaria. The breach between Prince Alexander and his Bussian Military Ministers, which had been widening for some time, finally came to a head. The Bulgarian Liberals wished the Prince to form a coalition Ministry, and retnrn to the old Consti- tution, which he had violently abolished, the Russian generals, according to this plan, retaining their posts in the new Ministry. Prince Alexander rejected this pro- posal, and after a stormy interview with the Czar's Special Envoy, M. Jonion, requested the two Russian Mini stern, Generals Soboleff and Kalubarse, to lay down their portfolios, and ordered the Bulgarian Conservative leader, M. Grecoff, to form a new Ministry. Thereupon General fSoboleff, acting on direct orders from the Czar, called on the Prince and refused to take his dismissal. 1 his the Russian followed up by presenting an ultimatum, the principal terms of which were the demission of his full powers by the Prince, the practical dictatorship of the Russian generals, and the convocation of a con- stituent assembly under their auspices to draw up a new Constitution. After contemplating abdication and vainly appealing to the Powers, the Prince has finally decided to yield, and has privately signed a manifesto embodying the Russian conditions. The publication of the manifesto is, however, deferred till the Prince's fit* day, a week bcuce. In spite of this concession the tension is such that the abdication of the Prince seems to me to be inevitable."" In a later message the correspondent adds : —"" The irritation among the Bulgarian national leaders it the Prince's surrender and abject humiliation is intense. One leading politician remarked to me, ' The Prince by his incapacity has converted Bulgaria into a Uussian province.' The question of the Prince's depo- sition will possibly be laid before the Constituent Assembly. The Prince has been for days practically a prisoner in his own palace, it being impossible for him publicly to meet the Minister whom he has dismissed, and who has refused to take his dismissal. The language used to him by the Russian Special Envoy passed all bounds."" Java.—An official despatch to the Hague aunounces that the passage of the Sunda Strait is clear, the only change in its physical features having occurred between the Krakatoa Islands and Seboekoe. The Eeratepunt lighthouse is intact, and the Vlakehoek light- house will be lit within a week. Intelligence from l.ampong reports that the house of the Resident, the fortress, and the prison at Telok Betong are standing. Everything else in the place was destroyed. No par- ticulars have yet been received from the coast districts, but the destruction appears to have been general. Belief lias been sent to several points. The United States. —The Northern Pacific railroad was formally opened on Saturday. President Yillanl drove a golden spike through the last rail at Mullans Tunnel, west of Helena, Montana territory, and afterwards delivered an address. Mr. William M.Evarts, ex Secretary of State, spoke eloquently of the occasion and the enterprise.

While a boat's crew belonging to the Dundee whaler Thetis was fast to a whale in David's Straite en August 7, the rush of the whale through the water caased the boat to capstae, and two of the crew were drowned. All would have parished but for a yooag man who dived and cut the line attached to the whale. One of the crew of the Arctic was freeen to death. A terrible atory, says the Japan Weekly Mail, eomes by telegram from Hiroshima. It Is to the effect that on the night of the 3d nit., at about 10 o'clock, a Are broke out at the gaol and spread with such rapidity that all the buildings from the first to the twelfth ward were destroyed in a very short space of time. In each ward from 30 to SO criminals are confined, and it is stated that the oocupants of the fourth and fifth wards, 01 per- sons in afl, were bnrned to death, while 156 prisoners wore more or less severely injured. One hundred and twenty escaped, but of theso 15 wore recaptured the same night. We trust that the details of this affair have been more than usually exaggerated. The tiUmdairl has an amusing account of the kea, a variety of green parrot in New Zealand, which has lately been placed under ban by the Legislature. Any- body is to have a shilling who kills a kea. It appears that the bird, which is naturally graminivorous, a few years ago, during a severe winter, found it impossible to procure food, and hannted the carcase butchers' sheds to eat bits of mutton. It approved the mutton, though mutton is not indigenous to New Zealand, while the kea is, and presently discovered, whether by inductive ratiocination or experience, that sheep were made of it. Ho it attacked the sheep. Flocks of keas visit the folds at night, settle en the sheep, whoee wool rives a bird a line purchase, and peck and peck till they reach the kidney fat, which they eat, while the poor sheep dies in agony. English dogs also, when thay take to sheep- eating, always gorge themselves with the kidney fat, often neglecting the flesh, and killing sheep after sheep for their dainty. The shepherds in New Zealand some- times lose a sheep a night, and the kea is declared to be as costly a pest as the rabbit. Miss Catherine Booth and Miss Charlestoorth were arrested on Monday afternoon by the police at Geneva on their returu from a Salvationist funeral at Chene Bougeries, near that city. They were accompanied at the time by Mrs. Josephine Butler and "" Colonel"" Clibborn. Miss Booth and Miss Charleswortli were taken to the central police-office, and were subsequently con- ducted to the French frontier in a carriage, escorted by a police-officer. An Important Success in Oyster Culture.— Mr. Ryder, tlio Kinbryologist of the United States Fish Commission, has finally solved the problem of the culture of oysters from artificially impregnated eggs. On the 4th inst., at the (iovenunent station at Stockton, Maryland, there wore many millions of young oysters three-quarters uf an inch in diameter, which had been hatched from eggs artiflcially impregnated 46 days before. This fact is of the utmost importance to oyster culturists thiougliout the world, as from a single ovster several millions of eggs can be obtained by the planting of the artificially-reared spat; thus, oysters may be produced in practically un- limited quantities in any sheltered estuary in temperate climates, and localities in which oysters do not grow can, with great ease, be stocked by seed transplanted in bulk while very .small. Remarkable Marriage.—A remarkable wed- ding took place on the stage of the Buckingham Theatre in Loiiisvillo last month, when Mr. John Zmaris, better known as .Major Mite, 30 years of age, ami 42 inches high, was solemnly married to Miss Marie Nail, aged 33, wlioMe height is only 31 inches. This pair of midgets, who have been travelling all over the world for several vears, fell in love with each other when on exhibition at Pittsburg three months ago, chiefly, it would seem, because they were both of a size, and it must be admitted the area of choice for such dwarfs is exceedingly limited, (to tlie occasion of this stage wedding a great crowd assembled in the theatre. At 9 o'clock the curtain was rolled up, disclosing a stage aet after the style of a fashionable drawing-room. A few momenta after oo'clock the manager's daughter came upon the stage with the licence, which she handed to Judge Hoke, who promptly performed the ceremony, and concluded it by kissing the bride. Then amid the wildest applause the curtain went down upon the fairy-like scene. Icebergs in the Atlantic. —The steamship Hel- vetia has arrived at Montreal, from Antwerp, after a somewhat eventful passage. The Helvetia was com- manded by Captain .Smith, and left Antwerp oa the sth ult. Almost from the time of starting until the 11th the steamer encountered heavy gales, with high seas. On the 12th the weather moderated, when a somewhat thick fog hung over the water. The fog remained for a couple of days. On the morning of the 15th, the vessel was about 150 or 200 miles from the Straits of Belle Isle, when several icebergs came in view. Orders wexe at once given to shut off steam. The steamer then moved slowly, but in a short space of time it was found that she was completely surrounded by these floating moun- tains of ice. The utmost cantion had to be nsed to prevent the steamer being struck by some of the bergs, but finally the vessel was got clear of her dangerous com- panions and brought safely to her destination. Captain Smith said he thought it was the first time that icebergs in such numbers bail been met with so far from shore, and accounted for it by the prevalence of strong westerly winds. Captain Smith's arrival was looked for with much interest at Montreal, owing to the Ludwig being so long overdue. When spoken to about the missing steamer, Captain Smith's replies were anything but hopeful ones— indeed, it was inferred that he did not think the Ludwig or any of the 70 or 80 souls on board of her would ever reach their destination. Sparruics in Australia.—A premium of 6d. per dozen has been placed upon sparrows' heads by the Government of South Australia, acting on the advice of a Commission specially appointed to inquire iuto the ""sparrow question,"" while the aomewhat dispropor- tionate snm of 2*. tW. per 100 is offered for the tiny pale blue eggs of the bird. The bird, which only a few years ago such efforts were made to acclimatise in Australia, and whose first arrival was hailed with greater enthusiasm than would uow be ""displayed on the arrival of a Bend Or, a duchtws, or a prize merino, is now doomed to exter- mination—if that can possibly be achieved. So rapidly have the few pairs which were introduced a few years ago multiplied under the congenial skies and amid the luxuriant vegetation of the Australian colonies, where there are few or none of the checks on their increase which exist in the old country, that the agriculturists complain of the serious injury done by them to their wheat and fruit crops, and have called upon the Govern- ment to devise some means of insuring their destruction. The evidence given before the Commission appointed to inquire into the matter affords eloquent examples of the destructiveness of these hard-billed birds. One witness says that in the short space of ten days the sparrows took a tou and a half of grapes. They stripped all the figs off five trees, and kept low 15 acres of lucerne during summer. Another complains that in the season they took 3(M. worth of fruit; while a third declared that be sowed peas three times, and each time they were destroyed by sparrows. The fecundity of the sparrow in South Australia is described as astonishing. A few to-day are thousands next season. Its work is done on a scale disheartening to the cultivator, and nnder con- ditions he cannot control, for the seed is taken out of the ground, the fruit-bud off the tree, the sprouting vegetable as fast as it grows, and the fruit before it is ripe, and therefore before it can be housed and saved. Neither apricots, cherries, figs, apples, grapes, peaches, plums, pears, nectarines, loquats, olives, wheat, barley, peas, cabbages, cauliflowers, nor seeds nor fruit of any kind are spared by its omnivorous bill; and all means of defence tried against its depredations, whether scare- crows, traps, netting, shooting, or poisoning, are declared to be insufficient to cope with the enemy.—Land.",English,General News of the Week.
1883-09-15,0000418- The Cambridge Independen,krakatoa,1,"Railway Accident. —An engine left Vaux- hall station, Yarmouth, on Saturday night for Norwich by the new Ado line, and having proceeded some distance it left the raetals, ploughed up the line for about 80 yards, and ultimately fell into a ditch. The driver and the stoker escaped without injury. The line was blocked, and trains had to be sent by the Keedham route. “A Little Present.”—A little present, in the strictest sense of the phrase, has been lately made to the German Crown Prince and Princess by Herr Hofmann, a machine manufacturer at Osterfcld. in the shape of a ""fairy tea service."" The tea-tray is 32 milli- mHres long by 24 broad, and has been beaten out of an old Prussian ** three"" piece, or halfpenny. The teapot is made out of a German two-pfennig piece (about an English farthing), the cover being made out of a one- pfennig piece The milk-jug is made from a pfennig piece of the Duchy of Saxe-Meiniogen ; the sugar-basin from a Prussian pfennig and a heller. The two cups are made from old pfennig pieces of different German principalities. All the pieces are tinned on the inside, and have been so manufactured that one can without difficulty recognize each coin either from the inscription or the arms stamped upon it. Thf. Java Eruption.—Passage of the Sunda STRAITS —An official despatch announces that the pas a ilge of the Sunda Strait is clear, the only change in its physical features having occurred between the Krakatoa Islands and Seboekoe.

Intelligence from Lampong ” that the house of the Resident, the fortress, and the prison at Telok Betong are standing. Every- thing else in the place was destroyed. No par- ticulars have yet been received from the coast districts, but the destruction appears to Lave been general. Relief has been sent to several points. Alleged Attempt to Drown a Wife.—On Saturday, at the Brentford Petty Sessions. Richard Pierce, 23, captain of the steam-tug Eleanor, was charged on remand with attempting to drown his wife Kate, by pushing her into the Thames at Brentford on the previous Monday week. On the night in question the prosecutrix went on board the toe to ask her husband for some money, as he bad only allowed her Cs. a week to keep herself and three children, notwithstanding the fact that he was in receipt of two guineas. He was sitting near the funnel when she went up to him and immediately he put his legs round her and pushed her over the vessel’s side. A man who was on board held out a hitcher to her, and called on the prisoner to help him to get her out of the water. Prisoner, however, refused to assist, and told him to let her drown. She was in deep water at the time, but was eventually rescued by a man named Barton, who was on board the tu£. —Witnesses were called who swore that to the best of their belief the womuu over the stanchions and fell into the river accidentally.— The magistrates committed the prisoner for trial, and refused to accept bail. Coup D’Etat in Bulgaria.—Prince Alex- ander a prisoner in his Palace.—The Ragusacorrespondent of the Manchester Guardian telegraphs from Sofia. vi& Severin, on Friday, that a Russian conn d'etat has been effected in Bulgaria. The breach between Prince Alexander and his Russian military ministers, which has been widening for some time, finally come to a bead. The Bulgarian Liberals wished the Prince to form a coalition Ministry and return to the old Con- stitution. which he had violently abolished, the Russian generals, according to this plan, retaining their posts in the new Ministry, Prince Alexander rejected this proposal, and after a stormy inter- view with the Czar’? epec ; al envoy, M. Jonin, requested the two Russian Ministers. General Soboleff and Kaulbars, to lay down their port- folios. and ordered the Conservative leader, M. Grecoff to form a new Ministry. Thereupon General Soboleff. acting on direct orders from the Czar, called on the Prince and refused to take his dismissal. This the Russian followed up by pre- senting an ultimatum, the principal terms of which were the demission #f his full powers by the Prince, the practical dictatorship of the Russian generals, and the convocation of a Constituent Assembly under their auspices to draw up a new Constitution.i After contemplating abdication and vainly appealing to the Powers, the Prince has finally decided to yield, and has privatelv signed a manifesto embodying the Russian conditions. The publication of the manifesto is. however, deferred till the Prince’s fSte day, a week hence. In spite of this concession, the tension is such that the abdication of the Prince seems to be inevitable.

France, Cm*a, emd Ahnam.— MongJumg, Sept. 14 (Times). —The Frentih, having moved forward* irom Hanoi, encountered and defeated the Macfc Flags. The rifles of the latter are reported to bear the Chinese Arsenal mark. The Chinese press has adopted a belli- g. ivnt tone towards the Frencfh, and declares the Treaty of Hut to be contrary to international law. Cailton is at r-i esent quiet. .... I'AKls Sept. 14.—The Havas Agency publishes a note, according to which at to day's Cabinet Council, M. Chal- hmel lacour stated that ""the negotiations with China were progressing favourably."" "" The most perfect accord, continues the note, "" has throughout prevailed in the cabinet, both as regards the necessity of sending rein- foTcements to Tonquin and as regards the policy to 1)0 pursued. This policy, which has received the unanimous approval of the Cabinet, has a conciliatory character."" Hongkonc, Sept. 14 (New York Herald).— "" The American Consul at Canton considers there is no need of further anxiety about the foreign residents of that city. Crowds are frequently seen on the river front, but the presence of gunboats and troops prevents further out- breaks. "" The following despatch has also been received ht the London oflSce of the New York Herald from its special correspondent in Hongkong : —"" My correspon- dent at Haiphong sends me from French official sources iurther information concerning the second attack of the French upon the Black Flags. Previous accounts sent, which were derived from Annanvite sources, claimed the victory for the Black Flags. The following is a correct account: —On the Ist of September the French advanced within 12 miles of Hontay, to a"" village called Pallan. Tliere they found the enemy in casemated forts, on which the gunboats had no effect. After three days' hard fight- ing the works were carried at the point of the bayonet. '1 lie French lost in killed 14 men and two officers; in wounded 40 men and three officers. The Yellow Flags— Ihi C hinese auxiliaries—lost six killed and two wounded. The losses of the lilack Flags were over 500 killed. The French captured two guns, two standards, and one chief's l>attle flag. General Bouet retired to Hanoi to await reinforcements, leaving 300 men to hold the cap- lured towns."" Paris, Sept. 15.—The official report of General l'ouut, received by the Minister of Marine, supplies the following fresh details of the recent fighting near Hontay: The losses of tlio enemy are estimated at 1000. Two Hags and a quantity of arms were taken. The French liold the positions captured. The losses of the French were two officers and 14 men killed, and three officers Mid 35 men wounded. The enemy's position was HHsaulted at the point of the bayonet, the troops being in the water up to their breasts. The strength of the enemy was 4000. The enemy expected reinforcements from Sontay, but the French gunboats prevented them liom arriving. The Minister of Marine has received a telegram announcing that five companies of French troops, aided l y the Yellow Hags and three companies of Annamitc troops, carried the fortified position of Pay on the Ist inst., and on the 3d inst. established a fortified post at Palan. In the lighting dur'ng these operations the French lost 54 killed and wounded and the enemy lt'Ot). Paris, Sept. 10.—The Minister for the Navy has received the following official despatch from Hanoi, under date the 14th in®?. :—"" After the affair of the 15th of August, and notwithstanding the inundation, five com- panies of Marines, three of Annamite riflemen, a batiery, and two gunboats ascended the lied Biver towards fSc.ng Tai, under the command of General Bouet. The right w ing was supported by a body of Yellow Flag auxiliaries. I>n the Ist of .September the fortified position of Day «\as attacked and taken. After a severe struggle a tayonet charge was necessary. Our troops were up to Iheir chests in water, but showed remarkable >'lan. The enemy, numbering 4000, were everywhere dispersed, hnd the tire of our gunboats greatly retarded the arrival of their reinforcements from Song Tai. On the 3d inst. we established a fortified position at T'alan, at the spot where the Day joins the main stream. The enemy's losses are 1000 men. Three flags and a quantity of arms were captured, and the hostile positions are retained by onr troops. Uur losses were two officers and 14 men killed, and three officers and 35 men wounded, 20 of them slightly. Cur auxiliaries suffered proportionately. ' The French Ambassador and Chinese Minister bad two interviews with Lord Granville at Walmtr Castle last week, and at the second interview they met This is an indication of the fact that the Foreign Secretary has been using his good ofiices, and to gooii j.urpu-e, in the very delicate and perplexing questions at issue between Pekin and Tai is. That Lord Granville's friendly influence has been feit and appreciated in Tar is is suf- ficiently manifest from the cordial expressions < f the French Prime Minister in his conversation with the cor- respondent of the Daily News. That the English Minister's services have been received in the spirit in which they were offered is in itself a good omen. It would be unwarrantable to despair of a frit ndly settle- ment of the Franco-Chinese dispute, now that the two Envoys have discussed the question together, in presence of a third Minister, in whose friendliness, good sense, and impartiality, they both have entire confidence Hongkong, Sept. 17 (New York Herald). —General Bouet arrived here to-day from Tonquin, accompanied by M. llarmand, the French Commissioner. His position has been assumed by Colonel Bichut, Colonel Baden's Chief of Staff. Haiphong is said to be General lionet's place of assignment, though it has been assumed that he has been in reality removed from active command by the Commissioner-General. The conflict between the civil and military powers is daily assuming greater proportions. The Black Hags are resuming positions now within live miles of the citadel of Hanoi. At Palan, the fortified place which General Bouet succeeded in taking recently after stubborn resistance, the French have a small force of 120 men and two gunboats, iu which they can retire if necessary. Their position, however, is very critical. The Black Flags swarm upon the French outposts, which will soon have to be withdrawn until reinforcements arrive. The river traffic is almost entirely stopjted by pirates. Paris, Sept. 17.—The Marquis Tseng arrived in Paris this evening. The contract announced a short time ago for the construction by an English firm of several river gunboats for the French Government, the Havas Agency states, ""will not be made, it having been impossible to close the bargain."" M. Jules Ferry had an inter view to-day of an hour and a half's duration with M. Waddington, who it axe an account of his conversation at IVaimer Castle with Lord Uranville and the Marquis Tseng. The Lilfrte, the organ of the Pereires, while expressing doubts whether the absence of M. Challemel-Lacour at this moment can be attributable to indisposition, says :—"" We bail the choice of M. Jules Ferry to replace him as a proof of the pacific spirit in which our diplomatic action with China will be conducted. We believe, despite all the rumours to the contrary that are circulated, that the President of the Council is thoroughly convinced of the considerable danger we should run, not only in regard to onr policy in the extreme East, but in our relations with Europe by a war with China. Although we have often differed with him on the subject of the system of colonial extension in which we see many perils without compensation, we entertain a efficiently high opinion of his patriotism not to suspect him of being capable, with a light heart, of plunging us into adventures the gravity and consequences of which are immeasurable. We are therefore convinced that M. Ferry will do everything hononrably possible to terminate this unfortunate affair pacifically. He is now beyond all doubt aided by the good wishes and assistance of England. The rapid journeys of M. Waddington between London and Parle attest the activity of the relations between the two Cabinets. China, too, seems more conciliatory, if M. Ferry can happily terminate this long and delicate negotiation, and relieve us from the embarrassment caused by the Tonquin expedition, and re-establish at once good relations with China and friendship with Eng- land, he will have accomplished a work for which the country will feel grateful, and will strengthen bis posi- tion in the Chambers. Madagascar.—The ultimatum submitted by Admiral Pierre to the new Queen of Madagascar, liana- valona 111., lias been shown to the correspondent of the Daily Ne\ ct, now at Antananarivo. It 1b of the most peremptory character. The French Republic demands that the Queen shall recognise its sovereignty over all districts ceded to it by the Sakalavas, which cover a sixth of the island and have a coast-line of 240 miles; that the laws prohibiting French purchases in Mada- gascar shall be repealed; and that the Queen shall, within 15 days, send a Plenipotentiary to such place as the Commissary df the Republic shall appoint, with powers ""to make any alterations in the Treaty of 18t>8 that the Commissary may propose to him."" Moreover, the Malagasy Government shall, within 30 days, pay an indemnity to the Republic of 40,000;. The Prime Minister, who is just now Mayor of the Palace, and mar- rits each successive Queen, has replied that Madagascar will not negotiate at all, uuless the sovereignty of the Queen is recognised over the whole island. The French, therefore, occupy Tamatave, and the Hovas besiege them, and that will last until the Ministry at War can spare troops for an advance upon the capital. Calcutta, Sept. 18 (Timet).—Startling news from Taiuatave reaches me. On good authority, lam assured that the published story of outrages falls far short of the truth. When Consul Pakenham was dying French priests strove to force their faith on him, and compelled him to kiss the crucifix. My informant declares that Admiral Pierre was in a mental condition which rendered him an irresponsible agent. These facts have been, I believe, communicated to the home authorities. Fka^ce. —Decrees were on Tuesday published in the Journal OJidel placing 21 Presidents and 75 Judges of Appeal Courts, two Advocates-General, and eight Presidents, two and ten Judges of Tribunals of First Instance on the retinal list, and ap- pointing their successors. ' The Sorth German Gazette, which recently created a '' scare "" by a solemn admonitiou to France, now adroitly turns round and warns the Times that it will not succeed in stirring up bad feeling between Paris and Berlin. The Gazette innocently disclaims the ""attitude of menace"" whioh the Time* had attributed to it, and suggests that the calculations of the English journal may perhaps be upset by a Franco-German ' 4 understanding."" Germans ""wish France every success in the world,"" says the jdwtte, if ""she will take her stand on existing treaties.' Holland.—The Hague, Sept. 17. —The States-General were opened to-day by the King, who in bis speech from the Throne stated that the relations of Holland with foreign States were very friendly. Alluding to the war in Atchin, his said that serious efforts were still required to effect the complete pacification of i.he country, and eulogized the military forces for the gallant manner in which they were doing their duty. Revolts had been repressed at other points of the Dutch East Indies. Those colonies had sustained several calamities, the last being the unpreoedentedly disastrous uption of Krakatoa. Adverting to hone affairs, his -Majesty stated that proposals for the indispensable augmentation of the public revenue and the introduction a penal code would be submitted to the Legislature. J'he question of the revision of the Constitution was still being discussed by the Royal Commission appointed to examine it. Italy. — A monument to King Victor i mmanuel was inaugurated at Lodi on Sunday in the Kesence of his Mqjosty King Humbert, the civil and military authorities, and a large crowd of people.

Vi (Tiaus). —Reports from Zululand are bo liable to be contradicted thai I from sendiag any of the changeable stories which ift published daily here. Respectable European residents from Zuluhmd, however, confirm til previous accounts regarding the absolute absence of law and authority ; outside the Reserve and territory murder goes unpunfohed, and cattle lifting is licensed sport. Cetewayo's purposes are buried in his own breast. Having despoiled Bomkele, Vsibepu appears to wait events in his own territory.' Europeans with him con- flrm the favourable accounts of his character. Mr. Francis E. Cotenso has sent the following account which he has just received from Bishopstowe, Natal, of the attack made by Usibepu upon CeCewayo : —"" Kukula, who reached Bishopstowe in the evening of August 6, states I am sent by Shingana, Mabanana, Qetuka, Sigananda, and Melelesi, by the order of Cetewayo, to say that he is alive, and that he asks that this matter may be inquired into, since this destruction has come upon him in his own home, in consequence of his "" sitting still"" according to his promise. 1 have not seen the King myself ; he was in the Bush country, near Ulundi, but did not mean to stay there. He has two assegai wounds in the thigh, neither of them serious, and he sent Baleni, an innceku, to tell the chiefs to send down this message, and also to let Mnyamana know that he (the King) is alive.' Nomahobodiya reached Bishopstowe on Aug. 4. He was one of those who brought down the King's letter of July 16 and had hurried back to Zululand to learn the truth on the first reports of the surprise at Ulundi. He and Kukula state as follows: —'No impi had gone out from Ulundi; there were portions of nine regiments there, but two of them only in name, as their companies were not filled up yet. The King had intended to send three or four regiments to Mnyamana's assistance, on hearing that Usibepu's party had sent an impi into the King's territory to support Hamu in his rebellion. But when these regiments had been prepared and were ready to start, they were stopped by Mr. Fynn, who came to the King and said, ""You arc forbidden by the conditions to send out any impi. Have nothing to do with Mnya- mana. Do you just remain quietly at home, and let the enemy come and attack you here in your own place, that it may be plain that you are not responsible for the fight- ing."" So the King gave way, which greatly disheartened the men, for the impi was broken up—that is, the men were not kept in fighting array, but were set to work in- stead in cutting wood for the building of the kraal, &c. But it was always the same. Whenever a party was sent out whether to cut wood, or to burn the grass, or hunt- ing, or scouting—since Usibepu's party had threatened to attack Ulundi itself —Mr. Fynn would come and say that they must go back, as he was sure that they were going against Usibepu's party ; and so it came to pass that this impi was first seen, spreading itself out to surround the kraal, one portion about a mile off, another a very little further in another direction. The sun was just up (? about 715 a.m.) and large parties of men were away, some of them gone to their wood-cutting, some to the river to wash, others to fetch water, some were escorting home the parties of girls who had come bringing food to the Royal kraal, while those who remained were not kept in any particular order, the impi having been broken up ; while the kraal was full of women, too, who had come both from the King's territory and the Reserve, and were preparing the thatch for the huts. The alarm was given by one of our own people, and just then Makahleleka, the Swazi prince, rode up, for the enemy had passed by the kraal where he was lodging, and he had hastened to warn the King. Our meu rushed out to meet the enemy, not as an impi in lighting array, but just as working people hurrying from their work and all abroad. There wan no time even to marshal those who were there So the enemy with their horses soon scattered them, and reached the kraal and burnt it, killing chiefs and old men, women and children, the (uNdhlunkulu) Royal female attendants, andnumbers of the working women, killing (some of) the King's own wives and children. The dead bodies of three of his wives and of three of his father's wives have been found, some of them four or live miles from Ulundi, and the dead body, too, of bis little son Nyoniyentaba (six years old), whose mother, too, is wounded by the same assegai which stabbed her child to death in her arms. Many people who had not time to get out they burnt to death in the huts, and destroyed or carried off the King's property, even the presents which had been given to him in England. How the King was saved we know from Baleni, who was told by the King himself and the girls who were with him. Mr. F. W.C'hesson writes as follows in Monday's Times from the Aborigines' Protection Society's chambers : — ""In the early part of Jidy Usibepu despatched ten companies of troops to assist Hamu in his rebellion against Cetewayo, a rebellion which the latter would have had no difficulty in suppressing if he had been allowed to enforce his authority. Mr. Fynn, however, in accordance, no doubt, with his instructiuns, warned Cetewayo that if he organized a military force, or resorted to hostilities, he would be guilty of violating the conditions imposed upon him at his restoration. Probably Sir Henry Bulwer trusted to his being able to induce Usibepu to remain quiet, but his messengers appear to have been unable to communicate directly with that chief, who, moreover, had no Resident with him. At any rate, ture is good reason to believe that the surprise and defeat of Cetewayo are mainly due to bis having been forbidden, at the critical moment, to act in self-defence."" The lHi.ly Sews learns that the first intelligence of the safety of Cetewayo was communicated to the Natal Government by a messenger from the King named Kukula. He told Mr. John Shepstone that Cetewayo demanded that the matter of hia surprise and attack by Zibebu, as well as the slaughter of his people should be inquired into, "" because Zibebu's party would never have attempted this thing if they had not been backed up."" Milwana, another messenger from the King, arrived at Bishopstowe on August 10. He stated that Mnyamana and N'dabuko were coming to Cetewayo with the main army and tlie Abaqulusi division, adding:—"" Jhe King is sending messengers to the Governor, to Mr. Fyun, and to Mr. Osborn to report this attack on him and massacre of his people and of his own family, and to claim that his brother Siteku and others who have been taken captive be recovered for him, since this has happened through his being forbidden to protect himself and bis own people."" In the lh-st reports of the attack on Ulundi it was stated that Cetewayo's son was killed. A correspondent of the Daily Scwe at Durban, whose letter is dated Aug. 12, thus explains what occurred:—""Dinazulu, the Kin«'s son, escaped. His second son was only four years old, and was on his mother's back when she made ber escape from Ulundi. The poor creature was over- taken by Zibebu's men, and the child was stabbed to death on her back, the assegais penetrating the mother, who, when I heard, was still alive. Din&zulu is there- fore the King s only son."" Cape Town, Aug. 28.—Cetewayo is stated to have been visited in the lnkamhla Bush by Transvaal Boers, who have taken his sons to Utrecht for safety. Cete- wayo's people are swarming to him. Mayamana and Undabuko with a large impi are concentrating in Cete- wayo's neighbourhood. Some companies of the Welsh Regiment, under the command of Lieut.-Col. Montgomery, have been ordered to Fort Pearson on the Tugela as a corps of observation and for the protection of the Natal border. Cetewayo is practically taking possession of the Reserve Territory. Advices from Basutoland show that a large majority of the Basutos are now decidedly in favour of the resumption of the Imperial role. Masupha's people are dissatisfied, and are trekking to the Orange Free State and elsewhere. Captain Blyth's popularity is rapidly increasing, and the Basutos express regret that he was not sent to them before. Durban, Kept. 17 (Heuter). —A detachment of artillery, with a large convoy of ammunition and a squadron of dragoons, have been ordered to proceed immediately to Etshowe. The object of the expedition is believed to be to make a demonstration in the Reserve Territory. Pabulamami. Cetewayo's brother, who was recently arrested at Greytown, while coming from laaadola with- out a pass, has been reprimanded and sent back to Zulu- land under escort. Durban, Sept. 18.—The Usutns have attacked Oharn. The result is unknown. A statement that Sir Henry Bulwer has sent an ultimatum to Cetewayo demanding that he should within 10 days sui render himself to Mr. Osborn is incorrect and unfounded. Ashaxtee.—Cape Coast Castle, August 31.— Intelligence received here from Coomassie announces that Koffee Kalc&lli has been defeated and compelled to retreat from the Ashantee capital. He ia reported to have fled in the direction of Gaman. Great slaughter was made among his partisans. Egypt.—The contracts for provisions for the army of occupation have been renewed for six months, and the telephone contract for 12 months. The cholera has almost disappeared except in the villages of Assiout and Keneh, in Upper Egypt, and a few cases in Alex- andria. Alexandria is now without an English man-of- war in the harbour. The Condor left this morning for Malta. The general reports of the cotton crop are favourable. Alexandria, Sept. 17.—Two of the members of the Mustapnezeen corps, condemned to death for participa- tion in the massacres in this city, were banged this morning. The third man had the capital sentence com- muted to penal servitude for life. Bulgaria.—Sofia, Sept. 16. —The extra- ordinary session of the Bulgarian National Assembly was opened to-day by Prince Alexander. In his speech from the throne, his Highness, after adverting to the proofs of paAriotiam and devotion to his person shown by the deputies during the last session of the Assembly, uud bidding them welcome on the occasion of their resuming their labours, 'said he had convoked them to examine and ratify the Convention signed by the Con- ference k Quatre providing for the union of the Turco- •Servian railways in conformity with the stipulations of the Treaty of Berlin. Be recommended the Assembly to give the matter its earnest consideration in order to prove that Bulgaria did not shrink from the performance of the duties imposed on her by international treaties. The Prince further announced that a Convention bad been concluded with Russia with regard to the cost* of the Russian occupation of the Principality subsequent to the last war, the charges for whiqh devolved upon Bulgaria under the Berlin Treaty. Prince Alexander concluded his speech with the following words: —*'lavail myself eagerly of this opportunity to assure my beloved people that my sole aim is, and always will be, to promote the greatness and independence of Bulgaria and the happiness of my subject?."" Switzerland. —Miss Booth has been put in prison at Neuchatel for attending a religious meeting, and ""Colonel"" Clibborn has been expelled from the canton of Geneva for singing a hymn at a funeral. The Constitution of the country in which these things hate come to pass guarantees to every citizen the fullest religious freedom, and a treaty between England and Switzerland places subjects of the Queen on the same footing in every respect as natives of the country, hat even the Geneva Council of State would not dare to punish a Swiss citizen for singing a hymn. India.—A Beuter's telegram from Simla states that, in addition to limiting the jurisdiction under the Bill to district, magistrates and SMrimu judges, it if proposed to modify the Ilbert Bill so as to allow Euro- pean cases to be transferred to the high oourt# when their transfer is regarded as expedient, and likely to further the ends of justice. The Marquia of Lome and the Princess Louise will probably leave Canada at the end of October, when it is thought that the Marquis of Lansdowne will arrive and take over the dwttos of Governor-General. Six women employed in field labour have been killed by lightning at Kolen, in Bohemia, white standing for shelter under a large tree during a thunder- storm.

The Luther festival (the 400 th anniversary) was opened on the 13th by the German Crown Prince, The visitors to the town were estimated at 50,000, and over 1000 clergymen were present, including deputations from England, France, Russia, and Hungary. The Princes attended service, and afterwards went to the Castle church, where the Crown Prince placed a laurel wreath upon Luther's grave. At the subsequent opening of the Luther Hall his Imperial Highness made a speech, in which he .said: —May this festival serve as a holy exhortation to us to uphold the great benefits of the Reformation with the same courage as was displayed in acquiring them for us. May it above all strengthen ns in the resolution to be ready at all times to defend the Evangelical creed, and with it liberty of conscience and religious toleration. The strength and essence of Pro- testantism do not rest upon any stiff form of written words, but in the striving after the knowledge of Christian truth. May Luther's anniversary help to strengthen Protestant feeling, preserve the German Evangelical Church from disunion, and lay for her the foundation of lasting peace. A curious attempt at blackmailing was some time ago reported from New Haven, Connecticut. A young man named Isaac Lockwood, who had been ajeweller in New York, contrived, while living in a retired village in Con- necticut, the following ingenious scheme for making him- self rich at the expense of the dishonest among his fellow* creatures: —He sent out to every banking-house in the State, and to many in England, copies of a circular set- ting forth that the writer was in a position to afford sub- stantial assistance towards putting themselves right to cashiers or bank clerks who would confess to him frankly that they had embezzled the money of their employers and promise to reform for the future. The circular ex- plained that a retired banker had lately died leaving nearly 800,000 dollars, which he wished to be devoted to the purpose just indicated. His reason for giving such a singular direction with regard to the disposal of his wealth was that, when a young man, he had used for his own purposes 80,000 dollars out of the funds of a bank with which he was then connected, and had been rescued from ruin by a benevolent old gentleman who bad con- sented to make his defalcations good, on condition that he promised to abstain from bad ways in future, and, if he should ever be rich, to spend as much money as that advanced to him in saving some others from dishonour. Unfortunately, the young man thus rescued grew old without ever discovering a fitting subject for his charity, and now an ""old and tried friend"" of his was endeavour- ing, by issuing this circular, to carry out his dying wishes. This was Mr. Isaac Lockwood's bait. It is stated that "" scores of men gulped it down,"" until tbo rascal was in possession of a long list of confessions of dishonesty from the States, and, it seems, several from England. Lock- wood was soon detected, and has been sentenced to a year's hard labour. Princess Victoria.—The Standard's Berlin correspondent is informed that the marriage of Princess Victoria of Hesse to Prince Louis of Battenberg will take place, not in the autumn at Windsor, but next February at Darmstadt. Lord Coleridge in America. —A brilliant public reeeption was given to Lord Coleridge at the Casino, Newport, on Thursday. A Daily News telegram says: — ""The reception committee comprised over a hundred of the most eminent summer residents, including Mr. John Jacob Astor, the two Vanderbilt3, and distin- guished lawyers, judges, artists, and merchants from all parts of the country. The Casino was handsomely deco- rated with the English and American flags and tropical plants. An address engrossed on vellum was read by Judgo Blatchford, of the Supreme Court of the United States, cordially welcoming the Lord Chief Justice of England to this country. Lord Coleridge, in replying, said that the great position he had the honour to occupy came to him solely by the long-continued, though un- deserved, good opinion of one man whom he had ever recognized as his political leader—the great and illus- trious person who now fills the office of Prime Minister of England. The speech was informal, and consisted mainly of playful allusions ",English,General of the Week.

In the evening Judge Blatchford gave a banquet to Lord Coleridge at the Casino, at which many distinguished persons were present."" Singular Wtdding.—The marriage of Carl Bossbard and Elise Clay Hastings is a romance. Four years ago a Swiss colony was established near Atalanta, among whom was the single young man Bosshard. Hav- ing thriven, he sent for his sweetheart in Switzerland. She was met by her lover. She could not speak a word of English, and no preacher in the town understood the language. In this dilemma the Rev, Dr. Jones appointed the groom interpreter, and by this means the questions were put and answered. The marriage took place in Dr. Jones's parlour, and was witnessed by a large number of ladies, who expressed their sympathy for the bride by the natural language of kisses.",English,General of the Week.
1883-10-09,0000321- Nottingham Evening Post,krakatau,1,"THE VOLCANIC ERUPTION IN JAVA. Further Dotalli. Lloyd's agent at Batavia, under cato Ist Sep- tember, writes as follows: —Tho past week is memorable as having witnessed one of the mcst disastrous and severe volcanic eruptions ever known in the Malay archipelago. Krakatau has again beeu the origin of the disturbance. On Sunday last, about 4 p.m., a series of detonations were heard, proceeding apparently from the south- west. Towards night these grew louder, till in the earJy morning the reports and concussions were simply deafening, not to say alarming. When day broke the atmosphere to the west had a sulphurous and lurid appearance, and a tain layer of fin 9 white ash covered the ground. Towards 0 a.m. tbe reports died away, but about an hour later dark clouds quite obscured the sky and the sun. A heavy rain of ashes, sulphur, aud dust commenced to fall, and r.t 11 a.m. this town was in pitch darkness, and business totally sus- pended. About twelve o'clock mid-day a large wave about l?ft. in height swept in from the sea, causing many prows and small craft to be driven ashore, but tioing but little damage to the shipping in the harbour. This being the dry monsoon, the rivers aro low at present. The wave, however, drove an immense volume of water up our river-, which suddenly ro.-e so high that the banks at the river mouth were flooded ana many small crafts stranded. Happily the wave subsided again suddenly, leaving the river almost dry, and about one o'clock the rain of ashes subsided and the atmospnere grew lighter. Shortly after two p.m., however, another wave, larger than the first, came rolling in from the sea. A few native fishermen were drowned by this wave, and two Europeans at Onrust also lost their lives. At Tamijong Prisk the Princess Wilhelmina was within an ace of stranding, while small ciatt and prows wen; cast high upon lana. No further damage, however, occurred In Batavia. The eruption, however, so far as wefean learn, has had most fatal and disastrous effects all along the south-west coast of Java, and also on the south-coast of Sumatra. We shall not probably be in possession of full par- ticulars for some days yet, as telegraph lines are damaged and roads destroyed, but so far as we can give the following particulara:—""The island of Krakatau, the summit of which peak was 2,600 ft. above water level, has totally disappeared below the sea, and the neighbouring island of Dwaisindetog is split in five parts, Sixteen new volcanic islands have been formed between Krakatau and Gibesie, and the sea bottom in tiie Straits of Sunda has completely changed; in fact, the Admiral Commanding-in-chief has issued a circular stating that till new soundings have been taken the navigation of the Straits of Sund a is likely to b* ex- tremely dangerous. Anjer and lighthouse, and the other lights of south-west Java, have; all been destroyed. The subsidences and upheavals we have alluded to caused a large wave, about lOOit. iv height, to sweep down ou the south-west coast of Java and south of Sumatra. This wave swept inland for sr great distance, thereby doing great injury both to life and to prop.uty, Wo are here only twelve miles away from one of the points on which the w.ive spent its fury. The whole coast line to the south-west has changed its configuration The in- habitants of tho island Onrust were only saved from the flood which swept over the island by taking refuge ou board two steamers. At Moral; < Government establish- ment) the inhabitants took refuge on the knoll oOft, high, but were all swept off and drowned, with the exception of one European and two Malays, who were saved. Mauk and Kramat, west side of Batavia Roads, have been laid waste, and about 309 lives lost. In Terengin only one house has been left standing. Both the native and European officials have perished. A rain of mud also fell at the above-named place, which is situated opposite to where Krakatau Islftnd ouce lay. Anjer seems to have been completely destroyed. Lloyd's sub-agent there wires from S rang :—"" All gone ; plenty lives lost."" The dry dock at Amsterdam Island was carried away by the waves, bnt bas since been found stranded in Middleburg Island. ThePadang,steamer,which left here on Sunday, returned next day to Anjer, only to find the place in ruins. The captain reports that his vessels was in great danger owing to the eruption from Krakatau. On his arrival at Selok: Betong, his first port of call, the plac ; was found completely destroyed. We understand that it has been submerged, but are not yet in possession of ful particulars. We hear that on Monday tho whole of West Java as far as Banding was shrouded in darkness and covered by ash rain. A tele- gram just informs us that tho explosions from Krakatau were heard at Deli (Sumatra), which place is opposite Penang. The Government here, we understand, in the interest of shipping, are send- ing out steamers to cud of the Straits of Honda to warn vessels to observe extreme caution while passing the Straits of Sunda, as charts are no longer trustworthy. According to the latest telegrams from Sevang we learn that on the ncedence of Zirengen 10,000 hves are calculated to be lost. The Padan, steamer, just iv, reports that it is impossible to ap- proach to the place where Selok Betong once was situated, owing to the sea fiiled with pumicestone and rand.

There are numbers of desertions among the Black Flags, who are being thinned by several epidemics. The intrenuhments of the villages in the neighbourhood of Hanoi have been deserted, and the enemy seems to bo retreating in the direction of Laokai. Colonel Bichot met with no enemy in his reconnoissance as far as Day and the Ca»al of the Rapids. Near Phukai were found, under a mound, 33 heads of our soldiers, of which that of Cammander Rivtere, covered with a coating of lime, is alone easily recognized. The moral and sanitary condition of the troops at Tonquin and Thuanan is excellent."" —Another telegram to the Government further announces that Hontay is partly evacuated. France and Spain. —The untoward incident attending the arrival of King Alphonao in Paris has not only led to explanations on the part of the French (iovernment to the Spanish Ministers, but it lias led to the resignation of M. Thibaudin, French Minister of War, who is believed to have abstained from being present at the reception of Alphonso on account of his Republican principles. The Paris correspondent of the Tunes says M. Ferry asserted his doe prerogative as Prime Minister by insisting on General Thibaudin's resignation. At a Cabinet Council the Ueneral's sham illness during King Alphonso's visit was sharply criticized, but he defended himself, complained that he had ail along been cold- shouldered by his colleagues, and declared his readiness to justify himself before the Chamber. After a confer- ence with several members of the Cabinet, M Ferry waited on the President to inform him that General Thibaudin's resignation was the only way of avoiding a Ministerial crisis, which just now wonld be very pre- judicial to foreign relations. The President reluctantly agreed to part with the Minister of War, and M. Ferry next called on the General to solicit his resignation. The Ueneral decliued to give this, unless at the express instance of the President, and he repaired to the Elyst e, where he found there was no help for it. Thereupon he drew up a letter of a resignation to the President. Paris, Oct. 6 (Reuter). —The moderate Republican and Monarchist journals to-day express satisfaction at the resignation of General Thibauiiin. The Htpubli-juc Franca it e declares that his maintenance in office would have rendered all regular relations with neighbouring countries impossible. The Paix would have preferred the step to have been taken less unexpectedly. The Oaului. says : —""General Thibaudin, as Minister of War, was dangerous to peace generally."" The Voltaire denies that the Minister's resignation was owing to the demand uf Spain. The Irreconeileable journals violently attack the Ministry, and express the hope that General Thibaudin's retirement from the Cabinet will be of short duration. France.—The final statistics uf the last census, just published, show that there were no fewer than 1,001,01)0 foreigners in France in 18H1— that is, 2 68 per cent, of tbe total population ot tbe country. Uf these 37,000 were English. The French Ministry of War lias been filled up by the appointment of General Catnpenon, who served under M. (jambetta as Minister of War. Madame Sarah Bernhardt'* unfortunate marriage is again exciting tbe curiosity of the scandal-loving Parisians. Two journals of second rate reputation a few •lays ago driigged the subject out of oblivion on the plea of defending Madame Bernhardt's. husband, M. Dauiaia. !he defence of this gentleman, who has just accepted an engagement at the tiyutnasc Theatre, was coupled with tome not very complimentary remarks on the great sctiess and her seat. M. Maurice Bernhardt, a young man scarcely out of his teens, though precocious enough to be the lessee of a theatre, scut his seconds to the editors of tbe offending papers. Both declined to do battle with so young a man, but the result has been the publication of several enigmatical letters, which were never intended for publication, and an interview, in which Madame Bernhardt has explained iuiidelity and extravagance to be the cause of her separation from her husband. Egyit.—The Soudan Expedition.—The special correspondent of the Daily yew*, writing from the Entrenched Camp, 30 miles S.W. Dueui, Sept. 30, says before leaving Khartoum it was decided to establish a line of fortiticd posts in order lo maintain communication with our base on the Nile. In consequence of the (loveraor-General's report of the number of Arab tribes which return on our line of march after we pass, and the difficulty of inducing small bodies of troops to escort stores between the posts this plan has been abandoned. Consequently the anny is cut off from its base of opera- tions, and must depend for 60 days on biscuits and what san be captured hereafter. The army is advancing as rapidly as possible to Obeid in order to press on a decisive action, on which everything depend*. The heat is in- tense. The camels are daily dying iu considerable num- bers, but we hope to be able to carry all the biscuits to Die end; otherwise, ami if grain be not captured, retreat to tbe Nile would be necessary. The enemy, 12,000 strong, are reported to be close by. An official bulletin states that no death from cholera occurred throughout the whole of Egypt for three days. CAIRO, Oct. 9.—lt is expected that the Khedive will ssae a decree on the occasion of the Courban Bahrain Festival a few days hence, granting an amnesty for all crimes connected with the late insurrection except mur- der and outrages on women. Turkey.—Constantinople, October s.—Lord Duff coin's audience with the Sultan yesterday was of a very cordial character. Nothing authentic has transpired in regard to what passed; but it is affirmed that the interview, which lasted nearly two hours, served to con- tribute to tbe consolidation of the friendly relations sub- liritiag between England and Turkey, and to guarantee the maintenance of peace. The British Ambassador addreased a Note yesterday to the Porte, asking to be enlightened with regard to the meaning of some expres- sions in the last Note of the Turkish Government on the subject of the commercial tariff, and requesting tbe Porte to make known what position British commerce would occupy during the interval which must elapse until the uew treaty comes into force. Lord Dufferin is said to have verbally declared that England accepts the 8 per cent, ad valorem Customs duty, but desires a declaration from the Porte that this duty will be permanent until the new tieaty is concluded. Switzerland.—A public meeting was held at Neufcbatel on October 7, at which a resolution was adopted demanding the expulsion of tbe English members »f tbe Salvation Army. A Councillor of State who was »resent declared that tbe body to which he belonged vould do its duty and close the gates of Switzerland to hose who traded on her hospitality. The meeting, vhich was attended by 2000 persons, passed off in an trderly manner. The ""rabbit plague"" in Australia can stayed, it is proposed by Mr. Willows, M.8.C.V.5.1. inoculating some of the pests with tuberculous m:.. in the hope of driving them into a "" decline."" A strange and fatal accident is reported from the Central Provinces of India. Doctor Jackson, civil surgeon of Pachmarree, while out tiger shooting with a friend waa attacked by hornets and received over 200 stings. Erysipelas set in and proved fatal. His friend was saved by tbe presence of mind of his servant, who dragged him into the jnngle, but not before he had been atung severely. In his case, however, no evil conse- quences followed. Advices received at Plymouth from Yoko- hama, dated August 28, announce that a lire, resulting in great loss of life, occurred in a theatre at Katamoto- inura Kamuda, Govi Sonuki. The building was filled with people during a performance, and being of highly inflammable construction the fhuues spread with awful rapidity, and in a few minutes enveloped the theatre. In an instant after the alarm there was confusion, and desperate attempts were made to get out of the theatre. In tbe result 15 adults and 60 children were found to have been killed, and over 100 persons were seriously injured. French Ayyressiamon the Congo.—lntelligence from the Congo, brought to Madeira by the steamer Mandingo, reports that the French have taken possession A El Obey Point, where they are establishing factories and distributing flags to the natives. Tbe situation is regarded as very unsatisfactory by the resident traders, who fear that they will be driven- away. It is added that the French commandant at Gaboon is pursuing a course of action which apparently aims at the expulsion of the English and Gorman traders. Tbe French contem- plate establishing a factory at Old Calabar, and have had a grand palaver with the King, who is In their favour. The Volcanic Eruption in Java.—Lloyd's agent at Batavia says tbe island of Krakatau, the summit of which peak was 1800 feet above water level, has totally disappeared below the sea, and the neighbouring island of Dwaisindetoag is split in five parts. Sixteen new volcanic islands have bean formed between Krakatau and Gibesie, and the aea bottom in the Straits of Sunda baa completely changed; in fart, the Admiral Commanding- in-Chief has issued a circular stating that till soundings have been taken the navigation of the Straits of Sunda is likely to be uti—ily dangerous. Anger and lighthouse and the other lights of South-weat Java have all been destroyed. Tbe sabeWlences and upheavals we have alluded to caused a knee wane, about 100 Cart in height, to sweep down on the south-west ooast of Java and aooth of Sumatra. This wave swept inland for a great dlstawßi, thereby doing great injury both to life and to property.

1883-10-29,0000452- Edinburgh Evening News,krakatoa,1,"THE VOLCANIC ERUPTION IN JAVA. NARRATIVE OF A SURVIVOR. Lloyd's agent at Batavia, writing under date the 15th of September, says : ""Since the departure jof the last mail we have had a visit from Mr Schint, our late subat Anjer, who was fortunate in escaping from the abovo place with his lffe, though all his pro- | i»erty was completely destroyed. Mr Scnint ' has given the following details of the des- truction of Anjer: *On Sunday, the 36th ult., loud j reports and detonations were heard from the direc- tion of Krakatoa, and towards evening the sea I became unusually agitated, the water assuming a | colour offciky blackness. No apprehensions, how- ever, were entertained for the safety of the town, and nothing occurred during the night. At 6 a.m, next morning Mr Schint went dowu to the beach to look after the mooring of his boats. While en- gaged in this work an immense wave, about 83 metres (37 feet) high, swept without the slightest warning over Anjer. completely ruining the place and jK-netrating inland to the distance of about two miles. Mr Schint only saved his life by lump- ing into one of his boats, which was close hand; seven of his family, however, were among the victims of the flood. The few survivors made their way as best they could inland ; but, to add to the horrors of the scene, the atmosphere grew pitch dark, and boiling mud fell in showers. At about 10 a.m. a second wave, supposed to be higher than the fip*t, (though its height could not be esti- mated, owing to the darkness), again swept over the place. By this time, however, most of the sur- vivors from the first wave had gone inland. The coast of Java, from Maook on tno north to Java's third point on tho south-west, has completely changed in configuration, the sea having encoached to the distance of half a mile inland. Thousands of cocoa-nut palms have been destroyed, and banyan trees 200 years old have been completely uprooted and swept away ; large masses of coral, weighing 400 to 500 picols each, have been carried four miles inland ; and behind Anjer a large lake of salt water has been formed.'

The indica- tion of the Premier's attitude is as encouragin-.r t.. earnest reformers as it must bo annoying to those sections of his party which have been contemning tho principlo he lays down. Naturally an attempt is made to quibble tho senso out of his words by arguing that ho could not moan what ho seemed to say, because identity of legislation for the three countries would mean a Crimes Act, a Land Act, and a Disestablishment Act for Great Britain. It is scarcely necessary to answer that <H,ual justice practically means con- ceding to each country its just claims ; and that England and Scotland have not yet demanded disestablishment and land reform a* Ireland demands parliamentary reform.

On tho other hand, however, it has to be pointed out that Luther's own ""ct wrought an enormous work ■r intellectual freedom, oven though ho tui 'lit not desire to eli'ect all he did. That he too had his amx'.ing superstitions and his fierce intolerances is but one of a thousand proofs that progress cannot bo otherwise than gradual.

To credit him downright with having been able to spread views which other men had [in ached in vain is really to forget that j these others had gone liefore him ; and that before he could have so moved public opinion it must have been in a state ready to bo moved. But perhaps tho !:st. danger of all besotting tho at- tempt to pronounce judgment on Luther I is the tendency to resolve all histori- c.i! philosophy into fatalism, and credit in- dividuals with nothing. That must bo I avoided at all hazards; and there is really sound standing-ground to be found in recog- nising Luther as a great assailant of a great .•iiriiu.il tyranny,who inspired his generation with his Hpirit; and as ono who mado eminently for righteousness despite tho flaws of his own nature.",English,The Evening News
1883-11-24,0000452- Edinburgh Evening Newsl,krakatoa,1,"THE VOLCANIC ERUPTION IN JAVA SCENE OF THE DISASTER. Lloyd's agent at Batavia, writing on October 16, says: I left Batavia on Monday, the Bth October, for Serang, the capital of the Residency of Bantam. There I was met by Mr Schmit, Lloyd's sub-agent for Anjer. We proceeded at once to Bantam Bay, seven miles distant, and saw on the way that considerable damage nad been done by the volcanic wave ? though the destruction generally was a mere nothing to what we saw in other places. Even here, however, 200 people lost tneir lives, and a good way inland we came upon native prows which had been cast in by the waters. Several hundred natives were here employed in clearing away the fallen trees and in digging a new canal to let the waters, which {had formed a lagoon, out. Further down the river, at the oM town of Bantam, the damage was .not so great,.and but few miles were lost. Returning to Serang, we left next morning at five for Tjielegon, now the last Government port on this station. This place was still, after six weeks, completely covered with volcanic ash, plants and gardens destroyed, and cocoa-nut trees borne down by the weight of the ash and mud dis- charged by Krakatoa, 40 miles away. Shortly afterwards we arrived at what was formerly the important station of Merak, attached to the Tan- jong Proak harbour works. The entire district traversed by us, about six miles, was one scene of desolation. Formiles there was not a tree standing; and where formerly stood numerous (native vil- lages surrounded by paddy fields and cocoa- nut groves, there was nothing but a wilderness, more resembling the bottom of the sea than anything else. Arriving at Merak, the path was strewn with pieces of iron, while here and there were portions of the bedding and furniture of the houses of the Europeans, and everywhere shreds of native clothing. We were informed officially that the number of bodies buried in the district we came through was 2700. Arriving at what was once th 6 centre of the Government Quarry Works for the Batavia harbour works, wo climbed the small hill where tho houses of the principal engineers and officials formerly stood. Of these there is literally not one stone left, and looking at the scene of desolation around, it was difficult to conceive that it had -once been a busy place employing over 1000 people. Strewn about were massive iron engines, locomotives, fragments of iron columns, ana rails torn up and twisted like wire. On the foundation of one of the houses on the hilltop of Merak, Mr Bursley, an American, formerly at Anjer, has erected a bamboo with flagstaff attached, and until something definite is settled about a new port of call, he had permission to make this a pOot station. Merak certainly did not strike me as being a suitable place for a port of call. There is a strong current, and if vessels were anohored in the lee of the outer islands it would not be easy to work them out again. Water is scarce, and there is no"" soil suitable in the im- mediate neighbourhood for gowing vegetables' fruits, &c.",English,THE VOLCANIC ERUPTION IN JAVA

1883-12-13,0000452- Edinburgh Evening News,krakatoa,1,"THE REGENT REMARKABLE SUNSETS. VOLCANIC DUST THEORY DISPUTED. Mr Cowper Ranyard, of Lincoln's Inn, writing in yesterday's Times, says the date of the great eruption of Krakatoa, an compared with the date of the earliest observations of the blue sun and abnormal sunset phenomena, would seem at first sight to favour the hypothesis that the colours are due to light dispersed by volcanic dust borne away by the trado winds; but a closer examination of the facts render such a connection improbable. Those who havo watched an eruption of Etna or Vesuvius know how the volcanic vapours are carried to a certain altitude above the crater, where they spread out in a horizontal cloud, which, under ordinary circumstances, does not attain a very great altitude. It is possible to con- ceive that such a cloud laden with dust in the neighbourhood of the equator, be carried up- wards by the heated air which gives rise to tne trade winds. But in tho northern hemisphere the trade winds blow in a north-easterly direction, and this theory will not account for the carriage of dust to India, which lies to the north-west of Java ; or to South Africa, which lies in a south- westerly direction. The tine dust of the Sahara, carried upwards by exceptionally strong winds, occasionally reaches Rome and Florence, but all traces of it are lost as far north as Paris and Lon- don. It seems, therefore, improbable that terres-! trial dust should bo carried upwards by the wind, and distributed over a whole hemisphere. It has* been suggested that dust was on this occasion projected by the volcanic forces to a far greater altitude than the altitude reached by the dust from the Sahara. But dust projected with great velocity would be rapidly stopped by tho resistance of the atmosphere, and would not, un- less borne away by the wind, be carried as far as stones and largo masses of scoria;. The volcanic theory is, however, completely negatived by tho observation of the blue sun setting in the fiery heavens, a» seen from Trinidad (ut-ur 4o the centre of tho opposite hemisphere from the Krakatoa eruption! on the 2d of September, for it cannot be supposed that the volcanic matter was carried half round the earth in the period of seven days which elapsed between the afternoon of Sunday, the 20th of August, when the Java eruption be- gan, and Sunday, the 2d of September, when the blue sun was seen setting at Trinidad. According to the letter of Mr W. B. Griffith published in the Times of December 5 the sun was seen from Cape Coast Castle, more than GOOO miles from Java, to rise blue on the mornings of the Ist and 2d of Sep- tember. Such observations simultaneously made at distant parts of the world render it more probable that the earth encountered a cloud of dust in space just before the Ist of Sep- tember. In a paper published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society for January 1879, is published a series of observations which show that meteorio dust is continually entering the earth's atmosphere, and is ultimately deposited on the earth's surface. If the dust- laden region was so large that the earth occupied many hours in passing through it, we may ex]>ect to find that the phenomena caused by the presence of dust in tho higher atmosphere were in the first instance observed over more than a hemisphere. The blue and green appearance of the sun while rising and setting seems only to have been noticed in the clear air of tne tropics. Mr A. H. S win ton, author of an "" Almanack of Solar Physics,"" writing to the Daily News on the same subject, says: A great deal of mystery has been made out of the late sunsets, some part of which might receive an easy solution. As wit- nessed here the phenomena have been a succession of sun halos or rainbows round tho sun, very simi- lar in character and identical in nature with those which, during the last few years, have been re- peatedly seen encircling the moon. In the case of the sun we have observed a bull's-eye of yellow light form, then an encompassing ring of ver- nnllion, .then a ring of pale flesh colour, surrounded with a pale glow that seems very suggestive of the zodiacal light. To-night the moon halo has returned, the bull's- eye is grey r surrounded with a red line and outer pale-blue ring, analogous in all respects to the sunset. Of course a very simple explanation of all this is that the atmosphere of our globe this autumn has been unusually saturated with moisture; and as regards this place, the hygro- metrical reoords published by Mr Capson, of Guildown, bear out these surmises.",English,THE REGENT REMARKABLE SUNSETS.
1883-12-14,0000237- The Lincoln Rutland and Stamford Mercury,krakatoa,1,"The. Reccnt Glotnng Sunsets.—Mr. Norman Lockyer lias brought the light of science to bear on the atmospheric phenomena which have lately been surprising and delighting Europe. It will be remembered that in August last .there was in one of the Java islands, Krakatoa, the most destructive volcanic eruption on record. The theory is that the force of the explosion carried away par- ticles of volcanic dust to the highest regions of the atmosphere, where they have become luminous through the aqueous vapour which surrounds the globe. An atmosphere at le:ist 40 miles deep clothes the earth. An aqueous vapour in great part composes it, and forms the reflecting medium. Generally the sunset tints are due to that aqueous vapour, which vibrates under the sun's rays. According to the density of the vapour, as it absorbs or intercepts one colour or another, the light it reflects is white, blue, violet, or red. Meteorologists have been enabled to track Krakatoa in solution from its original site in the Straits of Sunda to the skies above Java, to Madras, and other points in Southern India, to the Seychelles and Mauritius, to the Cape and the Gold Coast, to Brazil, Venezuela, and Trinidad. In the Seychelles and Brazil at the end of August and beginning of Septem- ber the sun had been as pale as the moon. Dr. Moldrum and Mr. Lockyer aro of opinion that the exploded frag- ments of Krakatoa and its volcanic roots have been dyeing European skies as they shrouded Java. Gradually the veil has become thinner and feebler. It has ceased to have power to hide the sun, or turn its face pale and silver. No longer do the sunbeams reach the earth blue and green and red as in Ceylon and Trinidad. Yet the dust of the dead mountains and crater has been here as real as at the instant of its fiery ejection, if less solid and deep. Though it could not subjugate the sun in its strength, it has had force to prolong its setting and to determine the tone of the after-glow "" On the 26th and 27th of last August there occurred the climax of the most tremendous volcanic eruption which, perhaps, the world has ever seen during historic times. In the course of it an island, 3000 ft. high or thereabouts, entirely disappeared. The usual volcanic products, includ- ing the finest particles both solid and vapourous, were ejected into the air to a height that no man will ever say, since for many miles round the scene of these devastating forces noon was as black as night, and darkness was over all the land for 36 or 40 hours. The scale on which the work was done was such that even the noise, the weakest part of it, was heard at a distance of 2000 miles. The shivering of the island produced a wave of water 100 ft. high, which destroyed everything over which it swept, and left its mark on tidal registers nearly all over the world. There was a British ship in the middle of all this horror, and surely no master mariner has ever had such a story to tell as Capt. Watson of the Charles Ball. At 3*30 on the 26th he was near the island of Krakatoa, in the Straits of Sunda. He heard above the ship and all around a strange sound as of a crackling fire, solid matter apparently, or whatever it was, being propelled with alarming velocity to the north- east. At 5 the roaring noise continued and increased; pumice stones hot and large fell on the deck; skylights, heads, and feet had to be protected from the downpour. After tbis a steady fall of a smaller kind, blinding to the eyes and speedily covering the decks three or four inches deep, and then * an intense blackness covered the sky and land and sea. The blinding fall of sand and stones, the intense blackness above and around us, broken only by the incessant glare of various kinds of lightning and the con- tinued explosive roars of Krakatoa, made our situation a truly awful one.' Bad as it was, it was to get worse, as the following statement in Capt. Watson's own words shows:— ""At 11 p.m., having stood off from the Java shore, wind strong from the south-west, the island, west-north-weet, 11 miles distant, became mere visible, of fire appearing to ascend and descend between the sky and it, while on the south-west end there seemed to be a continued MH ot balls of white fire; the wind, though strong, was hot and choking, sulphurous, with a smell as of burning cinders, some of the pieces falling on us being like inn cinders and the lead from a bottom of 30 fathoms up quite watm.

Sir, —At the special general meeting of the members of tne Lincolnshire Chamber of Agriculture and the Land Agents' and Tenants' Rights Valuers' Association, held at Lincoln on the 30th of November, it was resolved That in the opinion of this meeting it is desirable to adopt the undermentioned scale of allowances as fair and reasonable compensation under part 3 of the first schedule of the Agricultural Holdings Act, 1883, to be substituted by agree- ments for compensation under the Act, viz. 1. ror one-third of the cost of linseed cake, cotton cake, rape cake, or malt culm, and one-sixth of the cost of corn cake, malt, or other manufactured feeding stuffs of similar inanurwl vahu, which have been consumed on the farm during tne last year of the tenancy; and for one-sixth of the cost of linseed cake, cotton cake, rape cake, or malt culm, and one- twelfth of the cost of corn cake, malt or other inamijacturecl feeding stuffs of similar manurial value which shall have been consumed on the farm during the preceding year of the tenancy. , , . ~ . I write to ask the meaning of the words above in italics, ana to what they refer ? How far do they go 1 I consider them very vague and unsatisfactory. Out other munv i f(ictuT€d fccdwm stuffs may be counted on the fingers of one hand. Why, then, are they not enumerated ? Do they refer to lamb food. In my opinion the most valuable autumn food for lambs ever invented. Do they refer to barley meal? Every farmer uses some, many6ome thousands of stones a year, in the feeding of pigs, &c. My experience teaches me that pig manure beats all other for sand land, and is as good as most others for any kind of land. Is oatmeal or crushed oats included? If not they ought to be; it grows young stock better than any other food, it is safer than any other, and its manurial value is quite as great as the allowance. Is the desirable but diuretic pea, the feeding but flatulent bean, to be left out in the cold ? I hope not; they are exceed- ingly rich in nitrogen, and consequently invaluable as an assistant food and as manure. Will maize be allowed for ? 1 was very much amused at the meeting of the Chamber of Agriculture a few weeks ago, to which friends were invited, to see the expression of pious horror depicted on the face and in the uplifted hands of an ""Old Fogie,"" who declared ""We can't admit maize; our cart horses eat it."" This was in answer to a proposed but not seconded resolu- tion, that maize be inserted instead of malt and corn cakc ; thus trying to still further play into the foreigners' hands. If maize isof any manurial value, and in the lasttrialsat Wobum it has beaten the very much Voelcker-vaunted decorticated cottoncakes. What think you to that, my countrymen? And asaflcsh-formeritbeat it hollow, as everyone mightexpect it would. Considering that our cart horses spend 10 hours in the stable, seven on the farm, and one on the roads, we have submitted quite long enough to the unjust practice of having the cake they consume all strictly deducted from valuations. The old Lincolnshire tenant-right custom has lost this county thousands of pounds a year in moat alone through encouraging the use of cotton and rape and discouraging the use of our home-grown feeding stuffs, and many more thousands still have, from the same causc, been put into the foreigners' pockets which now would have been more appreciated by landlords and tenants alike had they been left in our own. If this suicidal policy- had not been in vogue, would oats and grinding barley be at 9d. a stone ? I think not. I wish to extend and not curtail the privileges of the farmers, and there is no privilege they enjoy so much as that of grumbling, and no grumbling they practice more than against the Government of the day for fostering foreign trade at the expense of our own produc- tions. If we do not insist on home produce being put on the same footing as foreign in our tenant rights, we must rendar ourselves liable to the retort "" that season comes, Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated."" (I hope I may be pardoned using it.) First cast out the beam that is in thine own eye, then shalt thou see to pull out the mote that is in thy brother's (Government's) eye.—l thank you for the insertion of this letter, and remain, sir, j'Our obedient servant, W.

1883-12-31,0000325- The Citizen Gloucester,krakatoa,1,"1883. THE STORY OF THE YEAR. THE CITIZEN, MONDAY, DECEMBER 31, 1883. The Curfew this evening will toll the knell of the parting year 1883, and to-morrow we start upon a New Tear with its doubts and fears, its hopes and expecta- tions. The year 1883 is not conspicuous for events so great as those, which in the year preceding, onlminated | in the disastrous Tel-el-Kebir. But it has been aba y j and eventful one at home. Politics and political , measures of reform have been eagerly discussed both ] when Parliament was sitting aud during the recess, j During the whole year Ireland has been a sore thorn , in the side of the Government, and it is still confronted , with problems as great and complicated as ever per- , plexei the minds of Statesmen. At the end of last year some improvement was noticed in the internal stats of Ireland through the vigorous enforcement of the Crimes Act by Lord Spenoer and Mr. Trevelyan, and agrarian crime and bojojttiug had partially ceattd. Than Veto the workingof the Land Act the improvement is maintained, and rents are paid with tolerable regularity. There are but few signs that indicate, however, that the general feeling of the Irish people is changed towards the English ; and the presentation of £40,000 recently made to Mr. Parnell could not possibly have been raised among so poor a people had not the Irish peasantry so bitterly detested those who have strived hard to help them. Mr. Parnell attacks this country more virulently than ever, and has again and again repeated that Ireland rrill not be sati fied even with Home Rule. What they aim at is a sever- ance of every bond of union between the two countries. The North of Ireland has been disturbed by revolutions ; but they have not made much way. Sir Stafford Northcote visited Ulster, and the loyal population, endeavoured to efface the impression produced by hia visit. This little incident was not lost upon the English, for it reminded us that there are really two parties in Ireland, and oivil war is not entirely out of the question. The American-Irish party, too, has done its best to alarm us. O'Donovan Rosea and his accom- plices talk openly and in the market place of the most atrocious crimes. These threats were more than idle words for on the 15th March an attempt was made to blow up the Times and Local Government Board offices whioh were considerably damaged. The police became vigilant and bands of conspirators were arrested in Birmingham and London. England appreciated the danger she was in, and a bill amending the existing law as to explosives, was introduced and passed in a fewhcurs. The dynamite method of upholding Irish ideaß is stili to be guarded againßt, ani the recent explosion npon the Underg<ound Railway warns us of the power of ruffians. It is not creditable to Irish leaders that, they have nothing to my against this wholesale mur- dering of innocent men, women and children. The murder of Carey, with all its horrible details, is still too- green in people's memory. O'Donnell was tried, con- demned, hanged ; and so ends, we hope, one of the foulest incidents in Irish history. Some Ministerial changes at the close of last year resulting from Mr. Gladstone's resignation of the Exohequer, an exchange of offices between Mr. Childers, Lord Kimberly, Lord Hartington, and Mr. Dodson, and the admission to the Cabinet of Lord Derby and Sir Charles Dilke, were completed at the beginning of January. Lord E. Fitzmaurice became Under-Secretary at the Foreign Office, and Mr. Brand, son of the Speaker, was made Surveyor-General of the Ordnance. Some months later, on the resignation of Lord Rosebery, Mr. Hibbert was appointed Under- Secretary for the Home Department, and a place was found for Mr. George Russell as Secretary of the Local Government Board. But in its essential composition the Administration remained unchanged throughout tha year. When Parliament was opened on the 15th of February, although the condition of Ireland was very far from satisfactory, it- was deemed expedient to give some time and attention to the needs of England and Scotland. The Parlia- mentary Sessions of the year have not a happy history. In spite of new rules of procedure and an unlimited power invested with the Speaker by the cloture motion, many debates were prolonged to a tedious length, and many evenings spent in acrid and fruitless ""jaw."" StU t. some useful measv lwere passed, and the system of Grand Comnv* ' so successful that they may be co""""' ercentive development. •>eas n re whioh became designed for usation for also much '. The Bill re excited aa York elections, lany cabmen at York refused to vote for the Liberal candidate because the Liberal Government had robbed them of "" turning an honest penny."" A Nationa Debt was adopted, and the Bankruptcy Bill, which was so expeditiously managed by Mr. Chamberlain, met with general approval in both Houses. The Deceased Wife's Sister Bill was read a second time in the House of Lords, and on a third reading was rejected by a small majority. A Bill for the suppression of pigeon shooting was got through iv the Commons, but rejected in the Upper House. One of the longest and most exciting debates of the Session related to the Affirmation Bi'l„ when Mr. Gladstone made a strong speech in favour of it. There were for the Bill 289 votes, against 292. Thus Mr. Bradlaugh is still excluded from his seat, and some trouble may yet be expeoted from the member for Northampton. Bat politics and discussions on measures brought forward by the Government have raged with greater force outside the doors of the House than within. During the recess both parties have shown unwonted activity. The Prime Minister, in the midst of the labours of the Session, encouraged his party in a powerful speech delivered at the opening of the National Liberal Club ; Mr. Chamberlain, both before and afterwards, has boldly carried the war "" into Africa,"" denouncing those "" who toil not, neither de they spin,""' with special application to the peers and individually to Lord Salisbury. On the other hand the Conservative chiefs were not less energetic and aggressive. Lord Salisbury and Sir Stafford Northcote, as well as others of less conspicuous and responsible position, seized every opportunity of placing their views before the country. On both sides the exigencies of party masterel any differences of opinion and personal jealousies. It was noted that this session was the first since the General Election in which the Government had lost none of its members through a disagreement on matters of policy, for Lord Roeebert's resignation, avowedly to facilitate the Ministerial arrangements, was not to be compared with the successive losses of the Marquis of Lausdowne, the Duke of Argyll, Mr. Forster, and Mr. Bright. Both parti's seem to feel that next Session will be a» critical one. Conservatives attack the whole Liberal policy at home and abroad, especially denouncing the conduct of affairs in Ireland. Egypt, and South Af rica r Liberals believed they had a good defence to make on all points, but to "" make assurance doubly sure,"" a con- ference of thg representatives of Liberal organizations was held at Leeds, at which it was resolved, in spite of the objections urged by those interested in the abolition, of the old Corporation of London and of the exiatingr administrative authorities in the counties, to insist that the Government give precedence next year to the promised measure of Parliamentary reform. The cry of '• Reform"" became the Liberal watch- word. Conservatives have maintained an attitude of B cautious observation,"" a policy commended to hie friends subsequently by Sir Stafford Northcote, but not oae calculated to produce a striking effect upon public opinion. Even the more energetic spokesmen of the Opposition, Lord Salisbury in England and Mr. Gibson in Scotland, contented themselves with suggesting difficulties aud demanding that the- j whole of the Government scheme thould be I disclosed before a decisive judgment was de- manded upon it from Parliament and the country. | A Franchise Bill is to be introduced next Session, but ; it is not a decided question whether the measure should be accompanied by a Redistribution measure, \ or that the same franchise should extend to England, Scotland, and Ireland. La.'ely, also, of the housing of the poor has excited a good deal of interest. It was discussed in an able article from the pen of ! Lord Salisbury in the Nat onal Review, and answered by a less temperate, but equally able, reply from Mr. Chamberlain, who made it a text for an attack on the landowning classes, 'on whom he proposed to throw the charge of removing insanitary dwellings and replacing them by good houses built under municipal direction. The subject is still left, as the houses, in a most unsatisfactory state, and fresh legislation is not considered advisable until the question has been thoroughly investigated by a Royal Commission. On this question Sir C. Pilke has made himself much respected by his administrative ability In the spring Lord Randolph Churchill made himself notorious and raised a deal of discussion relative to a letter to the Timet on Conservative leadership. Lord Randolph still acknowledges both Sir Stafford Northcote and Lord Silisbnry as chief. To from the last Parlia- mentary return, Mr. Gladstone's Government is not so popular as it was ; but the head of the Government is still regarded with great enthusiasm— witness the beautiful gift just presented to him by the Liberal working-men of Derby. Of foreign affairs France claims tha greatest share of attention. The extraordinary and almost phenomenal methods of procedure employed by her Governors nearly ended in the disruption of the Repubhoan party, a fact which was only averted by the folly of Prince Napoleon. France is everywhere in hot, water, and stands almost isolated among European nations. After the excitement caused by the death of M Gambetta (when France seemed to be hopelessly stranded),and the issue of a manifestation by Prince Napoleon, M. Doolero resigned the office of Prime Minister and M. Julei Ferry reigned in his stead. In home affairs he has pursued a moderate and unobtrusive -olicy ; but in foreign affairs, he has shown a restlessness and desire for aggrandisement nneqsalled by any of his Republican predecessors. In Madagascar a controversy with the Hova Government in Madagascar had arisen the year before, and in the spring Admiral Pierre's squadron was sent out to re- establish ""French rights"" over the north-west of the island. The Admiral bombarded and held the port of Tamatave, and the Btress of these measures was chiefly felt by the European residents, for the most part English merchants or missionaries. The Hovas at once retired into the interior, where the French appear to have been unable fer months past to make any further impression upon them. Admiral Pierre acted with insolence towards British residents, and towards Captain Johnstone of the Dryad, whose deck was once cleared for action. Then follows the story of the treatment of the Rev. G. Shaw, and his trial for an alleged attempt to poison French sailors. The rest of this deplorable incident is well known. The French Government ultimately (and ungraciously) compensated the reverend gentleman, and pacified the English Government by an explanation. M. Ferry too, was possessed of astrongdesire to occupy Tonquin, and to establish a protectorate (or annex) the King- dom of Anam. China has resisted French pretensions, and the latest intelligence iB tbat Admiral Courbet has captured SonVay, and is advancing upon Bac-Ninh, the seizure of whioh fortress the Marqiis Tseng has declared will be considered a eatus belli by tha Chinese. Frarjce has made herself disliked by her treatment of King Alfomo, when he paid a royal visit to their capital. By their insult, however, France did good service to the insulted, for it hea'ed tbe slight breach between Alfonso and the Spanish people. Things are still unsatisfactory in Egypt. The Egyptians complain that we will not let them alone, nor give them that vigorous support without which the State cannot be properly re-organised. In the Soudan, the army of Hic'ts Pasha, which went to suppress the Mahdi, was annihilated ; and British troops are retained at Cairo. ' J ,fc ahnn]d stated, disapproved of the at and Egypt will not be enco. conau' , «t of a countr* which e^ be incapable of holding. • desolated by cholera which About 27,000 persons died of tl In India there has been considerable commotion upon the Ilbert Bill, whioh has been resisted by the whole Anglo-Indian population. It is for the purpose of conferring on a limited class of native judges, jurisdic- tion over British subjects. Happily a compromise has been arrived at. Zululand is still unsettled, and the fate of its King trembles in the balance. The Boers crave absolute freedom, and delegates from the Transvaal have waited upon Lord Derby, and oontinue to do so without any apparent result. England intends to redume her protectorate of the Basuto tribes, which is the only satisfactory news from South Africa. In Australasia, the event of 1883 is the annexation of New Guinea. Lord Lome has been succeeded by Lord Lanßdowne as Governor-General of Canada; and nothing has happened this year to check the growing prosperity of the dominion. Germany is still in high repute, and beyond now and then throwing out a nasty lance against France, Prince Bismarck has busied himself with the consideration of measures for the benefit of the working classes. Italy is prosperous and in alliance with Germany and Austria. Hungary has claimed more than her share of attention by riots in Vienna and the t-ial of Jews for the murder of a Christian girl. The Czar was crowned at Moscow in May, and Nihilism is less active. The people of the United States have been intensely interested in the movements of Irish fanatics. The prospects of the Democratic party are Btill favourable, and the Protectionists carried a Tariff Bill. Among the remarkable events, outside the region of politics, of the past twelve months, we have to record at home the success of the Fisheries Exhibition at South Kensington ; the transfer of the Law Courts from Westminster and Lincoln's Inn to the new buildings at Temple Bar ; the collapse of the Channel Tunnel Scheme and of the Manchester Ship Canal project; the celebration of Sir Moses Montefiore a entrance upon his hundredth sear; the successful introduction of the Parcels Post into this country, with the promise of cheapened telegrams and other postal improvements by Mr. Fawcett, and the ac- ceptance of a peerage by the Poet Laureate The Lord Chief Justice met with a very cordial reception in the United States, and among international affairs the celebration of the 400 th anniversary of Luther's birth should find a place. The destruction of Casamicciola, in the Island of Isehia, by an earth- quake was exceeded in horror by the stupendous upheaval of Krakatoa, on the coast of Java, the most formidable volcanic eruption recorded in modern times. The explosion and the tidal wave that followed it swept away, it was computed, at least 50,000 human beings, and transformed the geography of the region of the Sunda Straits. To this event some scientific authorities have referred the magnificent sunsets observed all over the world in November and December, but the theory has not been universally accepted. The obituary of 1883 includes among English public men who have passed away such names as the Dnke of Marlborough, beßt kDown as Viceroy of Ireland under Lord Beaconsfield; Lord Overstone, the ablest and most influential of English capitalists and the highest authority for many years on financial ques- tions ; Sir George Jessel, Master of the Rolls ; Mr. Law ( Lord Chancellor of Ireland, who had a large share in the authorship and conduct through Parliament of the Land Act ; Dr. Colenso, Bishop of Natal; three ex-judges of distinguished merit, Sir Samuel Martin, Sir Bichard Amphlett, and Sir Charles Hall ; and General Sir W. F. Williams, whose defence of Karß will live in history. Science has suffered in the deaths of Sir W. Siemens, and Professor Smith, the profound mathematician. English literature has suffered in the ! lobs of Mr. J. R. Green, the historian; and art in Richard Doyle. Others who have joined the majority are Mr. Holloway the philanthropist, Captain Mayne Reid, j Captain Webb, and John Brown. France has lost M- ! Gambetta, the Comte de Chambord. and Henri Martin tha historian ; in art, M. Guftave Dore : in society, the | Comta de Lagrange. Germany moarns for Herr j Wagner, for Flotow, and the veteran scholar Dindorf. Busiia has lost Piioce Gortsohakoff, and Ivan Turgenieff, the most powerful imaginative writer I Slavonic literature ever boasted.
