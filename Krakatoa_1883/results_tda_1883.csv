1883-08-30,"18830830","krakatoa",1,"VOLOAYIC BRuPTIONS ASD TiDAL WA YES. Seismology is one of the youngest of sciences, but Xts progress is not likely to be hindered from lack Df material. Scarcely have we recovered frorm the shock of the Ischia calamity when vague news of a somewhat similar catastrophe reaches us from the other sido of the world. Java is celebrated for its volecanoes, just as Japan, furthernorth, isnoto- rious for its earthquakes-so notorious that an irri- ta'oble seismologist has called it " tho lid of Hell." Every Englishman Avho has journeyed to the far East is familiar with Anjer Point, on the north- Ivest coast of Java, as one of the welcome places of call where a stock of fresh vegetables and fruit can 'be laid in. Opposite this, in Sanda Strait, lies the volcanic island of Krakatoa, the eruption of which has led to what is feared may be a sweeping disas- ter. Serang and Batavia, we are told, were in .larkness on the 27th, while the ashes and stones discharged from the volcano had travellod as far as Cheribon, some 250 miles east of their source. To complicate matters, what is called a " tidal wave " had rushed apparently over the west and north- west coast of the islands, choked up the rivers, overflowed the land, and swept away the European quarter at Anjer and the Chinese camp at Mlerak. It is to be feared that there must have been con- 'siderable destruction of life, but to wvhat extent pannot be known till details arrive. Java,withits 16active,andinnumerable quiescent, volcanoes, is used to eruptions, some of which have been even more destructivo than the Ischia earth- quake. This volcano of Krakatoa has been in a state of unusual activity for some weeks, and had it not been for the " tidal wave," its activity might have subsided 'without doing material damage. FSome of the Java volcanoes rise to a height0of 12,0O0ft., and, as we have said, in past time their beruptions have been enormously destructive. In 1772, for example, the volcano of Papandayang, in the south-west part of the island, threw out such Ian immense quantity of scorime and ashes in a single nigyht, that an area having a radius of seven miles was covered with a layer 60ft. thick. Forty native wviilages were buried beneath it, and 3,000 persons ero supposed to have perished in this one night. Still more terribly destructive -was the eruption of Mount Galunggong, a few miles east of the former, on October 8, 1822. At midday, under a cloadless Fky, with not a breath stirring, a dark, dense mass rose from the old volcano and spread itself out wvith such appalling rapidity that in a fewv moments the whole landscape was shrouded in the darkness of night. Bright Bashes o3casionally pierced the dark- naess ; a deluge of hot water and mud shot up frorm the crater, and poured down the mountain sie7es, sweeping away trees and beasts and human bodies in its seethingmass. early everything was de- stroyed for a radins of 20 miles roiund. A second eruption four days after completed the catastrophe. This was accompanied by an earthquake; the sum- rnit of the mountain wvas broken dowvn; one side, 'overed with forest, became a semi-circular golf 'enw hills and valleys are said to have been formed, 'and rivers had their courses changed. As ,any as 114 villages were destroyed, and 4,000 people killed. The remarkable thing is that no record ex- isted of any prvious eruption of the mountain, wvhich was situated in one of the most fertile valleys of Java. n 184S it is estimated that Blount Cumtuo flung, firth ashes and sand to the extent of 2'0,000,000 tons; in 1S67 an earthquake caused the death of 1,000Opeople in the towvn of Jokgokarta alone; in 187>2 one of the most active volcanoes, lIerapi, brought death to many of the dwellers around; while the damage to be feared from the ashes throvm out by the same mountain interferes with the planting of coffee in the neighbouring dis- tricts. Earthquakes destructive to life are of fre- quent occurrence; the most celebrated is that of January 5, 1699, when 203 shocks were felt, and many houses in Batavia destroyed. Mlud volca- noes, gas fountains, and hot springs are common over the island. From Java to lfamchatka seis- mical phenomena in the shape of volcanoes and earthquakes aro of constant occurrence, though the accompanying tidal wave is not so common as we find it on the other side of the Pacific or the coast of South America. There seems little doubt that the so-called "tidal wave " whichlhas swept over the coast of Sava is intimately connected with the volcanic activity of the mountain in -.he bay. This kind of wave is of a totally different character and origin from the last destructive wave that visi.ed that qutarter of the vworld, the cyclone wave of Bengel, on October 31, 1876, which, sweeDing up tho Bay of B1engal to the low-lying country around the mouth of the Ganges, covered an area of 3,000 square miles, and inl a fe minutes destroyed 215,000 lives. The natutre and causes of cyclonic storms -we described at the time. But the wave which has swept over Java has quite a different origin, though what is the exact connexion between such phenomena and earthquakes and volcanic action seismologists have not yet determined. The last great manifestation of the kind was on June 10, 1877, when an enor- mou-s wave spread itself from the Sancldwich islands to the Peruvian coast. and even made itself felt in Australia and Ivew Zealand. This wave was cer- tainly coincident with a violent eruption of Mount Kilanea, in Eawaii, and with frequent earthquake shocks and eruptions on the -west coast of South America. Both in the Sandwich 1slands and in Peru the wave repeatedly charged over the land, carrying ships far inland, and destroyingeverythingr tbhat came in its way. Curiously enough, on the same date a very marked shock of earthquako was felt at Comrie, in Scotland, tho most frequent centre of seismic activity in this country. But this earthquake wave was not nearly so destructive to life as that which in 1868 destroyed the towns of Arica and Arequipa, in Peru, when 30,000 lives were lost. There seems little doubt, then, that the so-called tidal wave vhich has swept over the west coast of Java is really of seismic origin, and is akin to tZhose earthquake waves which have been so de- structive elsewhere. But what is the exact relation between the activity of Krakatoa volcano and the wave cannot be determined till -urther details come to hand.",English,"/mnt/lustre/rfilguei/TDA_GDA_1785-2009/1883/18830830/0FFO-1883-AUG30.xml"

1883-12-08,"18831208","krakatoa",1,"MP. NoRMAN LocaYxa brings the light of science this morning to bear on the atmospheric pheno- mena which have lately been surprising and de- lighting Europe. Sunrises and sunsets are the most exquisite spectacles which nature affords. The colours which ac2ompany them are enchanting everywhere. They are not less glorious in Hyde Park than on the crest of a Swiss mountain. But Commonly they have been left to poets to dilate on and glorify. Imagination is captivated by them, and lends them hues of its own. Nothing seems more fleetiDg and visionary and immaterial. Wher rhey embody any substance it has been regarded as peculiarly local. Against London smoke is set the lurid splendour it adds to the tints of a London sunset. MI. LocY:kt teaches that science has as close concern with these prismatic marvels as fancy. He bids the lovely apparitions render an account of their birth and composition. Though they remain as brilliant and beautiful as ever, they are seen by bis analysis to want food lile other splendid creatures. Marine anemones, which areas delicate as a rose, require to be nourished on raw meat. The ethereal pomps of tho last fortnight or more are reported to bavo derived their wondrous complexion from a plentiful diet of pumice-stones. By the hypothesis they are brought down from their height of impalpable purity to acknowledge ,that they are earthy like the rest of us. In return science invests them with a dignity of strangeness and distance to which they never before presumed to aspire. The founda- tions of the globe have been poured into the air for the admiration of Londoners. According to the view now set forth the crowds that gazed on a sight in the heavens tvhich TuR-NER himself would not have dared to portray were assisting at a celebration of the obsequies of the Isle of Krakatoa. Aloft in the skies were its ashes. The sun was escorting them with an illumination of the most bewitching funeral torches to their final rest- ing-place in the northern ocean. It is an amazing story which DB. MRLDRum, watching sunsets in the Indian seas, sketched in outline, and Mnt. LocIYER has elaborated, on this basis. An atmcsphere at least forty miles deep clothes the earth. An aqueous vapour in great part composes it, and forms the reflecting mediura. Generally the sunset tints are due to that aqueous vapour, which vibrates under the sun's ravs. According to the density of the vapour, as it absorbs or intercepts one colour or anotber, the light it reflects is wvhite, blue, violet, or red. Ordinarily it would have been inferred from the surpassing lustre of the sunrises and sunsets during the last two or ti reo weelks that for some reason the band of aqueous vapour had thickened. Had the facts answered. they would have explained the result. The atmosphere has been submitted to tlhe thumb- screw of the spectroscopo, and negatives the theory altogether. In the period in question the dry air band is pronounced to have enlarged at the expense of the watery. Recent vivid greens and crimsons must have traversed an extra length of dry instead of aqueous vapour. Had meteorolo- gical science and the spectroscope existed in old days, when there was neither steam nor the tele- graph, inquirers must have paused in utter per- plexity in the presence of these contradictory con- clusions. Now the accelerated facilities for the transmission of news have accumulated in the briefest interval a mass of evidence -which indi- cates a way out of the scientific dilemma. Meteorologists have been enabled to track Xraka- toa in solution from its original site in tho Straits of Sunda to tho skies above Java, to Madras, and other points in Soithern India, to the Seychelles and Mauritius, to tho CaDe and the Gold Coast, to Brazil, Venezuela, and Trinidad. Over Java there was a paU of black night on that terrible 28th of August. Madras lVas confounded by a bright green sun at s71nrise and sunset from the 5th to the 14th of September. In the Seyehilles and Brazil at the end of August and beginning of Sep- tember the sun had been as pale as the moon. Thiree months later, about the period at which, with the DrevAiling currents of the upper air, and in the anticipated direction, matter floating in the atmo- sphere would be due in Europe, European skies have been visited with a succession of gorgeous sun- rises and sunsets. DR. MELDRU3'S and Afs. TOOKYER's view is at any rate in agreement witb the circumstances, and has the merit of accounting for them. It is that the exploded fragments of Krakatoa and its volcanic roots have been dyeing European skies aa they shrouded Java. Gradually the veil has become thinner and feebler. It has ceased to have power to hide the sun, or turn its iace pale and silver. No longer do the sunheams reach the earth blue and green and red as in Ceylon and Trinidad. Yet the dust of the dead mountains and crater has bean here as real as at tne instant of its fiery ejection, if less solid and deep. Though it could not subjugate the sun in its strengi;b, it has bad force to prolong its setting and to deter- mine the tone of tho after-glow. Poetry will scarcely complain of science for its habit of weighing the sun and dissecting the rain- bow when it introduces the mind thus to the saecret workings of tho laboratory of nature. Nature has often been drawn smiling as she over- throws human hopes and hurries mortals to pre- mature death. Never has her supposed combina- tion of serene remorselessness and artistic sensi- bility been exhibited by a iacralizing poet or novelist more graphically than in the scene in which science shows her wrecking islands and paint- ing the skies imperial purples with pigments con- cocted from the awful ruin. The actual moral which science would deduce for itself from the new hypothesis of the construction of the glow of eawn and ovening is in itself no less poetical than philo- sophically suggestive. Like every fresh stage reached in science, it serves to confirm the truth of the connexion of the universe in all its parts and all its operations. The world is one; and its laws and its constituents affect and supplement and balance one another. WVithin the last dozen Nears the earth seems to have been passing through an epoch of volcanic perturbation such as strained human fears beyond all bearing eighteen hundred years ago.; Modern science does not disguise the weight of modern physical calamities. In a manner it reduplicates the force of the blow by depicting it rolling backwards and forwards, and reverberat- ing from pole to pole. With all this it must be admitted to take away half the terrors af such disasters by reducing them within the compass of intellectual calculation, and tending to bring them nader the yoke of one czommon law. Men 'rho quake at the sbadow of an affliction imagined to be the work of cbance will suffer with resignation thrice the misfortunes so long as they can account for them.",English,"/mnt/lustre/rfilguei/TDA_GDA_1785-2009/1883/18831208/0FFO-1883-DEC08.xml"
1883-12-08,"18831208","krakatoa",1,"THE RECBNT SUNRIBBS AIND SUNSBTS. There must be very few in these islands who have not noticed the Omarvels, and the feast " eonder, out of West and East," which have for the last three weeks enthralled all lovers of Nature to an astonishing degree; but that the recent sky-glows should merely continue for us phenomena which have been observed for the last three months, now in one and now in another quarter of the world, is, perhaps, among the ahings naot generally known. It was pointed out some years ago that the then recent advances of science were gradually, bringing these exquisite phenomena of cloud and sky-land, as far as colour is concerned, more and more under the domain of law. But, in fact, the question raised by the recent sunrises and sunsets is not the ordinary one ; there has been a new idea super- added, an idea suggesting a cause for them so far outside ordinary conceptions that it will be scouted by many as beyond even legiti- mate imagination, though it is not now suggested for . the first time. We are, in fact, brought face to face with the question whether or not we are now, in the month of De- cember, witnessing effects for the cause of which we must go back to a gigantic experiment, by far the biggest terrestrial experiment on record, made by Dame Nature during the month of last August. This being so, it will be seen at once that, as has been remarked, the mere question of the origin of sunset colour, as ordinarily observed, is left far behind; but still, when Nature works on a large scale, the principles whvich she calls into action have usually such a oneness and simplicity about them that we may expect some very close connexion between the methods of operation employed, wvhether in ordinary or extraordinary fashion. Let us consider the ordinary case first. The ori- gin of all the colour in our sunsets, as well as of all the light received from the various bodies in the Ulniverse, whether that light be extrinsic or in- trinsic, depends uDon the state of unrest of the par- ticles of matter of which those bodies are built up. A sympathetic ether lays hold of these quiverings and conveys them from sun to cloud, or from lamp to book, where again are found other sympathetic particles which yield to the gentle pulses of the ether, and thus are enabled to sing the same song independent of intervening space-or, in other words, to reflect the light which falls upon them. That is the first general idea. The next is this:- When we come to very fine particles of matter, whether in sun or sky, their quivering or their vibratiou gets more and more specialized, in a manner to be explained further on. If they vibrate ana so give ouc ignit ot their own, the light they give out is special. If they are receptive merely, then they do not answer to all the calls that the ether makes upon them,; they respond to some ouly-each must be wooed in its own way. It is a case of human sympathy over again. That is the second point. Now to the application. The aqueous vapour (and possibly some other constitu- ents) in our atmosphere, in some of its forms, is specialized in the way above indicated. The sun- light conveyed to us by the ether is of a com- plexity which baffles all description, and it is this complexity whieh gives us the idea of white light. The complexity, when we can analyze it, takes, as is well knowvn, the form of colour, and the light of the sun when thus analyzed gives us a rainbow band of colour from violet and blue at one end to red and orange at the other, the mid space being occupied by green. iNow, it is the blue and the violet light to which those forms of the apueous vapour which we are now alone considering in our air respond, and which, in fact, it absorbs or stops. But this is not all. This function of the aqueous vapour is best observed when it is at work on the largest scale-that-is to say,when we study the lioht which comes through the greatest thick- ness of it. oYow take a penny and a halfpenny and. with a pencil trace round them two concen- tric circles, and let the space between the two circumferences represent the earth's atmosphere, the circumference of the halfpenny representin& the crust of the earth. Take any point on the crust and draw a line to it from the boundarv of the atmosphere (the circumference of the penny) in the direction of the centre of the earth, represented by the halfpenny; that will give us the thickness of atmosphere through which we see the sun when in or near the zenitlh, or, we may say, roughly, at noon in England. It is within the experience of all that this thickness of atmosphere, with its in- cluded aqueous vapour, is not sufficient to greatly alter the white light of the sun. But now, through the point on the crust that we have selected, let us draw a line,at right angles to the former one,to the boundary of the atmosphere right and left. it is obvious that this represents our line of sight when we look at the sun at rising or setting. It is also clear that under these conditions the sight traverses a much greater thickness of air, and it is again familiar to us all that under them we see the sun not white, as before, but red. Now, the simple reason of this redness is as follows :-The greater thickness of aqueous vapour traversed m the second case has enabled its special absorbing power to come effectually into play. As I have stated, this has reference to the blue and violet light ; and experiment shows that when we subtract blue light from white light the residuum is red. We perform this experiment whenever we look at anything white through red glass, for red glassis red because it stops the blue. So much, then, for the red colour seen at sunset under ordi- nary conditions. Experiments undertaken some years ago, having no reference whatever, in the first instance, to the aqueous vapour in our air, soon gave us reason for believing that very many, if not all, substances may be made,under certain con- ditions,to absorb or stop blue light passing through them. and that under ather rmS,lir.;n,- shmade to stop the red, and the expressions ' blue molecules " and " red molecules " were coined to indicate this peculiar action. It may be added that the emperiments indicated the red molecules to be coarser than the blue. This must be well borne in mind. The first application of this new knowledge, or, let me say, new suggestion, to aqueous vapour wvas made when the sun was ob- served a brilliant green through steam blowing off in great quantities from a little steamer onWinder- mere, and again when it wvas seen through a thick mist on tho summit of the Simplon Pass. Why green, it will be asked. The answer is simple. Because the blue at one end of the rainbow band called the spectrum and the red at the other were bothi absorbed, in this case stopped by something be- tween the eye and the sun, leaving only the green light, which, as I have before stated, occupies tho mid space, free to pass through. If any one who reads this will buy a piece of gold leaf, as he can easily do at a colourman's, gun it carefully on to a piece of glass, and then look at the sun through it, he or she will see the sun of that same wondrous green that I saw on WVindermere and on the Sim- plon. Now, it is possible by certain chemical operations to dissolve that gold leaf so that the solution produced will stop either the blue light that attempts to pass through it or the red, accord- ing to the solvent employed. We can, in fact thus get the " red and blue molecules " of gold into separate bottles, and this is a proceeding held very dear by chemists. It has been shown already how the power of absorbing the blue light possessed by the aqueous vapour easily explains al the glories of a sunset so varied, so transcendently beautiful that our finest colourists are but as children in front of them. But the two points I wish to make here are that under ordinary circumstances the red molecules of aqueous vapour scarcely ever zoMe into play and that if by any chance our air was supplied with molecules having this trick of red absorption from whatever source, for it is by no means a peculiarity of aqueous vapour, we should see the sun green as commonly as we see it red, and our ordinary conceptions of sunset colours would be entirely changed. We should at once find ourselves in a fairyland of colour. N ow, my readers must bear with me for a little, while I appear to make a great digression. On the 2Gth and 27th of last August there occurred the clima% of the most tremendous volcanic eruption which, n perhaps, the wvorld has ever seen during historic times. In tho course of it an island, 3000ft. high or thereabouts, entirely disap- peared. The usual volcanio products, includ- ing the finest particles both solid and vapourous, were ejectel into the air to a height that no man will ever say, since for many miles round the scene of these devastating forces noon was as blaclk as night, and darkness wvas over all the land fo- 36 or 40 liours. The scale on whic lthe wvork was done was such that even the noise, the woakest nart of it. wvas heard at a distance of 2.000 'miles. The shiverino of the island produced a wave of water 100ft. sigh, which destroyed every- thing over which it swept, and left its mark on tidal registers nearly all over the world. The mere air pulso produced by tho last fearful cataclysm was stron3g enough to pass with its graduallv wvidening circle nearly thiee times round the globe. Of course there was a British ship in the middle of all this horror, for are niob British ships evetywhreo ? And surely no master marinsr has ever had such a story to tell as Captain Watson, of the Charles Ball. I hope 1 shall be forgiven for making some extracts from his story to strengthen what I have to say further on. At 3 30 on the 26th he was near the island to which we have referred, Krakatoa, in the Straits of Sunda. He heard above the ship and alil around a strange sounid as of a crackling fire, solid matter apparently, or whatever it waas, being propelled with alarming velocity to the north-east. At 5 the roaring noise continued and increased; pumice stones hot and large fell on the deck; skylights, heads, and feet had to be protected from the dovwn- poiur. After this a steady fall of a smaller kind, blinding to the eyes and speedily covering the decks three or four inches deep, and then " an in- tense blackness covered the sky and land and sea. The blinding fall of sand and stones, the intense blackness above and around us, broken only by the incessant glare of various kinds of lightning and the continued explosive roars of Krakatoa, made our situation a truly awful one." Bad as it was, it was to get worse, as the following statement in Captain Watson's own words will show:- "At 11p.m., having stood off from the lava snore, wind strong from the south-west, the island, west-north- west, 11 miles distant, became more visible, chains of fre appearing to ascend and descend between the sky asd it, wMie on the south-west end there seemed to be acontinued roll of balls of white nre; the wind, though strong, was hot and choldng, sulphurous, with a smell as of burning cinders, some of the pieces falling on as being like iron cinders, and the lead from a bottom of 30 fathoms came up quite warm. From midnight to 4 a.m. (27th) wind strong, but very unsteady, betwveen soutth-south-west and West-south-west, the same impenetrable darkness con- tinning, the roaring of Krakatoa less continuous, but more ex losive in sound, the sky one second intense blackness an the next a blaze of fire,mastheads and yard-arms studded with corposants and a peculiarly pinky iame coming from the clouds which seemed to touch the mast- headF; and yard-arms. At 6 a.m., being able to make out the Java shore, set sail, passing Eonitl' Point Lighthouse at 8; hoisted our signal letters, but got no answer. Passed Asnjer at S 30, name still hoisted, closeenough in to make out the houses, but could see no movement. of any kind; in fact, through the whole Straits we have not seen a single. moving thing of any kind on sea or land. -t. . . At 1115 there was a fearful explosion in the direction of Krakatoa, now over 30 mi:es distant. We saw a wave rush right on to the Button Island, apparently sweeping right over the soath part, and rising half-way op the north and east sides. Tfhis we saw repeated twice, but the helmsman says he saw it once before we looked. The same wave seemed also to run right on to the Java shore. At the same time the sky rapidly covered in; the wind came stron, from soath-west by south; by 11 30 a.m. we were enclosed in a darkness that might almost he felt, and at the same time commenced a downpour oE mud, sand, and Y know not what; ship going, north-east by north, seen knots per hour under three lower topsails; put out the side-lights, placed two men on the looe-out forward, while mate and second mate looked out on eitber quarter.n. emEPoyea wassnlg tae mud ott binnacle glass. WVe had seen two vessels to the north and north-west of us before the sk-y closed in, adding much to the anxiety of our poasition. At noon the darkness was so intenso tbat we bad to grope our way about the decks, and, although speaking to each other on the poop, yet could not see each other. This horrible state and downpour of mud, &c., continued until 1 30, the roarings ot the volcano and ligbtnings being somethinz fearful. By 2 p.m. we could see some of the yards aloft, and the fall of mud ceased. * . . Such darkness and time of it in general sew would conceive, and many, I dare say, would disbelieve. The ship irom truck to waterline is as if cemented; spars, sains, blocks, and ropes in a terrible mess; but, tbank God, nobody hurt or ship damaged. On the other and, how fares it with Anier, tlerak, and other little villages on the Java coast?" How this terrible story of the master _ariner emerging dimly from utter darkness only to find a land swept with the earthquake wave reminds one of a former journey:- -Ibant obscuri sola sub nocte per umbram, "Perque domos Ditis vacuss, et iaania regna V" It is easy to imagine that with eruptive forces at work on this gigantic scale millions of tons of matter, and perhaps millions of cubic miles of vapour, must have been hurled into the upper air. 'The coarser part of this matter would soot descend, as, indeed, our master mariner found; but the mere dust, or those parts of it comparable in fineness.to those particles of aqueous vapour to which I have before referred, would remain in sus- pension. It also happensthat a study of the meteoro- logical conditions of that region for the month of August shows that, independently of the eruptive enefgy of the volcano itself, we had then an addi- tional ascending force, due to the relation of this region to tbo south-east trdde. We do not know how high, in the otdinary course of business, the air brought near the equator by the trades is carried into the upper regions by the tremendous upward convection current which always exists in the equa- torial calms, the most powverful upeast shafts, per- haps, in the planet ; and still more unfortunately, we do not know for certain what becomes of it ,when it gets there. But we have evidence that its rate of motion frequently reaches 160 miles an hour, but of this I may have more to say presently. So much for facts of one order. Now for facts of another. On the 28th of Aulgust, soon after the earthquake w-ave observed by Captain Watson had reached the Seychelles, Rodriguez, the 3fauritius, and other islands in the Indian Sea, sunrises and sunsets with some of the special characteristics which we have been observ- ing in England during the last fortnight were re- corded. So different were they there, as thoy have been different here, from ordinary sunset pheno- rnena that Or. Meldrum, one of the most ptactised and competent of living meteorologists, at once ascribed them to the sun's light passing through the fine dust, resulting from the volcanic action to which we have referred, floating in the upper air. lNo wvonder that when both earth and sea and air were full of strange effects produced by thevolcanic eruptionwhich tide-gauges, barometers, and magnets had recorded, he should ascribe tho equally strange phenomena of the sky to the same cause, for the further the strange pulses were projected throu"h the solid earth and sea and air the highor into tie atmosphere would those same forces have been comnetn;t tin naat, lhn-A ,nc,' --o-.,.l,e of matter which, as Dr. D eiedru we]i Lnew, lie at the root of all sky colour. It Is to be remem- bered that Krakatoa lies near and south of the equator, and it is from near and south of the equator, at precisely the distance from the volcano that upper currents travelling with known velocities could carry these finer par- ticles, that we first hear of effects which such par- ticles could produce. N'ow whence do we get the next news I We have found these strange effects at the Seychelles. Let us assume that the same upper current goes on with roughly the same velocity, it will land us on the coasts of Brazil on the 30th or 31st; and as a matter of fact the next news came from Maranham, in the same latitude as the Seychelles, in North Brazil ; the statement being that the sun until 7 a.m. possessed a light as soft and pale as the moon's. Now if this be merely a coincidence, it surely is one of a very remarkable kind, but it is by no means all. We were face to face with the exceeding improbability that if volcanic dust were in question it should have passed right over equatorial Africa, including there- fore both the east and west coasts, without leaving any sign. It should have been seen about the same time there as in Brazil, for in an inquiry of this kind we must not expect a record of the first strange appearance. Tho gap in our informa- tion was supplied in Tlzo Times of Wednesday. On the 1st of September,on the Gold Coast, the Seychelles appearances were repeated, and we read that even It an Englishman " mistook the sun for the moon. We have now, then, got a straight trajectory of the abnormal sunsets from the Seychelles to Brazil, travelling nearly in a straight line, with the known velocity of the upper currents of our atmo- sphers. I confess that having got so far I was not surprised to find that they had been observed in Venezuela and Trinidad, practically close by, on the next evening. In Venezuela the sun was ob- served to be bluish green betweeb noon and 3 p.m. At Trinidad (Port of Spain) it looked like a blue globe, and it was noted-" After dark we thought there was a fire in the town from the brightness in the heavens." Of further information along this line there is none, but there is no lack of it along another, and we get identical appearances associated with ubnor- Mnal electrical conditions of the air which seem to have some reference to it. Professor Michie Sith, of Madrnes, noted on the 31st of August that ,is instruments,indicated positive 3lectricitg, but on the 3d of September it became negative, and then behaved in such an extraordinary manner that the readings recorded were at once reported to Sir William Thomeon. Professor Smith then goes on to say,-" From the 8th to the 14th (Sep- tember) we have bad the phenomena of a bright green sun at sunrise and sunset, the sun appearing as a rayless globe at wvhieh you could easily look. . . . On the 22d, again, two days after the electricity bad gone to positive, tle green sun re- appeared, and has now changed to a sort of golden greens. I do not say that there is any connexion between the two, but they are worth mentioning together." In Ceylon, from the Sth, the sun was observed to be green and blue at different times- the heat was modified, the sun even being blue at noon; and there was so much general absorption of the sunlight that some mornings there was no light to speak of an hour after sunrise. Our next news is from Ongole in Southern India, in lat. 15deg. N. Mr. Manly, the principal of the High School there, observed that at 4 o'clock on the afternoon oI September 10 the sunlight was of a curious pale blue. This blue gradually passed into a green and then into a yellow; and afterwvards most wonderful thing for the twilightless tropics, as Mr. Manly points out, a very deep red remained for more than an hour after sunset. The haze which covered the sky had a singular mottled appearance, and sug- gested to him clouds of snioke or dust in the upper regions of the attmosphere. On the 13th Mr. Manly describes just such a sunset as has often been recorded here since-that is to say, one lengthening the twvilight to an inordinate degree and presenting an arc of brilliant red across the sky. Our first line of sunsets vas from east to west, the second one is from south to horth. We get differences of longitude in one case, vwith no differences of latitude to speak of. In the other w-e change the latitude chiefly-Ceylon, Sdeg. N. Madras, 12deg. N.; Ongole, 16deg. N.,-and it may be noted that the lines converge to a point in latitude Gddg. S. and long S9deg. E., where as early as August 1 (the ertuption begah in MIay), the Peninsular and Oriental steamer Siam passed for four hours through large quantities of pumice, which extended as far as could be seen. Ihe ship was going 11 k-nots at the time, and the set of the sea current wa,s eastward. The lack of information from India prevents our carrying this south-to-north lire further, but we next find the appearances recorded in higher lati- tudes south and north. It was not till about the 20th of September that the same kind of sunset south of the equator began to be observed at the Cape, and it was not until tbe 9th of Novembar that they were recorded here in a much higher latitude north of the equator. It wvould be quite easy to show that from the first observations made on the 28th of August till Wed- nesday's sunset, thero has been an absolute Pro- gression of phenomena of such a nature as to point to a common and absolutely abnormal origin. The copious records made in England during the last fortnight compared with those mnado in India and Coyloh, whence we got the most careful obser- vations in the first instancej show points of simi- larity and points of divergence of singular interest, which certainly require the most careful study. With the wonderful sunsets of Tuesday and Wed- nesday fresh in my mind, I am quite prepared to say that I, for one, have never seen the like. Both ware extraordinary, weird, and baffle all descrip- tion. Such colouring I have never sef before, I allude not merely to the physical colouring, so to speak, which could be studied, and waq studied, in the spectroscope, but to the subjective colouring, which cast a green glamour over moon and cloud, if one did not take the precaution of preventing the eye being flooded by the rosy pink visible in the zenith long after sunset. Tho sunsets lately. in fact, have been so similar in some points to those observed in India, that they have shown me how admirable aro the obser- vations which were placed on record there, and how espeoially most unusnal appearances have bebn constant through them all. I havo refbrred to points of difference. So far as one can state them from the infoimation before us, they are as follows. NVe began at the end of August and early in Sep- tember with a tremendous dimming of the sun's light. " At the 8yebelles, oni the morning of the 2Utli, the sun was morb like a full moon than hhything, and at sunsat on the 28th it looked as it does through a fog or a frosty day in England." There is nothing about colour The unastronomi- cal Englishman on the Gold Coast only mistook the sun for the moon in consequence of its dimnesshe vwas not impressed by any colour. From Brazil, at the beginning of September, we are told that the sun could be looked at without the least diffi- culty, its light being as soft and pale as the moon's. Again there is nothing about colour. It is only at the end of tha east-west line that wo get the first indication of colour, and at noon. Our south-north recotd begins sixc days later (Septem- b'r 8), Colojiibo, aiud " thbt the sun rises in splendid gteen when visible, that is 1Odeg. above the horizon." This is a quotation, whatever it may mean. Now, with us, three months later, there is none of this coloration of the sun, but there is, one mighs amiost say, a development of the after twilight-lengthening phenomona, first recorded in Trinidad. These ate the facts. Do they or do they not support the viewv which ascribes the various coloured phenomens to volcanic dust ? Let us see what should have happonedif this view were well founded. The ejecta from the volcano, hoWever high they were cast into the upper ai, Wvould, in the first in- stance, have had so much coarse-grainedness about them that the light selectinlg qUalities of the finest among theim-qualities precisely similar to those possessed by those forms of aqueous vapour to whlich I drew attention at the beginning of this article-would have beei entiroly over- ridden by the coarser ones, which wvould be competent to atop light of every kind. Batavia in total darl;ness for 36 hours is as good a case of con- tinuous absorption as one need wish to have. Now, let this pall thin. The sunlight will traverse it in part, there will still. be genieral absorption, the sun will be seen white, but dim. Now, let the coarser particles fall from the upper air, leaving only behind those finer ones, thoblue and red mole- cules to which I have before referred. INeutral tint will now give way to green. WVe shall have the WVindermere effect reproduced, but by an extraordinary cause. Lot us assume at first that the quantity of red moleculeg was suli- cient to override the blue ones. At sunrise tho blue molecules from the volcano vvould be assisted in their absorption by the blue molecules of aqueous vapour always present. Tho sun would be green when it first became visible. But let the sun get high; the absorption of the aqueous vapour being then reduced in consequence of the smaller thickness of the sir as the sD rose fwould allow tho predominance of the red absorption to again assert itself, and the sun would be blue at noon, even though it rose green ; and this is exactly what happened. Now, I was careful to state at the beginning of this article that the red molecules are coarser tban the blue ones. They would, there- fore, be the first to fall from the upper air as dust, so that long after they have sufficiently disappeared to make the appearance of a blue or green sun im- possible there would be enough Aoating material in the air at as high a point to wvhich the con- vection currents can have carried it to reflect the sun's light after sunset,and to prolong the twilight in the direct ratio of its height above the earth's surface. Now, this, again, is exactly what has happened. Professor Helmholtz writes me that in the sunsets observed at Berlin on iNovember 28, 29, and 30 the reflecting material, vvhatever it may be, was about 40 miles above the earth's surface- that is to say, at the very confines of the atmos- phere, according to some text-books. It will be seen, therefore, from the above very general con- sideration of the problem not only that very fine volcanic dust wvould behave very like aqueous vapour so far as sunsets are concerned, but that the phenomena first and last, and more especially thb differences in the phonomeina between first and last, are, to a large extent, such as the hypothesis demands. Here, again, then we have evidence of a not un- important kind, in addition to that afforded by direction and dates. It has been said before that the aqueous vapour in our air is the chief cause of tho sunset colour normally. It is proper, therefore, to inquire if there is an excess of aqueous vapour at the present time. Nowv, on this question there is no higher authority than the Astronomer Rwoyal for Scotlanud, Professor Piazzi Smyth. he has been good enough to favour me with two telegrams in reply to a question I put to him, and the evidence which the spectroscope has afforded him is of the most conclusiv3 character. The rainband a band produced, as I hold. bv a ue inereasea or aiminslucO ny iu:ure information. Thus, to give one of these difficulties, Mir. Michie Smith pointed out quite early that similar phenomena were observed in Earope and Ameriua in 1831, when he imagined there was nothing volcanic to produce them, On this the interesting question arises whether it is possible to associate them with the elevation of Graham's Island in the Mediterranean in that year, as sundry dim portents seen in the last century *ere referred to an eruption of Hecla. Mluch will depend upon this, and at present I have not been able to get at the records. However the point :s ultimately settlel, the beautiful phenomena which have suggested this article will lose nohe of theit interest in the memories of those who have watched them, and if it should happen that the idea of volcamc origin is eventually justified, it is perfectly clearthat in the future the beauties of the skies wvill have a new interest attached to theni, and that they will be eagerly studied by meteorologists and utilized to acquire a knowledge of the npper curTents of the atmosphere, which, up to the present time, have all but eluded their grasp. December 6. J. NORMAN LOOKYER. special form of aqueous vapour in our air widely different from that which absorbs the blue, is now at a minimum, while the dry air band is at tremendous maxirnisnz. He adds, as a corollary, " The light, therefore, from that red haze has passed through an extra len-th of extra dry air." This puts an extra atmount of aqueoaai vatour Ps the cause of these sunsets entirely out-of the question. To dwell for a molnent oii the spectro- scopic evidence, I may add that )E do not think that it is entirely exhausted by tho result stated by Professor Smyth, and, indeed, he does not say that it is. What the appearances in the spectroscope really are is well stated by Colonel Donnelly in a note which appears in this week's Nla1tQIe re- ferring to observations made on the 28th of November, and on the 4th and t'h of the present month. The note is as folows:- " At aboat 4 o'clock on the 5th-just affter sanser-the hand Which Mr. Piazzi Smyth hals termed the ' low sun bahd' was abnormally strong,so wvas-the l.ne he calls a. Tfe lines constantly seen in the ' rain band 2 liere not visible, and Cv was very slight. Inplace of the ordinary 'rain band '-a band of. absorption shading off :'rom D towards the less refrangible end of the spectrim-tbere was a broad band of absorption -which astended nearly thtee-foarths of the way from D towards a, or nearly half-way to 0, its darkest part being at rather less than one-third of its width from D. lerom this darkest part it shaded oef in both directions. In a short time this baDd gradually nearly disappeared, the low sun band also diminishintg in intensity, while a became ettraordinarily prominnent-very dense in the middle, and slightly shaded oil at both edges. At this time the yellow aind orange of the spectrain seemed nearly to bave disappeared, the green apparently extend- ing to a considerable dittauce on the less refrangible side of D. This evening (the 5th), as Ir. Lociyer pointed out, tnere was also a strong bard of absorption between b and F. I had not remarked this on the 28th tir the 4th, and believe it is unusual or unusunlly strong." Professor Michie Smith, who observed with the spectroscope at Madras in the beginning of September, obtained results strikingly- similar, and this, of course, is another argument in favour of the view advanced by Dr. 3leldram. It will be seen, therefore, that although d 1)riori it seems difficult to imagine tlhat a sunset in London in December should owve its coloration to a volcanic eruption",English,"/mnt/lustre/rfilguei/TDA_GDA_1785-2009/1883/18831208/0FFO-1883-DEC08.xml"

The year 1883, though it Wil not be remembered for any political events of the first order of im- portance, leaves behind it a record of diversified interest. Uneasiness and anxiety are not want- ing, but there are also consoling and hopeful elements to bo taken into account, Though party spirit runs high on both sides, it has not mastered, we rmay hope, the common sense and moderation of the country. IMn. GLAMSTONE'S Government, so far as can be discovQred, retains a very large part of the popularity with which it began its career nearly four years ago. The Opposition have obviously not obtained such a hold upon the confidence of the electors as would enable them to challenge a contest with any assured hope of forming, in the event of suc- cess, a strong Administration. At the same time, there are safficieni indications of the prevalence of Conservative opinions among all classes to dis. courage rash adventures into the region of organic change. The efforts to restore the authority of the lawv in Ireland have been generally successful, though there are as yet few, if any, signs that the boons bestowed by Parliament on the tenantry have rallied the masses to the cause of orderand loyalty. On the Continent the attitude of the great military States is so far in favour of the maintenance of peace on the basis of the statUs qUo that all appear to have realized the tremendous risks of a war, for which, neverthe- less, they are incessantly sharpening their weapons. France, impatient at her enforced impotence in Europe, has sought for compensation ia policy of restlessness and aggression in lands where, though she is freed from the dangor of conflict wvith Germany, she is in contact with the ubiquitous commercial activity and the widely-ramifying poli- tical intorests of the British Empire. Wo are more fortunate in Egypt, in spitg of recent com- plications, since the task wve have there taken in hand is recognized by common consent as one whichll England only can adequately carryout. The problems presented for the time being by our Colonial and Indian policy are not without difficul- ties of their own, but they are such as must always be looked for in tho large and complex businoss of Imperial government. The rovenuo has not an- swered to the high hopes which wero formed when, two or three years ago, it was believed that the country was about to enter on a period of pros-, perity. There has been no positive decline, but the CHkucAr.oR of the Essc;Eqlns, as well as non-official critics, has pointed out a want of elasticity in the main sources of the national income. It is probable that the celculations of the Budget introdaced in April last wilU be borne out by the receipts during the remainder of the financial year, but the state of trade and industry is not such as to lead us to look for a -rapid and' startling change for the better. The fitful and tryingvicissi- tudes of the climate of these islands have once moro blighted the prospects of the agricultural classes, after encouraging the hope that at last the rancour of fortune had worn itself out. A wet and stormy winter was followed by a spring which, t'aough scourged by bitter east winds, allowed the soilto drv and met freed from weeds. There was a short spell of very fine weathar in Mlay and June, but July, the most critical month for the harvest, was for the most part cold and damp; and thougl there Nvas a decided improvement afterwards, it came too late to make the wheat crop more thar an averago one. The hay suffered at first from drought and subsequently from excessive rain ; the hops and the fruit crops, which were most promising almost to the end of the summer, *vere disastrously beaten about by the storms of August and September. On the whole, the harvest, though far above the level of the melancholy years 1879-80, was scarcely as satisfactory as in 1882. The farming interest, too, suffered severely by the repeated outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease during the summer and autumn, which were the more felt because the increase of live stock shown by the agricultural returns proved that there had been a disposition to substitute the breeding of cattle and sheep for unremunera- tive forms of tillage. How far this tendency will be checked by the recent ravages of cattle disease it is difficult to say. Meanwvhile, the de- pression of agriculture, which is still our most important industry, continues to affect every branch of our home trade, and indirectly to inter- fere with the growth of the revenue. Theso losses have not been counterbalanced by any development of foreign commerce. Both in Europe and in America manufacturing enterprise is fostered by protective duties, which exclude or hamper British trade, and of wvhich there is at present little prospect of obtaining the repeal, or even the mitigation. It is matter for congratulation in these circumstances that business of the " hand-to- " mouth " sort is fairly maintained, and that strikes and lockouts, which have threatened n suspension of operations in several important departments of industry, have been, in several cases, averted, or at all events postponed. The Ministerial changes at the close of last year, resulting from MIi. GiAnDSTOsE'S resignationI of the Exchequer, an exchange of offices between MuI. CiLDEns, LoaD Knnnaaaxv, LonD HE.L-G- ToN, and Mu. DODSON, and the admission to the Cabinet of LOBD DEBaY and SIB CnHARLEs DxLE, were completed at the beginning of January by somo important, though inferior, appointments. LoRD EnDmo>,- FnTzmArumcp became Under Secre- tary at the Foreign Office, and Ma. J. K. CR.oss at the India Office. Mtat 3.&-A, the SPrwBa's son, was made Surveyor-General of the Ordnance. Some months later, on the resignation of LoaD ROSEBERYa, Ma. fHIBBERT was appointed Under Secretary for the flome Department, and a place vas found for MIR. GEORGE RussELL as Secretary of the Local Government Board. But in its essential composition the Adminiatration remained unchanged throughout the year. It was ex- pected that the PRIME VL1STEsR would have ad- dressed his constituents, as his leading col- leagues had done, before the meeting of Par- liament, which was fixed for the 15th of February; but, in deference to urgent medical advice, the Mlid Lothian visit was postponed, and MR. GAD- STOxN went for a few weeks to Cannes, returning with renewed health and strength in time to face the toils of the Session. Political feeling was not strongly influenced out of doors by the movements and counter-movements of Parliamentary parties, and the unceasing efforts of politicians on both sides to damage their opponents by platform at- tacks produced, apparently, little effect. The battle ground of parties has, indeed, been to a great extent transferred from the ILegisla- ture to the constituencies, and the partv leaders. " emigration" from Connaught. The evident desire of the American Government to madiate between Chili and Peru was more than once frustrated by the obstinate animosities of the combatants. The pacification concluded be. tween the Chilian Government and GENO?RRA TILESIAS is still repudiated by a faction among the Peravians. The restoration of diplomatic rela- tions between this country and Mexico, which had been suspended since the execution of the EmPE- :OR1 1AxImTLi&wIA, was look-ed upon as of good augury for the settlement ef long-pending ques- tions with respect to the debt ; but these hopes have not yet been realized. Among the remarkable avents, outside the region of politics, of the past twelve months, we have to record at home the success of the Fisneries Exhibi- bition at South Kensington, equally interesting from a social point of view and on economical and scientific grounds ; the transfer of the Jaw Courts from Westminster and Lincoln's-inn to the now buildings at Temple Bar, wvhich, it may be said, have, after a brief experience, been severely criti- cised by those who usa them; the collarsa of the Channel Tunnel Scheme and of the Manchester Ship Canal project; the celebration of Snt MIOSES Mw,oTsFFio:'s entrance upon his hundredth year; the successful introduction of the Parcels Post into this country, with the promise of cheapened tele- grams and other postal improvements by MiR. Flwce=r, and the acceptance of a peerage by the POET LA.REATE. Among international affairs may be mentioned the cordial reception in the United States of the LORD CHIEF JUSTICE and other leading representatives of the English Bench and Bar, and the commemoration of the 400th anniversary of LuTrHnx'8 birth.

Tho destruction of Casamicciola, in the Island of Ischia, by an earthquake was exceeded in horror by the stupendous upheaval of Krakatoa, on the coast of Java, the most formidable volcanic eruption recorded in modern times. The explosion and the tidal wave that followed it swept away, it was computed, at least 50,000 human beings, and transformed the geography of the region of the Smnda Straits. To this event some scientific autho- rities have referred the magnificent sunsets observed all over the world in November and December, but the theory has not been universally accepted. The obituary of the year, though the list is of the average length, does not include-at home, at all events-many names of tlhe highest importance. Among English public men who have passed away may be mentioned the DuNE of llkna.otouoir, who was best known as Viceroy of Ireland under LORD BEAcoxsFIEID; LonD OVZSTO-NE, the ablest and most influential of English capitalists and the highest authority for many years on finan- cial questions; Sm GEORGE JEssEL, Master of the Rolls, by universal admission one of the greatest Judges who In recent times have sat upon the Bench in this country; M.R Liw, Lord Chancellor of Ireland, -who had a large share in the authorship and conduct through Parlia- ment of the land Act; Di.

SpormswooDF, the President of the Royal Society; Sm EDwA:D SAsm-E, one of his prede- cessors; SIR WiLLiA SIEMtES, the eminent elec- trician; and PRoFEssoR HENRy SmrTH, of Oford, a profound mathematician, but also a man of the most brilliant social gifts and the most varied in- tellectual culture. English literature has suffered severely by the early death of DIR. J. Rt. GREEN, the historian. Among other deaths may be men- tioned those- of DR. TW7ILLIAM CHsRS, of' Edinburgh, the head of the well-known publishing firm, who had received the offer of a baronetcy almost on his dying bed; Dn. MOFFAT, LiviNc- STONE'S father-in-law and friend, the patriarch of South African missionaries; PmINCEBATTRYANY, a distinguished patron of the Turf, who was sud-' denly struck down on the racecourse at New- market; LORD JusTicn DEASY,Of tbe Irish Appeali Court; COLONEL TAYLOR, M.P., for many yearsi the -I Whip" of the Conservative party in the] House of Commons; Sm SV WILLrra KNYOLL-YS, Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod; RIcHARD DO=, an artist wbose work, abounding in fancy and in humour, 'was scarcely appreciated by his contemporaries; 3Th.J.P.ComEr,the Shakapearian scholarandcritic; Dx.BEGG,oneof theleadersof the FreoeKirk-of Scotland; MR. .BoLTovY, vwhosegreat fortunes was expended on worthy public objects ; CUYn MAYNE Rsan, a favourite autbor -with two generations oF s2hoolboys; UA.PTAiN WEBB, the champion swimmer, Nvho was drowned in a mad attempt to cross the rapids below Niagara; and MnT. JoisT BrOWN, the faithful servant of the RoyalFamily. Franco has lost several men of mark. Mr. Gsbmr:rA's death a few minutes bef3re the close of the year 1882 completely transformed the political situation; but perhaps even a more important cbange was produced in the political world by the death, some months later, of the COMTE Dr CEOiRD. GEN£ERAL CniNzy survived his party chief, 1M. G"BETT.&, only a few days. M1. Elsar MARTnr, an advanced Republican, but a historian distinguished for strength and good sense, was also lost to the Republic. M. Louis VEunrLOT, the most powerful and uncompromising of Clerical and Legitimist journalists, did not live to see the claims of the House of BOurlBO:S merged in those of the Houas of OanIAN s. 11. LrNor=xNT'sdeath has left a gap in the ranks of Oriental scholars. In art M1. GusTAvE fDod ; and in letters, M. LABOULAVE, Md. VacTron LsA-DrIB, and M1. JULES SANDEAU; in soience, 31. PLAT.EAU; and in society, the ColTr DE LAGRAosG, havo left places vacant which it will not be easy to fill. Germany has mourned for RaicADD WAG-NED, whose genius as a composer none wil now deny, even thotugh bis claims to have called into existence the "1 music of " the future " may be questioned; for FjoTow, a popular musician, but of far lower calibre; and for the veteran scholar Di-NDoar. KARL AI.x, who may be called the founder of modern Socialism, has also passed away. Russia has lost not only PRINCE GORTCHAXo;FF, so long the im- personation of MIuscovite foreign policy, but, at a much earlier age, IvAN TunGUgsxEsr, the most powerful imaginative writer whom Slavonic literature can boast. The death of another novelist, flnsxi Co-SCIESCE, who had achieved more than- local distinction, has deprived the struggling language and literature of Flanders of one of its few celebrated names. Italy and the wholo musical world has had to lament the most famous of tenora, MI.Ao. Greece has had to record the death of M. CoumouNnounos, a party leader and a Minister of much experience and influence. In India, the loss of Sin SALA JUNo, perhaps the ablest of native statesmen, has been deplored alike by natives and by Anglo- Indians. In Japan, IwkrxumA, an earnest advocate of progrosa and well known in Burope as a diplo- matist, was prematurely cut off. Tim STxsE LzEGATION.-Prince Prsdang, vho, recently presented his letters of recall to Her Majesty as Siamosehiinisterfrom theCourt of St. James's, has left London, with his suite, for the Siamese Legation at PAris, where he intends to take up his Dcrantilt r, de=c. as well as the rank and file, feel themselves called upon to defend their position and assail their enemies at public meetings, in the newspapers, and in periodical publications. An incessant fire is thus kept up out of doors as well as in Pacliament and popular attention is no longer fixed only upon the measures immediately prosecuted by the Go- vernment. The PRimE MIlfisTrEa, in the midst of the labours of the Session, encouraged his party in a, powerful speech deliv ered at the opening of the Nlational Liberal Club; MAL. CsuA.BEBLAIN, both before and afterwards, has boldly "' carried the wvar " into Africa," denouncing those 1 who toil ' not, neither do they spin," with special application to the peers and individually to LoPD SAIsBunY. On the other band, the Conservative chiefs were not IESS ener- getic and aggressive. LOaD SALISBaURY and Sm STAFFORD NORTacOTE, as well as others of less eonspicuous and responsible position, seized every opportunity of placing their views before the country. It was probably deemed prudent to disperse by a striking manifestation of concord the rumours of rivalry and strife to which Losr DRs DOLrH CnuRcsnL lhad given colour by a letter published in our columns soon after Easter. Both on the Liberal and on tho Conservativo side the exigencies of party mastored any differences of opinion and personal jealousies. It was noted that this Session was the first since the general election in whicDh the Government had lost none of its members through a disagreement on matters of policy, for LO-RD ROSEBERY's resignation, avowedly to facilitate the Ministerial arrange- ments, was not to be compared with the suc- cessive losses of the MTAP.QUIs of LANSDOWNE, the DuxE of ARGYLL, MtR. FORSTER, and MnR. BlsCBT. No sooner waas Parliament proroguned than the flood-gates of platform oratory wera opened 'wider than ever. Both parties sesmed to feel that the next Session would be a critical one. The Conser- vative Opposition assailed the whole policy of Ilinisters at home and abroad, denouncing espe- cially the conduct of alfairs in Ireland, Egypt, and South Afria. Tha Liberals believed they had a good defence to offer on all the points attacked, bat a purely defensive position is always imore or less a weak one in politics; and it was felt that the time had come to lay aside secondary projects of legislation and to bring forward promninently mea- sures which might be supposed to address them- selves more povwerfully to popular conviction and sentiment. The London Municipality Bill, wyhich had been thrust aside during the Session by tlh Corrupt Practices Mill and the Agricultural Hold- ings Bill, was not deemed strong enough for the main pillar of a policy leading, perhaps, to an ob- stinate Parliamentary conflict and an appeal to the constituencies. A conference of the repre- sentatives of Liberal organizations was lIeld at Leeds, at wvhich it wvas resolved, in spite of the objections urged by those interested in the aboli- tion of the old Corporation of London and of the existing administrative authorities in the counties, to irisist that the Government should give prece- dence next year to the promised nieasore of Parliamentary reform. The cry ofFranchise " first " wvas generally taken up by Liberal poli- ticians, and appeared to have the approval of Liberal gatherings. The advocates of the other measures were pacified by the assuranco that the Session wvould not be devoted to the extension of the suffrage only. The attitude of the Conser- vatives was one of "cautious observation," a policy comme6ded to his friends subsequently by Sm STrIFORD oNOnTICOTE, but not one calculated to produce a striking effect upon public opinion. Even the more energetic spokesmen of the Oppo- sition, LoRD SiissvusLY in England and Mit. GeBsox in Scotland, contented themsslves with suggesting difficulties and demanding that the whole of the Government, scheme should be disclosed before a decisive judgment was demanded I upon it from Parliatnent and the country. At the Guildhall banquet on Lerd Mayor's Day the PRJME Minasnra ridiculed the precision of the current rumours with realect,go.the order. and thte character of coming legislation, but MP. CA'M- Bm,RLAn, speaking not long after at Bristol, left no doubt that the matter waS practically settled. Declaring his personal preference for manhood suffrage, he insisted that the Lib.ral party was pledged, at the least, to the introduction of household suffrage in the counties throughout the whole of the United Kingdom, and that the work was too weighty and difficult to be postponed to any other. Redistribution, he con- tended, must be left to be dealt with in a later measure. LonD racRTMGToN, in a speech delivered immediately afterwards at Manchester, was under- stood to throw some doubts on the points which MA. CnElBRLAis treated as incontestable. He pointed out that there were many practical diffi- culties to be surmounted which the Leeis Con- ftrence had not considered, that the inclusion of Ireland in the Bill would excite Liberal as well as Conservative resistance, that the abolition of the property qualiEcations in counties would be unpopular, and that the separation of the franchise question from that of redistribution might, as in 1S66, endanger the whole scheme. From this hesitating attitade the ScECrcTARY for WAB ap- parently reeeded in a subsequent speech at Accring- ton. At all events, the advanced section of the Liberals did not alter their chos3n line of policy. in which many politicians of the moderate school, such as Mal. GsO2CHE and Ma. FoEsrxt, seemed quite willing to follow them. A more lively spirit has been imparted lately to Conservative criticism by LoRD RAmo.r-t (' CausseniL's able, but very independent, speeches at Edinburgh. The Reform controversy, though it produced no popular excitement, was the chief political topic of domestic interest in thelatter half of the year. At the beginning of the Recess Mai. Gsnsro.Xr, exhausted by the labours of the Session, went, in company wsith Mu. TExxvYsoT and others, for a cruise round the ccast of Scotland, and thence to the Baltic, in one of SIB DoNxi. CunraIr's steamers. At Copenhagen, the E.aPBRoa and Esierrss of RussiA, and the KiNG Of GP.EEcE, who, with the PRLXCEss of WALES and her children, formed part of the family circle at the Danish Court, visited the Pembroke Castle, and an interchange of com- plimentary speeches took place, on which some political gossips, abroad and at home founded absurd conjectures of Anti-German alliances. Little attention, however, was paid to these speculations, which the course of events as well as the reason of the case show,ed to be wholly unfounded. hile SIP. STArFFORD NORTCOTE undertook a political pilgrimage through Ulster and North Wales, LoRD SALisnuxy denounced the policy of the Government, foreign and domestic, in an article published under the title of "Disintegration" in the Qcarterly Review. A more practical and less indefinite issue was brought conspicuously forward by him in a paper " On the Housing of the Poor." The evils of overcrowding and of unwholesome dwellings had been pointed at, not for the first time, as a public scandal by religious and philanthropic workers among the poor, but LoaD SA-aSBURY'S statement of the case commanded the attention of statesmen. The samne tone of moderation and caution has not been observed throughout the dis- cussion. MaB. CHoxaxEPLATS in taking up the question made it a text for an attack on the land- owning classes. on whom he proposed to throw the charge of removing insanitary dwellings and re- p;acing them by good houses built under municipal di,custion. LORD SAiTESBUBY and others prac- tically acquainted with the condition of the poor protested against this method of proceeding, not only as unjust, but as fatal to voluntarv effort and the working out of natural remedies. The demand, however, was taken up by the advo- cates of municipal reform for London, who, accepting the fact that the existing law was strong enough if put in iorce, contended that the fault lay with tha vestrymen, and that a change could only be hoped for by placing local administration in other hands. The more drastic remedies suggested for evils deplored by all -were looled upon with the greater alarm and suspi- cion by moderate men inasmuch as during the year a Socialist propaganda, advocating the doc- trines of " Land N>atioaalization " developed in america by M1n. HENrY GEoRGn, had been active. At the same time, the popular dis- I trust of State interference has been much wreak- ened, as was snowvn by the absence of opposition to the extension of official control and pa- tronage under the Bankruptcy Act, and the confi- dance wvith wlich 3Lu. CmAsuErAnz has put for- ward a scheme for gotting rid of unseawvorthy I ships by limiting the right of shipowners and shippers to protect themselves by insurance against loss. 'he by-elections of the year afforded few oppor- tunities of testing the movements of public opinion. In Ireland they wont almost without exception in Mrn. PAscNaLn's favour. Whigs, ad- vaniced Liberals, and moderate Rome Rulers had to give way to his candidates in the South. In Ulster the Orange revival generally aided the Con- servativEs, tnougb on the appointment of the Attorney-General, MIa. Poarax, as Master of the Rolls, insuccessionto Smw E. SULLivAIc, who became Chancellor, the SoLcliToR-GCazxBaLseems likelyto be returned without a contest in the county Derry. In Great Britain gains and lo3ses were pretty evenly balanced. Liberal and Conservative seats were in most cases retained. The Rutland contes. seemed to show tbat the farmers had not been won over by Liberal legislation. At 3Ian- chest er a Radical and an advocate of Rome Rule for Ireland was discountenanced by the local organization, and his Conservative opponent se- cared an easy victory. Later in tho year the Opposition captured a Liberal seat at York and the 31inisterialists a Conservative seat at Ipswich. It was reported early in the year that Sm HIsav BtA?sED was unwilling to faca the fatigues of another Session in the Speaker's chair, and the choice of his successor, for whom a Government with a large majority l ould, of courss, be ablo to secura the nomination, -was awaited with much interest. A few weeks ago it becam3 known that the offer had been made informally to Ma. GoscuEx, who declined it on the ground of his imperfect eyesight, and that the lawv officers of the CRo;vs also wvould have been nominated if tney had wished it. The choice of the Government fell finally npon Bal. ARTruR PrEL, M.P. for Warwvick, the youngest son of the great statesman, who had fliled some minor offices under IB. GL^AsroN-M, and had even been appointed "Whip " in 1873, thoughl he had never discharged the duties of that post. It bas been rumoured that the Oppo- sition will pat forward a candidato against MB. PEEL, not with any hope of presert success, but by way of a caveat against Bm. PEEL'S continued oc- cupation of the chair, should fortune give them the means of ousting him. Early in January the authority of the lawr in Ireland was powerfnUy vindicated in many different directions. 31a. EEALY and MBI. D&viTT, with one of their associates, were committed to prison by the Queen's Bench for contempt of Court, having refased to engage not to repeat language provocative of a breach of the peace. IM. O'BRuEN, editor of Uziited Ireland, was indicted for a libel charging LoaD SPENcnri with having bribed juries to secure convictions for murder, but in this case a conviction vas defeated by a disagreement of the jury. MA. O'BaruN, while his trial was pend- ing, was elected 2f.P. for Mallow, obtaining a large majority over the then SorzciToa-GxExurA. Mi . HsAix, who resigned his seat for Wexford at I tb*leginno£ hinimuaQpjfoQQ-fo.a During these distant adventures the position of France in Europe has been in many wvays an uneasy one. Though it was officially stated on both sides, from time to time, that there was no canso of quarrel with Germany, much ill-feeling and recrimination found vent in the press, and culminated in the scandalous treatment of K'NG ALFONSO in Paris. The German complaints of French malignity appeared to be fully justified when the KIxG of SPALN was singled out, on passing through Paiis in September, for insult, because he had accepted at Berlin an honorary colonelcy of an Vhlan regiment. Tho Ministry showed decided coolness towards the KiNa, but the insolent violence of a mob, which hooted the Royal visitor on his arrival and when calling on PRESIDENT GRE-vy, forced on them an ungracious and lame apology. The result was that Spain followed the example of Italy in connecting herself wvith the Austro-German Alliance, a fac-t which soon aftcr was emphasized by the tour of the German CRowN PRi:NE through the Iberian und Italian peninsulas, taking in not only the Courts oE Knea AINo.Nso and KING HUMBERT, but the Vatican as well. It may be re- marked further that France had rightly or wrongly, aroused the jealousy of Portugal by her proceed- ings on the Congo and the Niger, and of Switzerland by a military demonstration in Savoy. Thus the isolation of France on the Continent was almost complete. The retirement of MI. CH ALLEMEL-LACOUIR from the French Foreign Office, where be was succeeded by M. FERRY himself, waA rendered inevitable by an impracticable temper which nullified cDnsiderable abilities. During his tenure of office the breach with the Vatican, as well as with Germany and her allies, slowly but steadily widened, and the aliena- tion of Roman Catholic feeling from the Republic was hardly compansated at home by the increased influence secared-unfairly, as the Moderate party contended-through the removal of magistrates distrusted as attached to former r,gimnes. M. VAnDD1NToN has, for some months back, repre- sented France in this country, perhaps with less susceptibility to compromise than a statesman not of English blood. The errors of the French Govern- ment have crippled the Republican caueo in tho other Latin States. In Spain, during the greater part of the year, the SAGASTA Ministry have re- tairied ofice by the support of a coalition ; a threat- ening Socialist movement in the south came to uothing ; military risings, supposed to have origi- nated in the ambitious designs of the exiled leader Sz&On ZORRILLA, were promptly repressed, and the KINa's popularity was augmented beyond all expectation by the discourteous folly of the Parisian mob. The Mlinistry lately constitnted under Szon HE.RREai is pledged to universal suffrage, but may find difficulties in carrying out that hazardous policy. 3Meanwhile, Spanishdiplo- macy has not only effected a rapprochemnent with Germany, but has laid the foundation of acom- mercial agreement with England, advantageous, it may be hoped, to both parties. In Italy, "- a ' conformity of diplomatic action " with Germany and Austria was announced, and the extravagances of the Irredentists were disavowed. A Ministerial reconstructionhas separated SGoonO DEPIETIS froM his more advanced colleagues and drawn him into an alliance with the Constitutional politicians of the Right. TheLeftwould be aggressive if it dared, but the position of the Government has been not only strengthened by the improvement in the finances and by diplomatic successes, but by the factious schisms and quarrels of the Opposition. There is no change to be noted in the attitude of the Vatican towards the Italian Monarchy, though towards otherPowera LxoXIo . has been eminently conciliatory. The PoPE's desire to employ the in- fluence of the Church in repressing revolutionary tendencies has been proved by his intervention in Ireland to deter the clergy from giving active aid to the Land League party. Ml. ERRINGTON'S functions at Rome remain still undofined, but through him and others the PoPE ia now kept informed of the real stato of Irish affairs. This dis- position has naturally smoothed the way for a re- conciliation with Germany, on which the seal was balieved-perhapsprematurely-to bo set by thevisit of the CROWN PRtIO S. PRiNCE Bisx3cE had alregdy taken a decisive step towards the resumption of friendly relations with Rome by carrying in the Prussian Landtag a measure repealing the famous -' FALx Laws," and though no actual working com- promiso bas beon agreed on, it is plain that the C.usA.NrFoR's wish is to govern henceforward not in spite of, but with the help of the Vatican. His tendency is to rely more and more in the Imperial Parliament upon the Centres, of whom the Clericals form an important section, against the Socialists, the Advanced Liberals, and the Separatist factions. The Reichstag has complied, though somewhat sullenly, with tbe EMPEROR's urgent request to vote the Estimates for two years, but has resisted more than ono of PRINcE BrsirARcK's favourito mea- aures. The system, however, which is popularly known as " State Socialism," has by no means been abandoned. The foreign policy of the Government has been vigilant, but not restless. A better under- standing with Russia has prevailed since the visits paid by M. DZ GiERs, PRINCE GonRTcmxorr's successor, to Berlin, Vienna, and Rome early in the year. Austria has needed aU the sup- port that Germany could give her,. as weU as relief from Russian pressure",English,"/mnt/lustre/rfilguei/TDA_GDA_1785-2009/1883/18831231/0FFO-1883-DEC31.xml"
1883-12-31,"18831231","krakatoa",2,", to enable her to cope with grave internal troubles. Scandals showing the existence of much political corruption, :socialist eonspiracies and prosecutions, streeb fiots and strikes, disquieted the Cisleithan States, while in Hungary the ill-feeling against the Jews, a peren- nial source of social trouble, culminated during the trial of the Tisza-Lisslar murder case. The charges against the Jews of having sacrificed a Christian. girl at Passover in the previous year wero proved to be of the flimsiest kind, depending almost wholly on the evidence of the son of one of tho prisoners, who, partly by threats and partly by promises, was induced to swear to a monstrous story. Thc whole oasa broke down on the trial, but the populace throughout the country, and oven in Russia, were furious at the escape of the Jews. A still more serious cause of disturbance in the Trans- leithan kingdom arose out of the hostility of the Croatians to 3agyar rule. The extension of Hun- garian authority was openly resisted, martial law had to be proclaimed, and riots put. down by mili- tary force, The BAN's resignation showed the sympathy in high places with the Slavonic claims, and even at Pcsth the necessity for concessions has been recognized. At Vienna, and, indaed, at Berlin also, the im- portance of seeking a counterpoise for Russian influence in tho Balkan peninsula was clearly seen. Close relations have been established with the Servian kingdom, and KING BMsA'S visit to Austria and Germany in the autumn was generally regarded as significant. A succesful attempt to omancipate the Orthodox Church in Servia from Russian control had alienated KING MiLAw and his subjects from their former protectors, and Servian suspicion had been whetted by the marriage of a claimant to the Servian throne with a daughter of the PRaNc of MONTENEGRO. The latter Stato has been conspicuously patronized by Russia and specially favoured by the POiTE, its hereditary foe, in the suppression of the Albanian insurrection. Russia was the more tempted to lean on Montenegro since in Bulgaria and Eastern Roumelia her power was on the wane. In the latter province, as well as in P.RiNc ALEANDER'S dominions, the interference of the Russian officials was bitterly resented, but in both countries the quarrel was outwardly composed, though Bulgaria has got rid of the Russian members of the Cabinet. Roumania has shown jealousy of Austria and dis- appointment at her exclusion from the Danubian Conforence held in London early in the year. The relations of the Balkan States might have been more seriously troubled by the efforts to bring about a revolution in Serviain the autumn,but after KING MILAN's display of vigour in dealing with impracticable factions, the energy, tempered by clemency, of his measures directed against an abortivo rising merited and secured success. The foreign policy of Russia, however, was less active than in former years, which was in part due to the domestic difficulties of the Government, and in part to the reticulated restraints of German diplo- macy. Nihilist arrests and prosecutions were re- ported from time to time ; but social terrors were visibly abating. On New Year's Day it was an- nounced that the long-delayed coronation of the EMPEROR and EsPRrzss would be performed at Mosco-w in May. A magnificent national and inter- national ceremonial was organized, with extraordi- nary precautions agsinst outrage, and was success- fully carried through. The splendour of the scene was, perhapi, unequallod: every important State in the civilized world, every province and town of the Empire of the Czars, was represented in the brilliant gatbering " before the sacred " relics of the Kremlin," and for the populace there was a carnival of medinaval magnificence and lavishness. Though no warning signs broke the monotony of congratulations, few could forget the events that had gone before, and many regretted that the opportunity had not been seized for makmg advances towards constitutionalism and neutralizing revolutionary ideas. The Scandinavian kin2doms are less connected than they once were with Russia, and their difficulties aro unlike hers. In Denmark a ohronic struggle between the Throne andtheParliamentary Radicals has become acute. A far more formidable question of the same kind has arisen in Norway, where the Ministers have been not only censured but impeached and impri- soned, and the KING personally denounced. Sw8- den, however, remains loyal, tranquil, aud pros- perous. Tho ssme may be said of Holland, the wealth and progress of which wore strikingly illustrated at the Amsterdam Exhibition. It is, nevertheless, remarkable that in all these countries, as well as in Belgium, some anxiety was inspired by Socialist demonstrations and organizations, which, however, came to nothing. Apart from Egyptian affairs, the Turkish Empire has not come prominently before the world during the past tsvelve months. The SuLTAN's peculiari- ties of charactor have been an obstacle to progress, aRd no confidonce is felt in the stability of any MIinistry or policy dependent on his will. He has been gravely disquieted by the rumours of religious revolutions in the Mussulman world, and especially by the success of the MAu1r in the Soudan, but he is not more inclined to remove the grievances of his Christian subjects. The agitation in Armenia has not subsided, and no attempt has been made to carry out the long-promised reforms. Ve owe, however, this much to Turkey, that she has not attempted to complicate the Egyptian problem in Egypt by interference in the character of Suzerain. The attitude of the Eunropean Powers towards tho English occupation of Egypt might have been described at the opening of tho year as one of acquiescence tempered by szpectanc. ARABi and his associates had just been deported to Ceylon and LORD GRANVILLE bAd announced that this country would not re-establish thu Dual Control. The EZyDtian Government having SwCDt away tho Control, and in other respects created at-abu7a rass, LOBD DulPsRnw, assisted by a number of able Englishmen, proceeded to elaborate a scheme of administrative and social reforms, including the germs of a natioial representative system. These recommendations, set forth in a remarkable despatch laid before Parliament in the spring, were adopted without demur by the KEEDnIE, and when, after a'brief visit to England, the British Am- bassador returned to Constantinople, he left affairs at Cairo in an encouraging state. It was ap- parently agreed on all hands that though Egypt was to be educated for self-government, it was impossible for the present to dispense with British predominance or to withdraw the British troops. The changes in administration, in the judiciary, and the army, as well as the development of poli- tical institutions, must be necessarily slow. SIn EVELYN WOOD had undertaken the organization of the army and BATER PAsiA. that of the gendarmerie. Sm AUCIxazcUD CoLvIN became " Financial Adviser " to the KHEDIvE, but was succeeded. not long afterwards by MEn. VINCENT. SIR EDWARD MALET, the Consul-General, was ap- pointed M1inister at Brussels,andhisplacowas filled, with increased powers and dignity, by SIR EVELYN BARaxG, previously Financial Member of Council at Calcutta. The Bedonins who had murdered PROFEssoa PALmEiL and his companions were brought to justice in January,. and some months later the authors of the Alexandria conflagrations were convicted and punished in spite of an outsry raised in Parliament bv LOaD RAIDOLP1- COuRcuiLL. The couniitry, under British guidance, was progressing, though, indeed, slowly, and in spite of some outcry at the cholera epidemic in the summer the acquiescence of Europe was still indisputable. But the withdrawal of the British troopa was loudly called for during the autumn by some advanced Liberals in this country, and at the Guildball banquet on Lord MIayor's Day the Px.m IVISTErn announced that their number would bo largely reduced. But before this order could be earried out an unexpected catastrophe in the Soudan enforced a reversal- of policy. The re-conquest of the Soudan from the " MAnADI," a pretended pro- phetor reformer of Islam,who during the troubles at Cairo had become supreme throughout the vast and vague regions south of Khartoum, wvas attempted in March, when COLONEL Hscxs, a retired Anglo-Indian officer, was despatched as Chibf of the Staff, and with the Egyptian troops achieved, a little later, a victory over the MAniDi's forces, which, however, -was not, as had been 'hoped, decisive. Hions PAsHA subsequently became Commander-in-Chief and in the autumn advanced again upon the centre of the ManiD's strength at Obeid. For weeks nothing was known of his movements, but at length the news reached Kihartoum that the whole of the Egyptian army, wvith the General and the other European officers,- bad been surrounded and destroyed by the rebels. The consternation at Cairo was profound, for not long before some troops moving near Suakin, the post on the Red Sea through which intercourse with Khartoum was kept up, had suffered heavy loss, the British Consul, CA1- TAIN MoNCrIEFF, having fallen among -others. The remnants of HICoS PAeiA's force were, for the most part, drawn together in Khartoum by another English officer, though some outlying posts were left to themselves. It was doubted whether Khar- toum could hold out, and the difficulty was increased by the folly of the Governor of Suakin, who sacrificed some hundreds of his best soldiers in a mismanaged sortie. The British Government, which had at once countermanded the withdrawal of the troops from Cairo, advised the KHaDIva not to attempt the re-conquest of the Soudan, but, having relieved the invested posts and finally fixed a hold upon the Red Sea coast and, the Nile Valley as far as Wady Halfa, to maintain the defensive. It was intimated tbat, though neither British nor Indian soldiers would be sont out, a fleet would in case of need be ordered to Alexandria. The KuEDivE's Government, meanwhile, has despatched BAKERI PAiSH± to Suakin with a native force under strict orders to observe caution. The reports of the -MAuDI's position aro conflicting, but down to the present no important movement has been made on either side. These stirring events have partially diverted attention from the Suez Canal controversy. The action of the British ship- owners who protested against the exactions of the Canal Company early in the year resulted most unexpectedly in the provisional agreement which Parliament and public opinion so emphatically dis- approved, and whicfi the Government had to with- draw. During the autumn, negotiations were privately renewed between Ml. DE LEsssEPs and the shipowners, the Government holding aloof. The President of the Canal Company visited the chief commercial and shipping centres- Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle-and, finally, after a series of interviews in London, the bases of an agreement were arranged, which differed from that previously proposed by the Government in many important points. No public money was to bo advanced in lieu of the £8,000,000 the Government had been ready to grant ; a second canal was to be cut at the ccst of the Company; this country was to be represented on the goveriing council not only by the official directors, but by seven delegates of the ship- owners, forming also a -onsultative body in London. At the same time, it .as urged that the gravest objections to the Mlinisterial arrangement 'nad not been removed. The administration of tho old Canal was still to remain French, and that of the new one was to be French also. M. nD LxssePs declared that during his lifetime and that of his son the Canal would never cease to be French. The claim of the company to a monopoly was asserted as strongly as ever, and the demand that the shares held by the English Government should be givenI full voting power was rejected. On the other hand, the Egyptian Government have ontered a protest beforehand against any altaration in the status of the Canal Company under tho existing concession without the KEEDIVE's assent. The Government of India has been favoured by many of the principal conditions of prosperity and peace. The finances aro in a healthy state, and neither war nor famine threatens any unusual drain. LORD RirON, however, involved himself early in the year in a conflict of unprecedented bitterness with tho non-official European inhabi- tants. MIB. ILBuRT, tho Legal Member of Coun- cil, introduced & Bill, which came-to bear his name, giving native magistrates up eountry, in contra. vention of tho compromise settled in 1872, the power to try Europeans on criminal charges. The change, which was origiually recommended as a modest administrative reform, was afterwards en- larged in its scope, *nd was put forward as a fultilment of the promiso of " equal rights " held out to natives by the QuENm'S Proclama- tion. The non-official Europeans, who sinza tho development of tea planting, railway construction, and other forms of private enterprise have be- come an important element, protested agninst the withdrawal of their acknowledged right to be tried by " their peers" in deference to a sentimental and theoretical claim affecting only a limitod number of native civil servants and in doEance of the preponderant opinion of the Anglo-Indian official class. A powerful organization was established in India to opposo the Ilbert Iill and was supported at home by the vast majority of rotired Indian officials. It turned out also, in spite of maladroit attempts to disguise the truth, that the opinions of the officers consulted by the Governmnent were. by nearly four to one. in 'favour of withdrawing tho Bill, while of its nomninal supporters aU save a few recommended a compromise. Unluckily, not only Europeanbut native feelings had been excited. 2tB. BiGnT and other advanced Liberals, without taking the pains to master the details of the measure, advocated it onEnglish platforms as " Justice to India," and the spokesmen of the Government, bDth in India and at home, declared that it would be prosecuted unflinchingly. The opposition of the Europeans did not abate, and, indeed, LoP/D RiFoN has met at Calcutta with more signal marks of disfavour among his own countrymen than any Viceroy since the extinction of the Company. At Bristol, towards the close of the year, LoRD N?oRTHBRoor, announced, in terms which were generally misconstrued, that a com- promise vwould be proposed. The limitations suggested were not regarded as sufficient by the Anglo-Indian community. and, finally, when the consideration of the measure bad been adjourned tiUl after Clhristmas, anuimderstanding -was entered into with the opponents of the measure, by which Europeans objecting to be tried by a native mnagistrate might demand a jury of whom the majority should be non-natives. This arrange- ment entails some administrative inconveniences and practical anomalies, but it protects the Europeans against injustice and secures the Go- vernment such crodit as may be given to the passing of the Bill thus altered. This controversy has overshadowed all other topics of Indian politics during the year. It is important, however, to note the Bengal Rent Bill, introduced to give the ryots "security of tenure," and generaUy to place them in the position of Irish tenants under the Act of 1870. It has been apprehended, also, that the reforming spirit of the Government may be about.to carry it into a campaign against what is inexactly caUed " the Church Establishment in India, but it is not certain that any decision has been arrived at on this Doint. Among the Colonial dominions of tho CROWN, those in South Africa are still the cause of the greatest anxiety. Tho Cape Colony, after some ex- perience of the difficulties of an ambitious policy, has prevailed on the Imperia] Government to resume the administration of Basutoland. Natal has been disquieted by the results of CETYwAvo'S restoration in Zululand. Against this measure the Zulus rose under UsinEpu, defeating and driving out their former King, who took refuge with the British Resident in the " Reserve," but who has not resigned the hope -of ultimatetriumph. The future of the Zulus is wrapt in doubt, and the position of the Natal colonists is in the meantime an anxious one. The situation is not more assured in the Transvaal, where the Boers are iu conflict with the Bechuanas on the west and the Swazis on the east. 'Tho native difficulty is probably at the root of the active measares which the Boers are now taking to procure the revision, or rather the abrogation, of the Convention of Pretoria. The attempts of the Transvaal Boers to get the mastery over the Bechuanas and to secure not only the lands of the native tribes but the control of the trade routes from the Cape to the interior were warmly discussed in Parlia- ment when the revision of the Convention was mooted. It was at firat thought advisable to send out a Coommissioner from this country, afnd LoPD RAt', a Dutchman by birth, was selected ; but the Boers preferred to send their delegates here, and in the autumn PBaESIDENXT KRUGER, with two others, laid the demands of the Govern- ment at Protoria before the Colonial Office. It is understood that the Boers demand the restora- tion of their complete independence, as secured by the Sand River Conventions ; but LonD DannY'sanswer has not yet been made known. In the Australasian Colonies we have to record the vigorous movement of active and intelligent communities. Victoria, which claims tho un- disputed hegemony of these youthful States, was happily freed at tho opening of the year from chronic political troubles by the defeat of the O'LorGImN Ministry aDnd an " administrative " coalition between the Constitutionalists under MnR. SEavIcS and the Radicals under MB. BaiaY. It was acknowledged that the old political issues were worn out, and that a larger policy would be welcomed on all hands. AYsimilar spirit was found to prevail in the neighbouring Colonies, and LORD NoRM,ANBsY'S reference to Australian Federation, in his speech to the Parliament at Moelbourne in July, met with a hearty response. Queensland had already set the match to the train by the unautho- rized annexation of a part of the coasts of New Guinea. Colonial opinion had been much excited by rumours that France and Germany were about to assertclaima to the sovereignty of New Guinea, the New Hebrides, and other islands not far distant from Australia, and in April the Queensland Government, as a measure of precau- tion, sent an officer toPort Moresby to declareNew Guinea a part of the dominions of the QuEan. The act was disavowed by the Colonial officials, but in reply zo arguments strongly urged on him by delegates from all the Colonies, LoinD lmuBy pointed to confederation as a possible solution, especially with respect to New Guinea. The Colonies took him, rather unexpectedly, at his word. The germ of a federal convention had been already developed in negotiations for an intercolonial postal system, and public sentiment in all the Colonies was fully prepared to take a more decided step. A conference of the Govern- menta of all the Australasian Colonies was convoked at Sydney, and adopted a series of re- solutions of the highest importance, not only calling upon the mother country to annex New Guinea and the New Hebrides, but to forbid any further extensions of non-English power in the Pacific south of the Equator. At the same time the outlines of a loose system of federal organi- zation were sketched and submitted for approval to the Imperial Government. No such large questions have been raised in the Canadian Dominion, where the chief incident in the history of this year was, the retirement of the Governor-General, the MIsquis of LoENE, and the nomination of the MARQuiS of LANSDOWXE as his successor. The latter, a well-known Irish landlord, was violently denounced by some of the American- Irish agitators, but there was no response to these brutal appeals in Canada. Politics in the United States have been unusually torpid, though there has lately been a revival of life as the Presidential contest of 1884 comes into view. The tariff has been the principal topic before the eountry. Just at the close of the last Session of Congress in MIarch the Republican majority, knowing that the Demo- crats, .who had been victorious at the previous Fall elections, would command the next Congress, strained every nerve to carry a ` revised " tariff, which, with some ostensible concessions, would really secure the protective system. The Demo- crats might have acquiesced in this arrangement if they had not suffered so much at the recent elee- tions, when GENERAL BuTLER, among others, was badly beaten in AMassachusetts, that they saw need for a new cry. In the choice of the Speaker of the Rouse of Representatives the Democratic majority threw over Ma;. RA:NDAI and the Pennsylvania Protectionists, and declared for tariff reform. On shat issue it seems probable the next Presidential contest will be fought out. The foreign relations of the UTnion have been even more devoid of in- terest. The Irish-Americans, irritated by the punish- ment inflicted on their allies at home, have been unusually virulent, and the pressure of the Irish vote has Compelled PxESIDcNzi AnxTHus's Govern- ment to Drotest against the alleged "pauper gban, 'whera a Liberal vacancy had been created, Don after his release, and was returned by a suffi- cient number of votes over the Conservative candi- date, leaving the Liberal with a mere handful at the bottom of the poll. But these politieal develop- ments were preceded by events of a more stirring sort. While the authors of the Lough Mask and the Castleisland murders were expiating their guilt with their lives, the detective poliea in Dublin, who had been brought to a high state of efficiency under MIR. JEiEr-zsoN, and who had got hold of a clue by means of the secret inquiries held under the Crimes Act, suddenly swooped down upon and captured a number of men sus. pected of complicity in criminal organizations. The examination bef3re the magistrates at Kilmainham inculpated the prisoners not only in connexion wi.sth the attempt on M1n. FIELD'S life, but with tie Phoenix Park tragedy. Two or three informers wera produced, whosa revelations, especially in re- gaTd to a series of abortive attempts to marder Mx. FORSTER, were startling enough, but they were all thrown into the shade by the transler from the dock to the witness-box oE J.ArEs CAimy, the most important personage among the prisoners, a well-Imown Nationalist, a devout Roman Catholic, and a Councillor of the City Corporation. CAREY had baen, as it proved, the centro of a murdoroas conspiracy,;taking the name of " The Invincibles ;" the Pheenix Park atroeity was planned and in a measure accomplished by him, the aetual assassins being among the men in custody. Before the magistrates, and afterwards at tho trial, CAnEY gave au elaborate and unrefuted account of the maariner in which the seheme for the " romoval" of M1R. Buaru, the Undelr Secretary, was carried out, affirming that LORD F nREDEnnCc CAVmNDISE was unknown to the murderers, and became a victim through his accidental presence on the scene. He identifed BRADY, K.ExL, CunLEY, and others as concerned in the affair, and sufficient corroborative evidence was forthcoming to justify the Onows, ably represented by MRe. MueIan, Q.C., who -was soon after raised to the Bench, in indicting several of the prisoners for the murder in the Phcenix Park, others for the attack on Mn. FE,n and tue remainder for conspiracy to murder. Tho trials toolk place in April before MR. Jusreis O'BRIE, who displayed remarkable ability, firmness, and pationce throughout, assisted, it must be said, by juries who did their duty with dignity and courage. BRADY, CuRL-Y, and FoAN were convicted of murder, as was also KELLY, who nearly escaped, however, through repeated disagreements of the jury; CAFxEzBY and DE- LANBY pleaded guilty on the same charge, the latter, who had been serving a term of penal servitude for the attempt on JUDGun Lawsox's life, protesting that he was driven by threats into these criminal courses, and confirming the truth of CAnRY's chief statements. Five of the prisoners suffered the extreme penalty of the law, and they have sinea been treated by the Nationalist party in America and in Ireland as martyrs. The storm of execration which burst upon Canny was dlue quite as much to the semi-political disclosures in his evidence as to the fact that he gave BRADYand his comrades to tho gallowvs. He let in the light on the nature and working of the organizations through which the terrorism of the preceding years had been enforced'; he showed how they were con- nBeted with the Land League through men like ScEmReDAer, who had prompted "the Invincibles" to the murder of Mn. FonsTrE, and who was nevertheless one of the agents recommended to the Government by MR. P-A.NELL at the time of the Kilmainham transaction a! capable of " pacifying" J tha country. Truo bills were found against SHERIDAN and two other persons who had been in close relations with CARnY-WAxeS and Ty?xAx, tho latter being identified with the mysterious figure " No. 1 "-by the Dublin Grand J ury, but there was no chance of obtaining their extradition from the United States. The Government for some time detained CUnEy and the other informers in safe custody, but arrangements were finally made for sending them as privately as possiblo -abroad, which wero unexpectedly obstructed by the reluctance of the Colonies to reneive nr be responsible for them. In Victoria, the Government directly interfered to prevent the landing of a batch of informers. CsiEY vas less fortunate. Sailing for Scuth Africa, iunder an assumed name, hewas Iot at sea between the Cape and NZatal by a fellow-passenger, who turned out to ba an Irish-American named O'DoS;sELL. This murder was hailed with a shout of savage joy in Ireland and tlhe United States, and money vas duly subscribed for O'Do.s.Nxi's defence when he vas placed on his trial at the Old Bailey. In spite of the brilliant and ingenious advocacy of Ma. CHAnixs RussiLL-which has raised the curious question, as yet unsettled in principle, of the right of counsel to lay on behalf of prisoners state- ments of fact of which there is no evidence before the jury-there could be no doubt whatever of O'Do.N? EL's guilt, and his conviction was promptly followed by his execution, The demand for a respite, preferred by the American Government in deference to the Irish vote, was courteously, bat firmly, rejected. The punishment of the Phoenix Park assassins, following that of thb Xaamtrasna, Lough Mask, and Castleisland mur- derers, tended to break up the remaining centren of local terrorism, and in the north, as well as in the south and west, some less important "murder " conspiracies" -wera exposed and hunted down: The result wasthat towards the close of the year li. TREvzLYAN vas able to announcea great diminution! -of outrage. Spasmodic efforts had, however, been made to transfer the oampaign to England.' Ear]y in the spring London was startled by the simultaneous attempts to blow up the, Local Government Board 'buildings and the office of this journal. Other projects of the same sort were detected or suspected elsewvhore. At Birmingham the polico, following up a slendor clue with much patience and skill, dis. covered a secret manufactory of nitro-glycerine and evidence of the proprietor's communications with a number of men, chiefly Irish-Anericans, arrested in London, Glasgow, and elsewhere, with exulo. sives in their possession. Parliament meanwhila had passed the Explosives Bill with exemplary promptitude. On tho trial NoRassN, one of the prisoners, appeared as an informer, and four of the others, convicted of having planned the destruction of several public buildings, of having brought over funds from America for the purpose, and of having explosives in readiness for use, were sentenced to penal servitude for life. A similar conspiracy at Glasgow #vas afterwards brought to light, and the criminals have recently been convicted and punished- at Edinburgh. Alarm sprang up afresh a few months later, when an attempt was made with partial success to produce a destructive explosion at two points on the Metropolitan and District Rail. ways about the same hour. Though a good deal of injury was done to a train near Praed-street, the design was on the whole baffled; the authors havo not been discovered, though no doubt remains that; the means and the motives were the same as in the earlier outrages. After O'DoNNxuL's execution threats of vengeance were again heard, and the authorities have considered them sufficiently seriouas to justify increased precautions for the PaLm ' MIh'sTEa's safety at Hawarden. 1 The formation of the "n National League " in Ireland at the close of 1882 was followed up this year by attempts to extend the new organization- the Land League, under a slight disguiso-through.' out the country. Mleetings were convened fu; 'his -:PurPosmat whichthe suokesmeanof .4th Separatist party denounced the Government, and painted glowing 'pictures of the advan- tages, political and material, to be gained by "Home Rule." The authorities refrained from intdrference unless when there was reason to believe that these appeals to popular passion would lesd to actual erime. In several cases where a re- nawal oE outrages was feared, proclamations under the Crimes Act were issued, and later on, though after some hesitation, the Government decided on adopting the same course in Ulster, where the " iNationalist invasion " had roused the opposition of tha Oranzemen. MAl. HsiAY's election in ISonaghan encouraged his party to hope that Ulster might be won over, bht the proposal to organize the National League in the North provoked, not only in Monaghan, bat in Tyrone and Formanaagh, and in the towns of Derry and Newry, so violent a demon- stration of hostility to the disloyal that at length the meetings on both sides were " pro- "claimed" in order to prevent danger to the public peace. WVhile the tide of Orange feeling was rising high Smt STAFFORD NORTHCOTE Paid a long- promised visit to Belfast. His speeches were in a reserved and tolerant tone, but served ths purpose of eliciting the manifestation of the loyal spirit which pervades the northern pro- vince. The Nationalists have now practically abandoned the hopo of getting a foot- ing in Ulster, and in their disappointment they have charged the Government with partiality towards the Tories and the Orangamen. The accu- sation is an absurd one, for the Oranaemen are not less bitter against LoRD SPErc.Et and his advisers. LoRD RossMonE's removal from the Commission of the Peace, on the ground that he hzd taken an active part in organizing the counter-demonstra- tion at Rosslea, has been denounced by the Orange party, but has not satisfied the Nationalists, who have even refused to give evidence before the Commrissioners sent to inquire into the Derry dis- turbances. aER. PARNELL, who had maintained a perplexing reserve during the greater part of the year, was preparing to reveal his policy. It was thought that he might draw nearer to the Governruent on the common ground of the Fran- chise BiU, but his speech at the Dublin banquet on the 10th inst., when it was announced that a " national tribute " of £88,000 had been collected for him,.showed that he was resolved to continue the struggle for " independence " by the old irre- concilable methods. The " tribute " hal origi- nated nominally as a protest against Ma. FoasrsE's exposure of the Land League and its chief, but it was more energetically promoted as a counter- stroke to the condomnation of the Lesgue in the PoPE's letter to the Irish Bis",English,"/mnt/lustre/rfilguei/TDA_GDA_1785-2009/1883/18831231/0FFO-1883-DEC31.xml"
1883-12-31,"18831231","krakatoa",3,"hops. DR. CRoxE, Archbishop of Cashel, who had met with a re- buke from the Vatican for his activity on behalf of DIB. PARNELL, continued to support the fund, and wherever the National League established its bran^hes the " tribute " throve. The presentation was made the occasion for the delivery of speeches of which the object was ap parentlyto prove that neither the tolerance and the concessions of the British Government, nor- the protests of the Vatican, would be permitted to deflect the party of the League in the smallest degree from the policy of spohation and separa- tion. Tha disruption of the Republican party, which seemed to be imminent when 3I. GAmIIETTA'S death came suddenlv upon France, was avertod by the folly of PRIxCE NAPoLEow. His manifesto, treating the Republic as moribund and demanding a ple'biscite, closed up the Republican ranks. The feeble Cabinets of M1. DIucLEic and M. DE FAL- LIEKES were succeeded by that of 3I. JULES FERRY, who has shown plenty of force of character, and, in spite of many grave errors, has rallied to him a strong and steady majority in the Chambers. Of his policy at home or abroad it is impossible to speak with approval. The Bonapartist movement could scarcely be treated seriously, yet it was made an excuse for the introduction of penal measures dixected not against PRInCE NAPOLEON and his son, but against the OLEA2Ns family. When the Senate refused to assent to this proscription, it was enforced by a Presidential decrae, issued on the advice of Mfinisters, removing the Orleanist princes from tho army. Having paid this tribute to Re- publican prejudice, and at the same time trancuil- lized those who dreaded new political turmoil, M. FERny felt himself strong enough to encounter the Radicals, led by 31. CLEscNEA&u, with a declaration against the revision of the Constitution. In this he was so decidedly supported by public opinion as well as by a Parliamentary majority that he was able to confront firmly the Socialist agitation which attempted to raise its head in the spring. LOUSE lircHzE and other instigators of some dis- quieting " bread riots " in Paris were prosecuted tnd punished, and the commemoration of the Com- mune on the 18th of March was kept sternly within bounds. Internally the Republican position was strengthened further in the autumn by the Co=rrE DE CHAmIIoRD'S death, for though the COS£rE DE PAxis was formally recognized as head of the Royalist party, the activity of the Legitinists was quenched. The FERRY Blinistry unfor- tunately conceived, at an early period, that they were called upon to indemnify the restless spirits of the coantry for enforced quiet at home by a policy of foreign adventure. It was not that Al. FERRy was at all disposed to revive the cry for the Reranche with which bf.GtMnETTA had been popu- larly identified, but rather that he saw further op- portunities for that " Chautinisme with limited " liability " of which the subjugation of Tunis was the outcome. A controversy with the Hova Go- vernment in Madagascar had arisen the year before, and in the spring ADMIRAL. PIEBRE'S squadron was sent out to re-establish " French rights " over the north-west of the island. On the rejection by the Government of QUEEN RANANOLANA cf an ultima- tum insisting on a cession of territory and a large indemnity, the Admiral bombarded and occupied the port o.f Tamatave. The stress of these -ieasures was chiefly felt by the European resi- ,ents, for the most part English merchants or -3Essionaries. The Hovas at once retired into the interior, where the French appear to have been unable for months past to make any further impression upon them. The QUEEN died during these events, but her niece was quiclkly accepted as her successor, and French rumours of dissension and revolution among the Hovas have not hitherto proved to be well-founded. Mluch indigna- tion was excited in this country by the news of ADMIRAL PIERRn's high-handed conduct at Tama- tave, not only towards the Malagasy inhabitants, but towards the British Consul, towards the com- mander of HEa MajTzsr's ship Dryad, and espe- cially towards MBn. StrAw, an English missionary, w.ho was arrested, on charges afterwards abandoned as baseless, and long detained in strict custody, not being even allowed to see his wife, on board a French sbip. For this the French Government mado an apology later on, and offered BIR. SHAwv- who meanwhile had received the honours of a martyr at Exeter Hall-a pecuniary solatium. The British Government could scarcely re- fuse to accept this reparation, particularly as the behaviour of ADMIRAL PIERRE towards the Consul-of which AIR. GLADSTONE had Sp3ken, upon the first reports, in strong language--: turned out to be less objectionable than had been supposed. His treatment of CAPTAL. JOuNSTONTE, of the Dryad, who showed both spirit and dignity in very trying circumstances, was less capablo of defence. But the death of the ADMIRAn, on his ieturn to France in the autumn. and the fact that he had been suffering throughout from a painful and enfeebling disease, justified the abandonment of any personal questions. While France was thus attempting to extend what is miscalled her " colonial empire " in Madagascar, she had begun ano tber task of the same kind, but of still greater difficulty and uncartainty, in the Fiar East. It is probably due to the progress of the dispute with China that operatians in Madagascar have languished of late. The French claims to political and commercial in- fluence over the Kingdom of Annam have been the subject of a complicated diplomatic controversy, but the facts out of wvhich the collision has actually arisen aro simple enough. The Colonial Govern- ment of Cochin-China had grievances of long stand- ing against the Annamese in regardto the obstacles to trade in the northern province of Tonquin, where the " Black Flags," semi-piratical bands, as the French alleged, obstinately resisted a smaU force despatched under CoNErANnDE RivsiB. M. F.EnRxXS Cabinet resolved to prosecute the matter warmly, to insist upon the reduction of Annam to a posi- tion of dependency, and to obtain the mastery in Tonquin; but though the Chamber voted for the Minister's proposals, it is doubtful whether public opinion would have supported an adventurous pohcy-especially as China had already entered a grave protest-if the national pride had not been touched by the repulse of RivikRE's expedition and the death of its brave leader. Reinforce- ments were at once despatched undar ADmiR.&L COURnET, and in July the French were able to re- stme the offensive in Tonquin. After some suc- cesses, they were forced by the flooding of the river banks to retire. Meantime, ADi.IIIAL COURBET advanced on Hu6, the capital of Annam, deposing the King, the nephew of Tu Duc, the old enemy of the French, who had succeeded his uncle a month earlier. The anti-wyar party in Annam, encouraged by this turn of affairs, set up a King who was ready to agree to all the terms exacted by DR. HAwrAND, the French Commissioner, placing the kingdom, including Tonquin, directly under the irotectorate of France. But while these mili- tary operations were going on diplomacy was weaving a tangled web. China had from the outset asserted her suzerainty over the Annamese dominions, and especially Tonquin. Negotiations had been opened with the Chinese Government by M. Bos:ais, M. TRICOu, and M. PATENOTRs, but without result. The scene was then shifted to Europe, where the MARQUIS TszENG defended the interests of his country with a patience and tact which won the admiration of trained diplomatists. Mediation between France and China was spoken of from time to time, but the pretensions of the rival Powers were in fact irreconcilable, and neither would go back. China declared through- out that she would neither recognize the Treaty of Hu6 nor consent to the occupation of Tonquin by France. The French demands were based upon an idea that China would yield when she found herself confronted by an inflexible policy, and M. Fzrpy, in spite of severe and just criticisms on the incon- sistencies and unfairness of his treatment of the CnzESE AesnAssAnoD, carried the Chamber with him on what was nominally a vote of credit, but really one of confidence, early in Decem- ber. The Senate showed itself still more de- cided, and the appeal of the MINISTEr Of WAR to the Army was answered by a vast number of volunteers. In spite of the distinct intimation that Sontay and Bacninh, against which the French troops were advancing, were hald by regular Chinese soldiers, and in spite of a dangarous movement at Hue, where the philo-French King was poisoned and the " National party " regained the ascendency, AnmiDT ConmsBTz pressed on, and after some sharp fighting captured Sontay on the 18th inst. The political and military consequences of this success have not yet been visibly shown. China is still silent; but in France the reaction against gloomy forebodings bas appeared in the form of a popular demand for a pecuniary indemnity, or, in default, the assumption of a " material guarantee."",English,"/mnt/lustre/rfilguei/TDA_GDA_1785-2009/1883/18831231/0FFO-1883-DEC31.xml"

"-C rNnSnE GxORDON ox FIANCE AND CllnIA.- The following expression of opinion by tbe distinguished officer wvho contributed so much 20 years ago to the paciflcation of China, and to the maintenauce of the reign- ing dynasty on the throne of Peain, will be read with interest-at a time when the outbreak of hostilities between France and China must be regarded as oue of tho possibilities oE the immediate future. General Gordon writes as follows:_- Chiina's game is, and wif coutinue to be, to vait upon events; and she will try a'd wotk so as to emlroil us -with France, if she is herself comopelied to go to war with that Power. There are, ard wvould be, plenty of opportunities for tie attsinment of th,s object in tho Treaty Plorts. Gne may say, humanly speakinag, that China going to war wvith Irance must entail olr following suit. Th. wouldcbe a bad thing in mauy 'ways fior civilizaCon, because Sle Chinese aro niaturally bumLptions enough, and any success over Europeans woild raise their arrogance to a perilously high p.teh. And even if their success were due to an alliance with us, our assistance -would be lightly furgotten. Such an alliance would :ot corduce to future harmony. Altogekher, I cannot think- that the wcrld would gain in any respect by a war between France and China- no matter what the result of the contest maglt be; and in the enld I doubt if it v6ould be beneficial to China berself. Of one thing, however, the French may feel sure, and tnat is that the Chinese wxuld avail themselves of all tho mast recent scientific discoveries in the military art, and, in a struggle with a single foreign Power, would corut a good deal on the services of such auxiliaries ns dynamito and infernal machines."

1883-11-24,"18831124","krakatoa",1,"' THE VOLCANIC B£IT'ION 1X JA3 VA. Lloyd's Agents at Batavia, under date of October 16, write H'aving received many communications about this frightful catastrophe, we think it well to giveyoathe report of our resident partner, Mr. 2lacColl, of his recent journey to Mera: and Anjer, which is as follows:- I left Batavia on Monday, the Sth of October, for Serang or Portuguese I Ceram,' the termination' m' being nasal, and much the same as Serang), the capital of the Residency of Bantam. There, as arranged, I -was met by Mr. Schint, floyd's sub-agent for Anjer. We proceeded at onceo for Bantam Bay, seven miles distant, and saw on the way that considerable damage had been done by the volcanic wave, though, of coarse, its force had been greatly spent in passing up the shallows of the Great Bay, and the destruction generally was a mere nothing to what we saw in other places. Even hero, how- evor, 200 people lost their lives, and a good way inlaed me came upon native prows which had been cast in by the waters. Several hundred natives were bere employod in clearing away the fallen trees and in digging a slew canal to let the waters, which bad formci a lagoon, out. Further down the river, at the old town of Bantam ihe damage wvas not so great, and but few lives were lost. It was remark- able to see hero the ruins of the massive old Dutch fortress, const-ucted about 1595, on the principlis of the middle ages, in such good condition, and though the jangle and warirgin trees are gradua.ly closing in upon it,it r:ll be many a year yet before the old walls and eonirasures of 8ft. of substantial masonry give way to this slow but sure outside pressure. Higher up above the embrasures are placed all roand old medi2val turrets, still almost ts per- fect as when occupied by their alert sentinels 300 years ago. These ruins are most picturesque, and in wandering over them the imagsnation is led back to the 10th century, with its stern flghts for the mastery on this very spot betwveen the Portuguese, Dutch, and English forces, all rivals contending for influence over Bantam and its sultans. W'e got down into the bay by a small prow, and could nob but admire the perfect beauty of the anchorage selected by the old European navigators of all nations, after their long voyage round the Cape. Returning to Serang, we left next morning at f for Tjielegon nOw the last Government port on this station. This place wvas still, after sis weeks, completely covered with volcanic ash, plants aad gardens destroyed, and cocoa- nut trees borne dovn by the weight of ash and mud dis- charged by Krakatoa, 40 miles away. Leaving our post carriage we got into k-ahars (nativo spring carts) and went on to Mlerak nas far as the road would take us. I'roteeding a short distance the effects of the volcanic wave vere seen, the road being carried away and great lagoons formed inland. W'e soon had to leave our kahars and proceed on foot, the road being carried away and after this it was a hot scramble of tSwo hours along the beach over fallen trees and rocks before we arfived at what was formerly the important station of BleraL, attached to the Tanjong Priok Harbour Works. The entire district traversed by us, about six miles, was one scene of desolation, which simply cannot Le described or understood unless seen. For miles there was not a tree standing, and wvhere formerly stood namerous kampongs (native villages) surrounded by paddy-filds and cocoa-nut groves, there wvas notbirg but a wilderness, more re- sembling the bottom o. the sea than anything else; rocks of coral stones aud sea-shells strewn every- where. Some of these solid masses of coral lying miles inward could not be less than 100 tons in weight. Arriving at Ioeramk the patti was strewn with pieces oi iron, while her aind there wvere portions of thia [edding and furniture of the houses of the Europeans, and every- wvheio shreds of native cloth ng, women's anid n 'eu's badjus and sarongs. W e vvere informed offcially that the number of bodies baried in the district ne came througlh was 2,700. Arriving at wlhat was oiiee the centre of the Govern- ment quarry works for the Batlavia flarbour works, we climbed the small hil1, whlere the houses of tbe principal enginecrs anid officials fornmerly stood. Of these ibere is literally not one stone left, and louking at the scene of dIsolation around, it was diflicalt to conceive that it ha ornce been a busy place, enmployinig over 1,000 people, in- clidinjg families. Strewnt about were m:assive iron trollies, engines, locomotives. fragsii nts of iron columns, and rails torn up and twisted like wire. Nodh ng remaiDs of the large workshop erected on solid cem!eiit foundations sup- porting iron pillars, of the extensive stores, nor of the wharf at which the hopper barg-s wvere loadt d. The volcanic wave must, in my op;nion, have been even hiaher than the general estimate of 10ft., and I base my opinion on the fact that the oftEcial height of the small lill of bIeranh is 35 metres (115ft.),wbilu the wave wlhich sv-e-pt away the houses must, of course, have been still hihber than the GOp of the hill, and this additionial height I estimate to be 20;t. This fact 1 ascertained pretty accurately liy a careful estimate of the height from the gruund of wrecokage attached to tbo stems of a couple of cocoanut trees still standing. This would give here, at all events, a to-al height of 13ft., and I confirmed this by further observationi at another place which we passed on our -way tack, a few miles further dowvn the coast. Of course, where the wave entered a valley advancing gradually to the foot of the mocntanins some miles inland a more scientific way of mea- surement would have to be adopted, bt;t here I Avas virtnally on the sea, and could pretty accurately estimato the height in many places by the marks on the rocks, with the offlcial hoight of Mlerak as a basis. On the top of this hill the whole community of worl-nken tcok refuge when the first wave came at C a.m., and fancying themselves safe there they returned again, when the second and much higher wave of 9 a.m. came and swept them all nway. On the foundation Uf one of the houses on the hilltop, tr. Bursley, an American, formerly at Anjer, has erected a bamboo house with flagstaff attaohed, and, until something definite is settled about a new port of call he has permis- sion to make this a hilot station. Mlerak certainly did not striko ne as being a suitablo place for a port of call. There is a strong current, and if vessels anheored inthelee of the outer island it would not be easy to work them out again. Water isscarce,and there is no soil suitable in the immediate reighbourhood for growing vegetables, fruits, &c. In fact, there is no country or popu- lation behiud it, as was tho caso wvith Anjer. However, the Netherlands India Government are studying the ques- tion of a neov port of call for outward bound vessels throuigh the Sunda Straits, bound for Java, Singapore, Penang, Chinia, and Japani, and we may be sure that whon a final selection Is niada it will only havo Leon decided upon after due observation and consideration. Our next point was to get back to our inhars, and to make for Anjer. We sooni again came on the traces of de- struction, the sea here having entered along valley just below Tjflegon as far as six mi!es inland, forming a great lagoon. lroreeding further on the road from Tjilegon to Anjer, we camne to the old post-station of Tjiad.eng, not one stone of it remaining-biuilding, men, and horses having been carried away. l'nshing on, we found the road had been very woell repuaird till within three miles of Anjer, and altogether the energy displayed everywhere by the Government is beyond all praise. Hundreds of peoplo were at work in all directions, remaking roads, clearing away trees, burninig rubbish, and strewing the ashes on the sea-swept soil in the hope of fstute improvement. Every- where, in fact, there wvas activity and energy, and where our road ended and we had to wvalk there were rows of rice carts, and t he grain vas being given out by native officials to tho various head men for distribution in their viUlages. The appearance of tho country was even more wretched than before, and from the bill on tho Anjer shore looking north-east to )lerak, 11 miles distant, and inland to the foot of the liUls four to fivo miles, this -wedge-like plain of an area of about 40 square miles is one vast scene of deso- lation, being completely swvept from end to end, andinot one house or tree to be seen, and what this means in a tropical country, where usually every plot of lit ground is occupied, can be readily understood. Mlany thousands wero lost here, and there aro graves in every direction, but deep onough to cause little or no effluviutn. Getting round this bill we came at onceo into the vaUey of Anjer, a semi-circlo of four miles from point to point, and extending two miles inland, wvith a fine range of hills closing all in. In the centre of this plateau and fronting th3 sea vas originally situated the towvn of Anjor, but from where we stood on first turning the corner of the path there was nothing to be seen but lagoons, with here ani there great boulders cast about, and not a vestige of a house. We proceeded, however, and at lengtli came upon the site of the town and fort. Of the fort thero is almost nothimg left, great blocks of masonry being cast inland. Of the town- still less remains, for not one stone is to be seen above another. mlr. Schint, who lost seven of his re- lations, went to look for his house, but could not fhnd a trace of it, and after a time he concluded that tho river, which formerly formed tho crook, had changed its courso, and was dwowing over the spot where his house and that of the Assistant-Resident once stood. There was not even a ruin, everything having been razed to the ground, and it was difficult to realize that the town of Anjer bad ever existed. Olothing and bedding were scattered about hero and thero, but otherwise there was, beyond the graves, nothing to Ehow that a town and a snore of i mpDngs had ever stood there. I met here a most intelligent native official distributing rice to the people. He went with me to what w.as the Euro- pean cemetery, on rising ground half a mile to tho south of Anjer. There a number of peoplo had takcen refugo after tho first wave, but thoy were carriel off by the s6cond wave. Manyaof thegravesvwere completelysncoeel out, and, what with the ash-rain and the effects of the voleaulic wave, there was not s trace of tne place ever having been a cemetery. One of the prominent landmarks of A.njer wasa high monument to a British officer of Sir Stamford Raioe's time, Colonel or General Oathbart, but there is not a trace of it left. Tie grave, however, is intact, as tho solid masonry over it hag not been carried zaway. Near here passed the conduit conveying the drink- ing 7vater to Anjer, but it is entirely destroyed, and about a mile further up the water is sen doewing into the folds. The water is there. l:owever, and it wvould not cost much to rebuild the conduit down to the old creek, and it appeared to me that there wvere more advantages here than at 31oral, for thero is drinking water, and within a radius of two to tlhree miles there is a district capable of learing vegetables and fruits. Atprosenttho entire countryoutsido the volcanic wave is covered with ash throwing olf n strong glare, but in timo it may be found to be a fertiliser of tho soil. Fronn Anjer we could see looming up in tho distance the oldl volcanic peak of hmkatan, thOUgh tbe rest of the islanud, with the new and terrible crater, had disappeared. The seak of r'ule Sibessio wvas also distinctly visible, hot not tOnew lowv-lying islands recently throwvn up betwveen it and lKrakatan. " Dlwars-in-dew Wilg," or " Thwvart thb Way," was very distinct, and has certainly all the aupearance of hole broken up into seven islets, but thls We kDow from tho Government survey is not the case, 4WXijonepart htvitng s4l, tbrowinr oet into * separat islet the southern end of the island, the channei betweer the twvo beinlg about one mile in widih Weo spent three bonrs vralkting over this district, re- turning to our rlahars at ii p.m., having been on foot since o a.m. WVe got to Tjilegon at 6, puashiag on at once to Serangi, vrhere vwe got post-orses, and proceeded direct to Of course I saw but a small portion of the districts destroyed by the volcanic wave, but -what I saw will serve as a sample of the rest of the populated part of the coast as far as Tjeringin, 30 miies south of Anier. The real cause of these volcntic waves remains very o1scure,aud,as The Times of the 29th of August says, seismology is still in its infancy. It was at frat thought that there was but one wave; but we now know that the vil- lage of Sirib, six miles below Anjer, was partially su b- merged at 1 o'clock- on Sunday night, the 26th of August. This I had from the headmau himself, who at the time re- ported it at once to the Assistent Resident of Anjer, aind I ave had this confirmed. At Anjer, however, nothing vwas felt and no alarm was experienced, but at 9 next morning the whole place was gone. It would appear fr.sm this.how- ever, that these wvaves are at times partatl in their effects. The catastrophe has been serious enough witbout add- ing to its horrors, as was done ;; the sensational telegram from llewv York, the bulk of wveich is such a palpable tissue of untruths that it would be a waste of time to con- tradtct them in detail. Tlio report tceegraphed from Neiv YCork that one-third of the volcanoes in Java ha 1 become active was incorrect, for none of thenm were affected by the iiricaLtoa eruption; neither has the liradang range nor any part of the actual coast line of Java disappeaied, though a great area was for a timo submerged. Ut the 25,OuO ( hinese in Batavia, oEf whom the telegram says " It is hardly probable that more ti an 5,cO0 managed to save their lives," no. one life-4 hinese, native, or Europeani- has l een lost in Batavia. The statement that of Lhe 3,500 Europeans and Americans in Batavia 800 perished at Anjer, is also untrue. lho total population of Anjer waa proLably not more than 50. It was said that the dome of the temple of i,orobodo was crusled in by falling rocks, iut the Borobodo is fully 300 miles d;stant from Krakatoa, and has not been affected in any way. It is to i tre- gretted that such reports were circulated, as they greatly increased the general anxiety felt for us in i_urope by frifnds and relations. The Dutch Xetherlands 'adian civil and miltaryservices are recruited from every province in Iolland, and you can imagine the alarm and di.may caused by such reports. lYo have still to add that Mr. Sehint retains the sub- agency for Sunda Straits, and he has just telegraphed that he is about to erect a temporary station at Merak. The nearest telegraph station ua present is Tjilegon. We en- close for your information a map of the residency of Bantam. The total number of lives 'lost iiaBantamand on the opposite coast of Sumatra is estimated at not less than 40,000 and not more than 50.000. The total funds received to date by the Batavia Relief Committee are slightly in excess of 272,000, ouit of -which 215,000 has been paid.",English,"/mnt/lustre/rfilguei/TDA_GDA_1785-2009/1883/18831124/0FFO-1883-NOV24.xml"

His object in collecting the matter brought down by the snow was to determine the nature of the small particles fdoating in the ,-r which have caused the extraordinary sunset phenomena that have receutly been observed over a wide area. On examining the sediment chemically he found it contained parge quantities of black oxide of iron, which could be aeparated readily by the magnet from the rest of the material brought down. Some of his experiments led him 'to infer the presence of nickel in the iron, wbich is characteristic ot meteoric iron, pure iroa or iron alloyed -with nickel never being found native upon the earth. Though Mr. Willinmrsa experiments were decisive as to the ,presence of large quantities of black oxide of iron, he could not speak with equal certainty at present us to the presence of the nickel. He thought it quite impossible that such heavy particles shouli have remained in the air since the eruption of Krakatoa. MIr. Ianyard said he had examined some of the snowv residue collected by Mr. WYilliams, and found it satisfactorily free from terrestrial dust, as there was no indication of carbonate of lime on adding ihydrochioricacid, which would cause it to effervesce if there bad been any dust picked up fromthe weald of liarro, across which the wind bad blown. It was possible that the large black particles might be volcanic, but, if so, it was difficult to conceive how they should have re- man ed, considering their size, in the air so long, and could have been carried round the world from Java to the WVest Iudies in seven days. The Astronomer Royal asked ,whether there was any evidence that the particles of iron .cers themselves magnetic, and were not merely particles of iron that might have been derived from'blast furnaces. 'Mr. Mtal:ien Williams thonght it was quite impossible that the amount which he had shown to exist could be derived frum such a source. There were evidently small particles of iron in addition to the larger particles of black oxiee. :le wished to remark that in the sunsets he had observed there wore distinctly two glows. tho first evidently similar to the ordinary sunsets, in which the colour vwas reflected from the under surfaces of the cloud. That faded away and there was then abrightening up again of the colours, and the cloud3 could be seen as dark objects projected on a brilliant roay background, showing that the matter which caused the second glow was suspended at a great height in the *tmosphere, probably far above the region in which clouds are formed. : LomDON TO TEE RIvrEr.

Then the canal gradually died, and all was as before ; the only thing left by which you could soe that anything had happened was that the whole towa was covered with pumice ashes quite tbick, making things look as if it had' been snoving. People, of course, in a grca fright. The awful news did not reach unti2, I think, Wednesday, when a pilot came in whose wife had been washed UD into a treo and left by the wave. Be brought the intelligence that Krakatoa had disappeared and the channel blocked. Ioere was news for me to get ! Fortunately, a Netherlando India steamer was erpected from the Straits, and wo only bal to wait. She did not arrive until Saturday after, noon. The commander's report was something awful. The big channel remained clear, lie believed,; as lie came thron,h it, but it was strewn with hugw trees, bodies, andi hields of i30ating pumice. Plcasant,j was it not, for us? Oar agents suggested going. by Singapore, but I argTed that if one ship could get tbrough I could. We were ready forsea on Saturday. evening, but I did not leave till 2 on Sunday morniug, so ag; to have good dayliglt all through the Straits. The taovcrn-! ment had placea a mao-of-war at eache nd of the Straits' to warn ships, becauso all tho lig>ts were down ; so ]. tooki our pilot out and put lins on board the ship cruising on tlioe western edge, with a letter from the zldiirail telling tllom to intercept the Rloma, wwhich was dae from Adun in a. coupte of days, and put hinm on boardl. adl glad I was to hear it vas done.

At last we saw Krakatoa. only the principal peak left, the whole north part cut dawn perpenidicularly, and gone clean away. It was still smoling iitlplaces vhere it bad not been smoking previcusly,so I am mnuch afraid there will be more mischief. It was a lovely day,and I was hibl to get a series of anugles, from which I have nmade a chart, which I am l10.ving at Aden for the out-going steamers. After, passing Krakatoa thiiigs got thicker in tho water, huga trees, roots and all, like islands, every conceivablo thing that thatawful wave could tear away. I got awfullyanmions' about this time. I could not find the man-of-var, and, night coming on, the thought of having to cruise all night in such company gave nle the cold shivers.

Daylight came in with mw dell!,blov.y day and torrents of rain, but anything was, pleatsant after those aw ful Straits. I am curious to hear rtiter reports at Aden, liecause that morning, at 11, whoa qluite 140 miles away, we heard a most tremuendoas report like a heavy peah of thunder, right in the direction of the, Straits. If tha rest of the island is gene, Beavain save th ei shins we loft there 1" L1oyd's ngents at Batavia, under date of September I1 write as follows:- o The past week is memorable as having witnessed one of the most disastrous ncd seovero volcanic eruptions cver known in the Malay Aichipilago. Krakatca has again been the origin of the disturbance. On Sunday last, about 4 p.m,, a serics of det: nations vere heard proceedin apparently from the so-uth-wvest. Towvards night these grov louder, till in the early mrcrning the reports and cencus. eions wero simnply deafenin g, nat to say alarming. When day broke the atmosphere te the west bad a suiphurous and lurid appearance, and a thin ltyer tfoline whie asl coverei the ground. Towardls 9 a.m. the reports died away, bhut abouit an hounr terdiarkelouide quite obscured the sky and thb sun. A hcavv raiu (f ashes, sulh)ur, and dust commenced to fall, and at 11 na.. this town was in pitch darkness and business totally suspen:ild. About 12 o'clock (midday) a large wave, about 1i.ft. in hoight, swept in from the sea, causing many prow-s and small craft to te driven ashore, but doing but little damage to tbo shipping in harbour. This being the dry mc.nsion, the rivers aLre low at present. The wave, however, drove an immense volume of water up our rivers, vhich saddenl- rose s) high that the banks at the river mouth were flooded and mnany small cmfts stranded. Happily the wave subsided again suddenly, leaving the rivers almost dry, and about . o'clock the rain of asbes sabsided and the atmozphere grew lighter. Shortly after 2 p.m., however, another wave, larger than the frst, came rolliing in from the sea. A. few native fishermen -were drowned by this wave, and twvo Europeans at Onrast also lost their lives. At Tandjong Priok the Princess 'Wilhelmina was Nithin an ace of strauding, while some small crafts and prows were case high up on land. \o further damaoe, hvowever, occurred in Batavia. The eruption, bowvever, so far es 'we can learn, hashad most fatal and disastrous eifects all along-ohb soith-wvest coast of Java, and also on the south coast of Sumatra. We shall not probably be in posseOssion of full particulars for some days yet, as telegraph lines are damaged and reads destroyed, but so far owe can give the followving particulars. The island of E akatoa, the snmmit of which peak w as 2,G00ft. above wvater level, haa totally disappeared belov. the sea, and the neighbouring islanld of Dvwnisindeyweg is split in five parts. Sixteen non volcanic islands have been formed batween Krakatoa end Sibesie, and the sea bottam in the Straits of Sunda hat completely changed. In fact, the Admiral Commanding. in-Chlief has issued a circular stating that till new soundings have been taken the navigation of the Straits of Snuda is likely to be extremely dnagerous. Anjer and lighthouse and the other lights of south-west Java lave all been destroyed. The subsidencies and up- heavals wve have alluded to caused a large -wave about IOOft. in height to sweep down on the south-west coast of Java and south of Snmatra. This wave swept inland for a great distance, thereby doiig great injury both to life and property. Weo are here only 12 miles away from one of tlo points on which the wave spent its fury. The whole coast- line to the south- west has changed its configuration. Tho inhabitants of the island Onrust were only saved from the flood which swept over the island by taking refuge on board two steamers. At Merak Government establishment tho inhabitants took refuge on the knol3, 6oft. high, but were all swvept off and drowned, with the exception of one European and two Malays, who were saved. 14auk and Bramat, west side of Batavia Roads, have beon laid waste and about 300 lives lost. In Tjorengin only ono house has been left standing. Both the native end European of bcials have perished. A rain of mud also fell at the above place, which is situatei opposite to where Krakatoa island once lay. Asijer seems to have been completely destroyed. Lloyd's sub-agent there wires from Serang :-' AU gonC. Plenty lives lost.' The dry dock at Amsterdam Island was carried away by the waves,but has since been found stranled in Iiddelbsrg Island. The Pedang steamer, which left here on Sunday, returned next day to Anijer, only to lind the place in rains. Thecaptain reports that his vessel was in great danger, owing to th ceruption from 3Krakatoa. On his arrival at Selok Betong, his hrst part of ca5l, the placs was found completely destroyed. We understand that it has been submerged, but are not yet in possession of full garticulars. WVe hear that on lUonday the wvholo of West 3ava, as far as Banding, was shrouded in darkness and "overed by ash rains. A telegram just in informs us that the explosions from Krakatoa were hoardatDoli (Sumatra), whilchplace is opposite Penang. The Government bere, 'we understand, in the interest of shipping, are sending out steamoers to cruise at either end of tho Straits of Sunda, to warn vessels to observe catution while passing the Straits, as charts are no longer reliable. According to latest telegram from Serang we learn that in the recedenco of Tieringin alono I0,00I) lives wore ealculated to be lest.

1883-12-11,"18831211","krakatoa",1,"TITB B?ChilrT CLBSETIIAL TH.PHNOMENA. TO THE EDITOR OF TEll TIUES. Sir,-Tbe date of the great eruption of Erakatoa, as compared with the date of the earliest observations of the blue sun and abnormal sunset phenomena, would seem at first sight to favour the hypothesis that the colours are due to light dispersed by volcanic dust borne away by the trade winds; but a closer examination of the facts render such a connexion improbable. These who have watched an eruption of Etna or Vesuvius Inow how the volcanic vapours are carried to a certain alti- tude above the crater, where they spread out in a horizon- tal loud, which, under ordinary circumstances, does not attain a very great altitude. It is possible to conceive tlat such a cloud laden with dust might, in the neighbour- hbcd of the equator, be carriezl upward by the heated air which gives rise to the trade winds. But in the northern hemisphere tle traile winds blow in a north-easterly direc- tion, and this theory vill not account for the carriageof dust to India, which lies to the north-west of Java; or to South Africa, which lies in a south-westerly direction. The fine dust of the Sabara,carried upwards by exceptionally strong winds, occasionally reaches Rome and Florence, but all traces of it are lost as far north as Paris and London. It seems therefore improbable that terrestrial dust should be carried upwards by the wind and distributed over a whole hemisphere. It has been suggesced that dust nas on this occasion projected by the volcanic forces to a far greater altitude than the altitude reached by the dust from the Sahara. But dust projected with great velocity would be rapidly stopped by the resistauce of the atmos- pbere, and vould not, unless borne away by the vind, be carried as rar as stones and large masses of scerire. 'the volcanic theory is, however, oenmietely negatived by the oLservation of tho blue sun settin gin the fiery havens as scon from Trinid'adl (near to the centre of the opposite hemisphere from the Krakatoa eruption) on the ld of September, for it caunot be supposed that the volcanic matter wvas carriel half round the earth in the period of seven days which elapsed between the aftcrnoon ofSunday, the 2Cth of August, when the Java eruption began, and Sunday the 2d of Sepntember. vwhen the blue StUI waVs seen setting at Trinidad. Acceeding to the letter of Mr- IV. B= 1Griliti publishedl in Tho TimeLs of December 5. the sun was secn from Cape Coast Castle, mere than 6,000 miles from Java, to rise blue on the mornings of the 1st and 2d of September. Such observationssimultaneouslyiiuede at distantparts of the vorld render it more probable that the earth en- countered a cloud of dust in space jest before the lst of September. In a paper publislhed in the IoethkbI Notices of the Rayal Asteonomical Society for January 1879, I have collected a series of observations which show that meteoric dost is continually entering the earth's atmosphere and is ultimately deposited on the earth's surface. If the dust. laden region wvas so large that tlhe earth occupied many hours in passing through it, wve may expect to And that the phenomena caused by the piesence of dust in the higher atmosphere wore in the tiret instance observed over more than a hemisphere. The blue and green appearance of the sun while rising and settin seems enlyto have been noticed in the clear air of the tropics. I amn. Sir, your obedient servant.- A.

1883-12-11,"18831211","krakatoa",1,"To THE EDITOR OF THE TES. Sir,-In connexion with IlII. lNorman Lockyer's striking communication to TA'h Times of to-day, the following facts seem to be of considerable interest. On the 18th of August, 1821, the phenomenon of a " blue sun " was witnessed in many parts of Egland. hIr. B. hI. Forster, a well k-nown meteorologist, observed it at Shore- ditch between 9 and 10 an.m., and described the colour of the disc, across which thin clouds were rapidly flitting, as " azure or sky blue." " Independently of this blue colour," he adds, " the sun that morning attractad the notice of reople by its unusual appearance; it has been described as looking like quicksilver oinat like varnished silk, and was mistaken for an air balloon." (Philosophical agaDa:tie," vol. LVIII., p. 234). In 'r, A. towrvd's AVckgroAicaZ Jk.reL fM August, 1821, the following entry occurs on the 18th 1 " The sky this morning was obscured by a haze, through wbich the sun appeared of a pale blue colour, resembling, in some degree, tie fnae of sulphur or of a Benal light.1 The phenomenon was u'jserved in several distant places. I have been informed that it was noticed in Es3ex and Worcestershire, and by many persons about London. I saw it in Sussex, .here it lasted from about 9 till near noon, and appeared nearly of the colour of watch-spring steel." C" Annals of Philosophy," vol. II., p. 320). A note bearing the signatures of Humboldt and Arao, entered in the Mleteorological Register of the Paris Observa- tory under the same date, records that although the light of the sun towards 6 p.m. was so enfeebled by dense vapours as no longer to dazzle the eye, yet it continued absolutely white. (" Annales de Chimle et do Physique," t. XVM., p. 420.) Mloreover, on August 24, the inhabitants of Letterkenny, in Ireland, were dismayed by a portentetne darkness lasting from noon until 2 p.m., during which fowls ;veat to roost axd candles had to belit forthe transaecion of business. (P1kifesophtca Maggezine, vol. LVIII., p. 314.) Looking to the records of volcanic eruptions during the months preceding these unusual appearances, we fnd that a violent eruption took place in the island of Bourbon, February 27, 1821, which lasted far into April. and during which a quantity of ashes was emuitted. Still more tremen- dous was the outbreak of the "burning islacd " of Gunung-Api, situated some 1,500 miles due east of Krakatoa, Juine 11 and 12, 1820. In all its features, except the most destructive one of the sea wave, it appears to have borne a striking resemblance to the catastrophe of August 26 and 27, 1883. Whether tha interval of 14 months is sufficiently long to exonerate it from all suspicion of concern with the " blue sun " of Angust 18, 1S21, future experience fill perhaps decide. I am. Sir. vours faithfully. T. -M. CLERIE. London, Dec. 8.",English,"/mnt/lustre/rfilguei/TDA_GDA_1785-2009/1883/18831211/0FFO-1883-DEC11.xml"
