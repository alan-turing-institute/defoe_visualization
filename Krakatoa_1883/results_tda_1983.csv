Anak Krakatoa In action: Survival Special ITV/London at 7.30pm a By rights, Anglia Television should have called It Son of Krakatoa, because their Survival Special, KRAKATOATHE DAY mTAT SHOOK THE WORLD (ITV, 7.30pm) Is not about that cataclysmic day back In August 1883 at all, but about what has been happenIngt in the 36,00Q odd days since then. A new volcano has heased itself out of the sunken entrails of its horrible father who killed 36,000 people as it blew up and sank, somewhere east of Java. And now the lusty infant, all 1 OM0t of him, ltt smokino and rumbling away just like hlsOad, and managing the occasional tremor just to warn off anyone foolish enough to set foot oh him. Nothing dawnted, the t3erman. born camneraman Ditetr Plage has thumbed his nose atthe boIsterous peak and tonight's remarkable documentary Is the result. Not that Anak Krakatoa Is much to writs home about. It looks, in fact, as welcoming and feorie as the surface of the Moon; It Is certainly just as deserted. The real mirace of Mr Plago's film is not, then, the son of Krakatoa but the incredible richness of the flora and fauna that has retumed to the mainland at UJong Kulon, 25 miles or so away, an area Inundated by the SOft hgh tidal wave that Krakatoa pushed out as it sank Into Its graye. This Is Nature's return with a vengeancebouncing mudskippers, crocodiles, fiddler crabs, box terrapins, giorgeous blossoms, and tte near- extinct Java Rhino that looks as prehistoric as the King Kong-type vegetation into which intrepid cameramen like Mr Piage venture in the hope of getting the monster In their viewfinder. Mr Page ithe first man to capture the beaston *colour timn. * By happy coincidence, RadIo 3 carries a converation pieco tonight about geological instablity compared with which Krakatoa Der& et fift are minor aberrations. MOVING MOUNTAINS (Radio 3, 9.40pm) is about restless continents that roam airound the face of the earth whereas all that Krakatoa Snr. did was to crumble Into the sea. The language in Moving Mountains Is much more technIclt, as you would expect, but mnore often than not you should find yourself on terra firma rather than all at sea as Dr Dan McKenzie of Cambridge University explains why the expression ""rock-solld"" cart be a contradiction In tirms. 6.05 Open UniNrsily Maths; 0.30 Shooting the Moon; 6.55 Looking at Heat; 7.20 Quantum Theory; 7.45 Evolution. 10.30 Play School: Joyce Rushby's story The 9leepy Giant (also on BBO1, at 4.30); 10.i6 Closedown. 4.20 Intemattonal ""f: Second round of the Benson and Hedges International Open, from Fultord Golf Club, York. 5.10 Shooting Scene 341: Filming stunt and battle scenes for the Bond movie, The Spy Who Loved Me (r); 5.36 Weekend Outlook: Open Univerasty trailers, including Charlotte Bronte. 5.40 Chaffli Chaplin: On.

06/08/1983,19830806,krakatoa,1,"A canoe for two and a dog Icalled Wu Sat.uuIay 6-12 AUGUST 1983 A WEEKLY GUIDE TO LEISURE, ENTERTAINMENTANDTHEARTS From blue caps to crash hats . . . canoeing has developed from a Victorian gentleman's pastime into an ever more popular sport. Simon Barnes takes up the paddle True. the Eskimocs and the Rcd Indians had something to do with it, but it took a Victorian gentlcman to bring canoeing to the rcst of the world. His heirs are an ill-assorted bunch: jolly familics with egg-and-cress sandwiches double-wrapped in polythenc; terrifying fitness freaks, whose sole aim in life is to complete the gut-churning race from Devizes to Wes- tminster in less than 16 hours; gentle-mannered, bearded nut- cases whose idea of a quict holiday is to canoe down a mountain, Everest being the sort of mountain they have in mind: slalom specialists whose game is ducking between poles suspended over sudsy, turbulent water: sprint racers, simple souls who simply like to leave wakes of fire and win Olympic medals; and old buffers who can paddle up and down rivers a sight quicker than they can walk. John MacGregor was the first canoeing gentleman, a Victorian cccentric in the established tradition, who paddled the length of rivers such as the Nile and the Jordan, and wore a jacket and tie to do it in. He designed a canoe, called it the Rob Roy, and sploshed his way about the world, writing books such as 1,000 miles in the Rob Rov and Rob Roy on the Baltic. He lounded the world's first canoc club in 1866, which was latcr allowed to call itself the Royal Canoe Club, and still operates enthusiastically from its base on Trowlock Island near Hampton Wick, in Middle- sex. There is a splendid club- house to remind you of Kenneth Grahame and muck- ing about in boats, with pictures of great days on the wall, including one of Edward VII, when he was Prince of Walcs and commodore of the club. ""It was a gentleman's sport"", confirmed the present commo- dore, Brian Haynes, who canoed for Britain in the 1976 Olympic Games in Montreal. ""White flannels and blue caps."" On a Saturday afternoon now, it is, all swimming togs and cold lager from the bar, yet the Royal Canoe Club still produces most of Britain's best sprint canoeists ""It's a centre of excellence"", said Haynes. There are many other centres Of excellence in canoeing, because canoeing is a sport with many faces. Down at Hayling Island you find the sailing canoe people: ""People are very serious about the sport in Britain, West Germany and Sweden"", said Haynes. ""To tell the truth, we intend to giggle about it but, in fact, a sailing canoe is the fastest mono-hulled sailing boat around."" Eat your heart out, Peter de Savary: it doesn't cost £5m eitherthe reported cost of de Savary's attempt to win the America's Cup for Britain. ""That is one of the charms of canoeing"", said Haynes, ""Swim- ming apart, it is the cheapest way to get on to the water and cnjoy it."" A second-hand canoe can be picked up for about £50, And a top-class raccr is only £400. Canoeing boasts, and with justice, that it is a sport as suitable for children of six as adults in their seventies, and the road to the Olympic Games beckons every embryonic sprint racer. There is the further charm of proximity to the water. In one of these skimpy little shells, weighing only a few pounds, it is impossible to be closer to the water without actually getting wet: the boat responds to evcry ripple and every twitch, which means the tiro finds it appal-- lingly difficult to move it in a straight line. The knack of so doing, once acquired, however, cnables even those with the most modest ambitions to idle along at a fair lick. ""How else could an old fellow like me travel miles up and down rivers under my own steam?"" asked the Royal Canoe Club's har- bourmaster, Len Leach, a venerable gentleman with a floppy hat and a curious obsession with volcanoes. There is a curious mixture of people at the Royal. ""Racers aren't really club people"", said the commodore. ""We tend to be egotistical maniacs. For many people, a club is just somewhere to keep your canoe, an access point to the water. On the other hand, a lot of members aren't interested in racing, they just like to take their canoes out and cruise around. Outsiders think we spend all our time in crash- hats doing Eskimo rolls and capsize drill. Most of us never even get wet."" But down on the great foaming rapids of the turbulent Thames, getting wet from head to foot is de rigueur, as canoeists do battle with the seething waters two miles from Henley. The place was Hamble- den Weir, one step in the giant staircase of locks along the Thames, where the sluices spit out vast volumes of foam with that particular aroma that only the Thames possesses. The Hambleden Weir Association, a group of locally based clubs, love their little vat of turbu- lence, spend hours riding the rough and tumbling water, and set up slalom competition. ""It's a question of making the water do the work"", said Paul Taylor, a member of Chalfont Park Canoe Club, another centre of excellence, though a less resplendent one than the Royal. Club premises are a shed erected, apparently rather hur- riedly, by members, and a few piles of canoes, some with felt- penned ""For Sale"" signs. In the water, grim-faced novice com- petitors were floundering away, some ducking the challenge of the turn into the foaming mass of water by the sluice gate and getting shoved miles off their line as chastisement for such faint-heartedness, while others were spat out of the weir like cherry pips after paying the ultimate price for error. Among the competition offi- cials was Roger Fox, father of Richard Fox, the world slalom British speciality; Britain has won tho Europa Cup for marathon racing each year since the competition started in 1980. Canoeing naturally has its school of cruel sea enthusiasts, including canoe surfers, who enjoy being thrown around by waves in boats that can be remarkably difficult to leave. ""'The surf community tend to go their own way"", said Havnes. Others find fulfilment in the unusual sport of canoe polo, wliich you play in a swimming pool. One of the leading teams. Luton Tigers, recently had their come-uppance when they went down to Bere Forest in a viciously competitive national final. By the end of the day, the jolly families, their sandwiches long since consumed, have tossed thcir canoe on to the roof-rack and driven honmc- ward. The fitness freaks are discussing training schedules over strength-giving formula drinks, while the non-racers at the Royal Canoe Club have one more cold lager for the road. The sea people are wondering if the surf will be up the next day, while the nutcases are wondering if it is possible to canoe down Kilimanjaro and Richard Fox is wondering about his chances of retaining his world championship in 1985. Robert McLaughlin is pulling his canoe on to a beach in the nortlh of Scotland, while har- bourmaster Leach is paddling gently back to base, his head full of dreams of Krakatoa. It is another day in which the canoes of Britain have been duly messed about in. Tomny Hkodley Wild water cainoeing in Wales: ""Outsiders think we spend all our time doing Eskimo rolls and capsize drill. Most of us never ever get wet"". champion. This is a sport at wlhich the British cxcel. ""I introduced Richard to canoeing because I love touring"", he said. ""I'm mostly interested in the recreational side, on white water, that is. Along the upper Wye. the Usk, Scottish rivers. Richard took to it like a duck to water."" He won the world championship in 1981 at Bala, in Wales, and retained it this year in Merano, in Italy. Training needs organization and trips to find suitable water, although Liz Sharman, women's world slalom cham- pion, does most of her training on a duck pond. ""Wild-water racing is what I like best"", said John Bunyan, an incongruously named Chalfont Park man. A suggestion that this sport, the wet equivalent of downhill skiing, an all-out burn against the clock over up to five miles of angry river, was 'less prccise than slalom racing, wa not well reccivcd. ""it is more precise. You must read the water. And if you make a mistake it will cost you."" John Gosling knows that better than most. He has canoed down Everest, and was on the cxpedition to K2 on which the leader, Mike Jones, died. Gosling, who was the man behiind the eccentric course contested in the recent (BBC) television programme Paddles LIp. spent five months on the terrifying trip along the glacier- fed waters of Everest. It was, hie said unsurprisingly, ""pretty hairy"". He added: ""There is at the end a sense of satisfaction. The knowledge that you have set out to do something and succeeded."" Canoeing tends to attract people with wild desires to takc on the great forccs of the world. Take Robert McLaughlin, who is in the middle of circumnavi- gating Britain by canoe. He started out from the Royal C(anoe Club, paddled to South end and turned right. He has sleeping bag and food bundled into watertight compartments of his boat, he paddles all day and pulls up on to a beach at night. He will not be thei first person to achieve this feat; that was a woman who set off in 1933, and she took her'doganother great British eccentric, except that she was a German calied Fridel Meyer. She did not complete the trip until 1934, being held up by various excitements on the way, including being ar- rested as a suspected spy and saving a man from drowning by supporting him across her bows for two hours. Naturally, she later married him. Thc dog, a chow, was called Wu Pei Fu. The ambition of the Royal's Haynes is to set a new record for crossing the channel by canoe. He reckons that on the right day he has a grand chance of beating the existing record (3hr 33min 47sec) and is aiming to give it a whirl next summer. Others find the charm of marathon racing irresistible. Marathon is a misnomer here; races can be as short as three or four miles, or as long as the Devizes to Westminster self- torture, which involves 76 portages around the locks. ""It has a cult following, like thc London Marathon. I don't fancy it myself', said Haynes. But marathon racing is another Oavid Train bndkig pupils st his school in FI&Ibury, Phoograph: Colin Curwood Weirs, wellington boots and other watery hazards THE BRITISH CANOE UNION The BCU is the governing body of the sport in Britain .

SAFETY As in all water sports safety is a main consideration. For rough water and sea canoeing a proper course which will give instruction in capsize and deep waterTescue is essential. For the placid water canoeist the main points to remember are: * Never go in a closed-cockpit kayak without first attending a course. * Learn to swim before you canoe. * Always wear a buoyancy aid. ? Never wear wellington boots or heavy clothing. * Keep awayfrom weirs unless in the presence of an instructor. * In the unlikely event of a capsize, leave the boat upside-down to form an air trap. Keep hold of the boat and swim to the side. Remember to keep hold of your paddles. a Keep out of the way of pleasure boats. Pass on the right. * Keep clear of fishermen's lines. ACCESS TO WATER On inland waterways the access problems are varied. Most rough waters rivers are privately owned. Canals and navigations usually require a licence. The BCU publish a boolS on access which includes the addresses to send to for licences. INSTRUCTION For sea and rough water canoeing there are courses throughout the country. Most clubs teach rough water canoeing. The BCU will supply the name of your nearest club and advise on courses. For an Information sheet giving names of clubs which will teach placid water canoeing send an s.a.e. to Glen Villa, Fladbury, Pershore, Hereford and Worcester. The BCU also CANOEING EVENTS A calendar is published each January by the BCU which covers all competitions for marathon, sprint, surf, slalom, wild water racing, railies and tours.

EQUIPMENT Prices for canoes and kayaks vary from about E50 secondhand to hundreds of pounds for the latest designs. The best way of choosing a canoe or kayak, having decided the type of canoeing you wish to do, is to find a club which caters for you and ask to try various craft. Paddles cost betwen £10 and £40, and buoyancy aids are about £20. The BCU publishes a buyers guide. Spa, Sept 25. Events also take place at most woekends throughout the year.

Always remember the points made above on safety and access if you are doing it yourself.

27/08/1983,19830827,krakatoa,1,"Slaving away THE ARTS Radio I suppose maany of us entertain the reassuring notion that, in the wake of William Wilber- force, and whatever else may be wrong with the wvorld, we have at least been able to leave behind us the condition in which one man actually owns another as his property. Not quite so. In The Unbroken Line (Radio 4, August 23; producer, Jock Gallagher) Adam Raphael was able to give instances not only of practices which amount to slavery (debt-bondage in India, the enticement of jobless American workers into labour camps where they are held bv force and without proper pay), but of the present day owner- ship of one human being by another. In Mauritania in West Africa, slavery was last outlawed three years agoafter several previous and unsuccessful en- actmentsand still it has not disappeared. Indeed it cannot disappear for it seems that the Mauritanian economy would collapse wvithout it. Free the slaves. compel their owners to pay them and- these owners would quite simnply be unable to do so. A few might be retained as paid servants, the restamounting to many thousandswould end up on the streets, deprived of any means of support. In such a case, at such a time, effective abolition would apparently be worse than the offence, for the slave's lot is not always wretched: there are good masters as well as bad. Raphael's other examples, though arguably not out and out slavery, were to my mind more squalid and disheartening be- cause they all involved an element of callous deceit. The Haitian authorities knowingly engage large numbers of their own black people to cut cane for the rnestizos of the neighbour- ing Dominican Republic (who don't stoop to such work) under conditions which the victims only later discover to be servitude. Indian labourers acquire anavoidable debts to tiheir landlords and are then trapped for life, never earning enough cash to discharge the debt, which may only be the equiva- lent of£ 10. We heard a landlord declare that he paid his workers not in kind but cash (as he is supposed to) and assert that they liad only told the BBC they were under debt-bondage so as to underpin their claim for government handout. No doubt it happens, but that still leaves a proportion of the landlords ,ying their heads off. Not quite ilt: programme Wilberforce might have hoped for to mark the 150th anniversary of abol- ition. That same last Tuesday was used to mark although a few days early, another anniversary, the eruption of Krakatoa, in 1883. Anyvway, Sean Maffett's Once in a blue Moon (Radio 4; producer, John Knight) was none the worse for arriving in advance. It was a most vivid reconstruction, its pictorial qualities enhanced by the inclusion of archive recordings of eye-witness survivors. Two of the week's plays sounded quite exceptionally at home in the medium of radio. Tony Flaherty's Before I am Old (Radio 4, August 23rd) told a familiar story story but did it with unusual sympathy: English Neil on a visit to Connemara encounters Mary, youngest daughter of a local working family, a relationship beauti- fully portrayed in all its early insouciance. Mary ends up pregnant; Neil does the gentle- manly thing and offers to marry her, but the community, rep- resented by the local priest, closes its solid Irish Catholic ranks on the foreigner and, to his amazement, sends him packing. The play was con- structed as a flashback in the frame of Neil's later sentimental visit to the woman he had once loved, a visit calulated to destroy all sentimental feeling, the actors (Anton Lesser and Marcella (O'Riordan) expertly conveying how each had chan- ged. Fine evocative direction by Marilyn Ireland in Belfast.

06/09/1983,19830906,krakatoa,1,"- iiscveres in,uncharted terriory 'on Many Waters National Maritime Museum' * -7.,. Galleries Quarries-a, gramden Arts Centre Krakatot Natura History Museum Talwin Morris : William:Morris Gall ry, . . . w Fair summer droops, droop men and beasts and art galleries therefore. Next week the-rentr6e starts with.& vengeance, but this' week summer visitors bent on art have really to peck around for anything new. And sometimes be very quick indeed. The Tate made its gesture towards amateurs and beginners with Summertime; showing the pick of the Womnan's Hour/Radio Tirnes ..Painting Competition, but it was there, in a tent in the garden, for a mere 12 days. Anthony d'Offay put on a small but choice show of that fascinating and still underesti- mated painter Vanessa Bell,. to celebr;ate the publication-of Frances- Spalding's new biogra- phy, and that was around for only pine. However, explorations into the wilds of Greenwich, Wal- thamstow or Swiss Cottage can still bring dividends, while those with even more daring may venture into the artistically uncharted wastes of the Natural History Museum in search . of enlightenment and entertainment. The National Maritime Mu- seum at Greenwich tends to occupy an ambiguous position in the public mind analogous to that of the Imperial War Museum: is it not, after all, primarily kid-stuff, and, moreover, the sort of reprehensible; male-chauvinist, jin'goistic outing that should not be wished upon asny daintily brought up,; liberally educated kid? The quick answer to that is no. Both museums, as well as taking their historical responsi- bilities very seriously, contain vast stores of material which, whatever its-basic theme, offers a generous amount of purely aestheticsatisfaction. The National Maritimne Museum, having recently acquired Richard Ormond from the' National Portrait Gallery, has just beguh a new series of special exhibitions dcvoted to the generally' unseen treasures of its art collecti4n with oni Many Waters (until Dcem- ber 31), a systematic and vcry well documented chronological survey of marine watercoloursmainly Britishfrom-1650 to.1930. The succession begins with the Dutch sev'cnteenth-century school, 'of whom the Van de Vcldes were thc dominant figures, and .foliows th,ir influence through the English connexion to the cigbteenth-century documen- tary watercolourists and thle early nineteenth-century Romantics and so on up (almost) to our own day. Sometimes the relationship is very evidentthere is a drawing, probably by Van de Veldc the Younger, worked up by Dominic Serres, a French naval prisoner of war who became a leading figurc in British marine art and a founder member of the Royal Academy and'handed on his special skills to his son John Thomas, who eventually found himself grandly depicting Trafal- gar from the'British point of view (an enterprise which yields one of the liveliest sketches in this slhow). Sometimes .ye are asked to compare and contrast attitudes from gencration, to gencraiion, using thesc variations on thc maritime .theme as an index to changes of.tastp and attitude in. the arts in general. There are not so many famous names (Row- landson is an exception), but many discoveries to be made, right up to a couple of beach scenes by W. L. Wyllie from the Nineties, v.ell worthy of Boudin. If, instead of Eastward Ho, we strike north towards the Camden Arts Centre, we find another theme exhibition whert docu- mentary and art are nicely balanced. Three exhibitions, to be precise, built round the general theme of Quarries (until Sep- tember 25). The combination is happy, but probably the most interesting of the three is The Road to Bethesda, a 22-year retrospective of the work of Peter Prendergast. In this case the theme of the quarries is almost coincidental, bulking so large in Prendergast's paintings largely because for the past 13 years he has lived and worked close to Bethesda. What does matter is that over the period covercd by the show, which is right from his time at the Slade up to date, Prendergast emerges gradually from the shadow of his dominating early influences, Auerbach and Bom- berg, and becomes very power- fully and convincingly his own man. The rtienacing expressionist landscapes take on a life and weight of their own, and the subtlety and intensity of colour he can find in the grey sl;ies and bare stones of industrial Wales attest to the intensity and individuality of his vision. The intentions of Miss M. E. Thompson (1896-1981), as shown in An Artist in the Quarries, seem to have been unashamedly documentary: she was recording, in a quite journalistic way, the life and work of the quarries, and their physical appearance, with an awareness that these were things likely soon to change and vanish for ever. But whatever the limitations of the original inten- tion, what emerges is often very fine in its own right, and some of the landscapes of' manmade abysses have a feeling for the sublime, over and above the merely picturesque, which sends us right back to James Ward and Gordale Scar. The third section is documentary in a different sense: a trailer for Portland Clifftop Sculpture Park, recently opened, in photographs and sketches and studies for the fullscale finished works on site. It is a pleasing show in itself, and certainly encourages one to sign on for the next coach trip. Talking of the sublime reminds me that 1883 was marked, not only by the death of Manet and Dore, which we have already marked, but also by the death of an island, Krakatoa, which literally sent reverberations round the world and provided landsca- pists, amateur and professional. with a succession of the most spectacular proto-Technicolor sunsets on record. Some of these are included in the little show the National History Museum has put on until October 25 to commemorate the centenary of the eruption on August 26 1883, which also features amazing photographs of the aftermath If the Krakatoa show provides one tiny footnote to art history. the show devoted to the work of Talwvi Morris at the William Morris Gallery in Walthamstow. until October 2, offers another, particularly apropos with all the attention presently being paid to Charles Rennie Mackintosh in Edinburgh and Glasgow. Taiwin Morris (no relation to William) was an early associate of Mackin- tosh, and designed in a very similar style, evolving at the beginning of the Nineties a spare, often rectilinear manner of graphic decoration such as represents the major British contribution to the development of international Art Nouveau. In 1893 he became art director for Blackie, the Glasgow-based publisher, and for the next 18 years himself designed or com- missioned from others the bind- ings and decorations of all their books. Since they were in the main a cheap, popular publisher, his work went generally un- marked by bibliophiles, but clearly had an immense influence on popular taste.

11/10/1983,19831011,krakatoa,1,"Rare spider warms to Isle of Wight Science report By Our Environment Correspondent A small spider hss proved an exception to the rule that Britain's wildlife is forever retreating in the face of suburban and industrial sprawl. Episintus maculipes was supposed to have been found about 50 years ago in Essex, but some modern arachnologists suspect that its supposed discoverer had really found some more common cousin. The spider is most at home In the warm climate of southern Europe. But Mr Paut Hillyard, who works in the zoology deptrtment of the Natural History Museum in London, has found a thriving colony in the Isle of Wight. He discovered the spider in the summer of 1981, collected specimens a yesr later and is convinced the colony has survived without difficulty. The spider is smaller and appears earlier than those which are now appearing on ccilings and In baths all over Britain. Autumn is prime time for spiders, epecially for large ones which weave large orb webs in gardens to catch their prey. Episinus maculipes is small and is best seen in summer. ""It is a lifte bit of a difficult spider to find"", he explained. ""It is only at night that you see this little web put up. I do not know if it has ever been established how it works"". The web is so smalt and contains so few threads of silk that researchers cannot under- stand how the hungry spider manages to catch enough food, Spiders are among the most feared and mysterious of wild crawling things, and seversIl aspects of their behaviour remain tnexplained. One is the precise nature of their ability to travel on the wvind with small threads of silk to keep them airborne. ""There are a number of good examples of spiders traveli;ng Iong distances"", Mr Hillyard said. ""A spider wvas the very first cretture to be seen alive on Krakatoa after the eruption"". His own discovery vas on the Undercliff, a piece of coastline on the south coast of the Isle of Wight vhich catches more sunshine than alm3ost any other part of Britin. Generations of spider- watchers have failed to spot Mr Hillyard's spider on the island. He therefore suspects that it wvas blowln there from one of its more usual hatnts on the Continent. He collected 12 specimens last year, but only after making sure that there were enough left to keep the population steady. ""The establishment of a consider- tble population on thz south CoRst of the Island establishes the species as an uridoubted memher of the British fauna"", he vrote in the latest Bulletin of the British Arachnologicatl Society.",English,/mnt/lustre/rfilguei/TDA_GDA_1785-2009/1983/19831011/0FFO-1983-OCT11.xml
