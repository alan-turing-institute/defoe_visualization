    of beau laiu he wa forced to fly his country however in the midft of his career

    living on the event of the moft angularbets and wager which feemed to be advantagt
    u to thofe who were curious after novelty but which were always of the moft certain
    fuccefs with regard to him he arrived at turin and propofed his fyftem to the

    the contiguous laves into contact at their inner furfaces only  fo that by driving
    the hoop hard he can make the joint muchclofer than he could pofiiblyhave done
    had the edge of the daves been fo loped a to permit them to touch each other throughout
    before being drove together by the compreffion of the hoop this together with
    giving to the daves the proper curvature feems to be the only part of the cooper

    of the feam and cannot be attended with the fmalled difficulty we think indeed

    by moft reader this drain of panegyric will be thought extravagant and of courfe

    to u calculated to produce much general good in an age like the prefent granting
    it to be true which we believe will not be granted without fome exception that

    and williamlaw and edmund law had turned the public attention of which they had
    got the entire command too much to the letter of the bible to the negledf of the

    convert with milk and not with meat when he found them unable to bear the fatter
    food and there is reafon to fufpeft that the carnal follower of warburton and
    sherlock and south were unable to bear at once fuch ftrong meat a that which make
    the fifteenth pfalm a portrait of our saviour indeed we think it not improbable
    that the mind of sherlock would have recoiled with horror from the very conception
    of the pojtbihty of jtfus chrift fwcaring to his neighbour and diiappointing him
    though that conception muff have paffed through a mind which wa certainly a pure
    a his the commentary however though truth thus compels u to fay that in our opinion

    a a writer wa bright enough whofe ikill a an interpreter wa deep enough and whole

    by moft reader this ftrain of panegyric will be thought extravagant and of courfe
    it will defeat it own purpofe  but the work is certainly a work of merit in the
    year b when the author wa vicechancellor wa publiftied in two volume to dr horne

    formed though it w t a the refult of the labour of twenty year that it will always

    to u calculated to produce much general good in an age like the prefent granting
    it to be true which we believe will not be granted without fome exception that

    got the entire command too much to the letter of the bible to the negleft of the

    wilkies life it will probably be confidered a a ftory fabricated to raife the
    scottifh poet to the fame eminence with pope whofe verfification he is allowed
    to have imitated with fuccek we have no doubt but that wilkie wrote in early life
    the defcription of a ftorm which is publilhed in the th volume of the statiftical
    account of scotland but that he wrote it in his tenth year is not proved and is
    highly improbable the poem difplays a notiona confufed notion indeedof the law
    of elericity which a boy in his tenth year and at a period when elericity wa little
    underftood could not have acquired having learned the rudiment of the latin tongue
    at thejarifhfchool of dalmeny young wilkie wa at the age of thirteen lent to the
    univerfity of edinburgh where he wa foon diftinguifhed by his originality of thought
    and by his rapid progrefs in erudition and fcience among his fellowttudent he
    wa moft clofe jy affociated with dr robartfon the hfftorian mjohn home the poet
    dr mghiea who afterwards obtained the friendfhip of johnfon and became a member
    of the ivylane club  and a mr cleghorn who promifed in which he wa afwilkie terwards
    a profeffor but died before he had time to rea rmm lize the fond hope of his friend
    during the courfe of his education wilkie became acquainted with the celebrated
    david hume and dr fergufon and at a later period with dr adam smith the farfamed
    author of  the wealth of nation of all thofe men he regarded dr fergufon with
    the greateft affeion and dr smith with the greateft admiration this laft writer
    he confidered a equal to robertfon and hume in erudition and vaftly their fuperior
    in originality and invention  and this opinion he cherifhed to the day of his
    death before he bad completed his education his father died leaving him no other
    inheritance than the ftock and unexpired leafe of his farm and the care of his
    three fifters wilkie therefore turned much of his attention to agriculture in
    which he became eminent not merely a a theorift but a a practical farmer he had
    too much fcience to be the flave of ancient prejudice and too much judgment to
    be hurried into hazardous experiment by the charm of untried fpeculation one of
    his fifters being married to a fkilful though unlettered farmer he availed himfelf
    of his brother experience and upon the fat and maxim derived from him built a
    fyftem of praftical farming which fully anfwered his own expeftation and obtained
    the applaufe of all his neighbourshe ftill profecuted his ftudies in the univerfity

    bound together by circle or hoop the merit of having invented fuch veflels is
    given by pliny to certain people who lived at the foot of the alp and who in his

    into britain is unknown to u though it is probable that we derived the art from
    the french who might have it from the roman we need hardly inform any of our reader

    the part where the junction appears to be made being the moll capacious or that
    of which the diameter is the largeft is vulgarly called the belly of the calif

    being formed of piece of timber or ftaves which are not ftraight line a in the
    cone but are curved from the vertex to the bafe in choofing his wood if he can
    have a choice the cooper prefers old and thick and ftraight tree from which he
    hews thm plank to be formed into ftaves  and in france where this art is pradlifed
    on a large fcale the winter month are allotted for the preparation of the ftaves
    and bottom and the fummer for putting them together or mounting the calk the author
    of the article in the hncyclopedie metbodique directs the cooper when drefling
    the ftaves with the plane to cut the wood always acrofs  a pradtice which we doubt
    not is proper though we think it would not be eafy to aflign the reafon of it
    plaining is the moll laborious and difficult part of the work  and there are but
    few cooper who plane quickly and at the fame time well in ihops where the work
    is diftributed into part plaining is reckoned a great objeft  and in france before
    the revolution a good plainer gained from three hillings and threepence fterling
    to four ihiilings and three farthing aday in forming the ftaves it mull never
    be forgotten that each is to conllitute part of a double conoid  that it mull
    therefore be broadeft at the middle becoming gradually though not in ftraight
    line narrower towards the extremity that the outfide acrofs the wood mull be wrought
    into the fegment of a circle  and that the have mull be thickeft near the middle
    growing thinner by very gentle degree towards the end to adjuft accurately thefe
    different curve for even the narrowing of the ftaves mull be in a curve to the
    lize and intended lhape of the calk would require either great experience or a
    larger portion of mathematical fcience than we have reafon to think that many
    cooper pofwifi f a  fl    c   cop ment of a circle or not and therefore the cooper
    very cooper feldom take that trouble copernicus the ftaves being all drefled and
    ready to be arranged in a circular form it might be thought neceffary in order
    to make the team tight to trim the thin edge which are to be joined together in
    fuch a manner a that a ray palling from the outfide of the calk through a feam
    to the centre ihould touch the contiguous ftaves from the exterior to the intenor
    fide  in other word that the thin edge ihould be hoped a the archftones of a bridge
    are hoped fo that the contiguous ftaves may be brought into firm contafl throughout
    the whole joint this however is not the pradtice of the cooper with great propriety
    he brings the contiguous ftaves into contadl at their inner furfaces only  fo
    that by driving the hoop hard he can make the joint much clofer than he could
    poffibly have done had the edge of the ftaves been fo hoped a to permit them to
    touch each other throughout before being drove together by the compreffion of
    the hoop this together with giving to the ftaves the proper curvature feems to
    be the only part of the cooper work which deferves the name ot art  for the driving
    of the hoop and the forming of the bottom could certainly be accomplilhed by any
    carpenter we had almoll faid by any man though he had never feen a hoop driven

    if add nothing to the ftrength or tightnefs of the feam and cannot be attended
    with the fmalleft difficulty we think indeed that in a large calk or tub it would
    prove injurious to the ftam  for either thefe dovetail mull be very thin flip
    raifed from the interior edge of the ftaves which in many cafe could not bedone

    reception at the univerfity of glafgow wa highly flattering and encouraging a

    in the cafe intrufted to his care made him a moft welcome vifitor in every family
    it wa between the year  and  that he biought to maturity his fpeculations concerning
    heat which had occupied his attention at interval from the ve d jvft dawn of his
    philofophical inveftigations his difcoveries in this department of fcience were
    by far the moft important of all that he made and perh ip indeed the mort valuable
    which appeared during tne bufy period of the th century to enter fully into the
    nature of his inveftigations would be improper in this place  but the fum of them
    all wa ufually exprefted by him in the following propofitions when a folid body
    is converted into a fluid there enters into it and unites with it a quantity of
    heat the prefence of which is not indicated by the  g  b l a thermometer and this
    combination is the caufe of the fluidity which the body ailumes on the other hand
    when a fluid body is converted into a folid a quantity of heat feparates from
    it the prefence of which wa not formerly indicated by the thermometer and this
    fepaiation is the caufe of the folid form which the fluid aflumes w hen a liquid
    body is raifed to the boiling temperature by the continued and copious application
    of heat it particle fuddenly attract to themfelves a great quantity of heat and
    by this combination their mutual relation is fo changed that they no longer attracft
    each other but are converted intoan elaftic fluid like air on the other hand when
    thefe elaftic fluid either by condenfation or by the application of cold body
    are reconverted into liquid they give out a vaft quantit o heat tiie prefence

    and w r ater when converted into fleam abforbs about iooo of heat without becoming
    fenfibly hotter than     philofophers had been long accuftomed to confider the
    thermometer a the fureft method of deteding heat in body yet this inftrument give
    no indication of the  of heat which enter into air when it is converted into water
    nor of the iooo which combine with water when it is converted into fleam dr black
    therefore faid that the heat is concealed latet in the water and fleam and he
    briefly expreffed this faft by calling the heat in that cafe latent heat dr black
    having eftablifhed this difcovery by ample and decifive experiment drew up an
    account of the whole inveftigation and read it to a literary fociety which met
    every friday in the facultyroom of the college confifting of the member of the
    univerfity and feveral gentleman of the city who had a relifii for philofophy

    phenomenon and in his experimental inveftigations he wa greatly aflifted by his
    two celebrated pupil mr watt and dr irvine a dr black never publifhed an account
    of his doctrine of latent heat though he detailed it every year fubfequent to  in
    his leisure which were frequented by men of fcience from all part of europe  it
    became known only through that channel and this gave an opportunity to others

    his agreeable and attradiive manner free from all liudied endeavour to pleafe
    and the kind concern he took in the cafe intrufted to his care made him a moll
    welcome vilitor in every family it wa between the year  and  that he brought to
    maturity his fpeculations concerning heat which had occupied his attention at
    interval from the very firll dawn of his philofophical inveffigations his difcoveries
    in this department of fcience were by far the moll important of all that he made
    and perhaps indeed the molt valuable which appeared during the bufy period of
    the th century io enter fully into the nature of his inveftigations would be improper
    in this place but the fum of them all wa ufually expreffed by him in the following
    propofitions when a folid body is converted into a fluid there enters into it
    and unites with it a quantity of beat the prefence of which is not indicated by
    the   b l a thermometer and this combination is the caufe of the fluidity which
    the body affumes on the other hand when a fluid body is converted into a folid
    a quantity of heat feparates from it the prefence of which wa not formerly indicated
    by the thermometer and this feparation is the caufe of the folid form which the
    fluid affumes when a liquid body is raifed to the boiling temperature by the continued
    and copious application of heat it particle fuddenly attradl to themfelves a great
    quantity of heat and by this combination their mutual relation is fo changed that
    they no longer attradt each other but are converted into an elaftic fluid like
    air on the other hand when thefe elaftic fluid either by condenfation or by the
    application of cold body are reconverted into liquid they give out a vail quantity
    of heat the prefence of which wa not formerly indicated by the thermometer thus
    water when converted into ice give out  of heat and ice when converted into water
    abforbs  of heat and water when converted into fleam abforbs about i of heat without
    becoming fenfibly hotter than  philofophers had been long accuftomed to confider
    the thermometer a the fureft method of detedling heat in body yet this inttrument
    give no indication of the  of heat which enter into air when it is converted into
    water nor of the  which combine with water when it is converted into fleam dr
    black therefore faid that the heat is concealed latet in the water and fleam and
    he briefly expreffed this fad by calling the heat in that cafe latent heat dr
    black having eflabliflied this difcovery by ample and decifive experiment drew
    up an account of the whole invefligation and read it to a literary fociety which
    met every friday in the facultyroom of the college confifting of the member of

    phenomenon and in his experimental invefligations he wa greatly affiled by his
    two celebrated pupil mr watt and dr irvine a dr black never publilhed an account
    of his doctrine of latent heat though he detailed it every year fubfequent to  in

    taken great pain for several year in the course of his lecture in refuting the
    argument and in combating the objection of meyer to his own theory dr black reception
    at the university of glasgow va highly flattering and encouraging a a student
    he had not only done himself much credit by his successful progress in the different
    pursuit in which lie wa engaged but he had also during his residence there conciliated
    the attachment and affection of the professor in a high degree when he returned
    a a professor he wa immediately connected in the strictest friendship with dr
    adam smith then professor of moral philosophy in that university and this friendship
    which now commenced grew stronger and stronger and wa never interrupted through
    the whole of their life a simplicity and sensibility an incorruptible integrity
    the strictest delicacy and correctness of manner marked the character of each
    of the philosopher and firmly bound them in the closest union at glasgow dr black
    soon acquired great reputation a a professor and became a favourite physician
    in that large and active city his engaging countenance his agreeable and attractive
    manner free from all studied endeavour to please and the kind concern he took
    in the case intrusted to his care made him a most welcome visitor in every family
    it wa between the year  and  that he brought to maturity his speculation concerning
    heat which had occupied his attention at interval from the very first dawn of
    his philosophical investigation his discovery in this department of science were
    by far the most important of all that he made and perhaps indeed the most valuable
    which appeared during the busy period of the th century to enter fully into the
    nature of his investigation would be improper in this place  but the sum of them
    all wa usually expressed by him in the following proposition when a solid body
    is converted into a fluid there enters into it and unites with it a quantity of
    heat the presence of which is not indicated by the thermometer and this combination
    is the cause of the fluidity which the body assumes on the other hand when a fluid
    body is converted into a solid a quantity of heat separate from it the presence
    of which wa not formerly indicated by the thermometer and this separation is the
    cause of the solid form which the fluid assumes when a liquid body is raised to
    the boiling temperature by the continued and copious application of beat it particle
    suddenly attract to themselves a great quantity of heat and by this combination
    their mutual relation is so changed that they no longer attract each other but
    are converted into an elastic fluid like air on the other hand when these elastic
    fluid either by condensation or by the application of cold body are reconverted
    into liquid they give out a vast quantity of heat the presence of which wa not
    formerly indicated by the thermometer thus water when converted into ice give
    out  of heat and ice when converted into water absorbs  of heat and water when
    converted into steam absorbs about iooo of heat without becoming sensibly hotter
    than  philosopher had been long accustomed to consider the thermometer a the surest
    method of detecting heat in body yet this instrument give no indication of the  of
    heat which enter into air when it is converted into water nor of the loco  which
    combine with water when it is converted into steam dr black therefore said that
    the heat is concealed latet in the water and steam and he briefly expressed this
    fact by calling the heat in that case latent heat dr black having established
    this discovery by simple and decisive experiment drew up an account of the whole
    investigation and read it to a literary society which met every friday in the
    facultyroom of the college consisting of the member of the university and several
    gentleman of the city who had a relish for philosophy and literature this wa done
    april   a appears by the register this doctrine wa immediately applied by it author
    to the explanation of a vast number of natural phenomenon and in his experimental
    investigation he wa greatly assisted by his two celebrated pupil mr watt and dr
    irvine a dr black never published an account of his doctrine of latent heat though
    he detailed it every year subsequent to  in his lecture which were frequented
    by men of science from all part of europe j it became known only through that
    channel and this gave an opportunity to others to pilfer it from him piecemeal
    dr crawford idea respecting the capacity of body for heat were originally derived
    from dr black who first pointed out the method of investigating that subject the
    investigation of lavoisier and laplace concerning heat published many year after
    were obviously borrowed from dr black and indeed consisted in the repetition of
    the very experiment which he had suggested yet these philosopher never mention
    dr black at all  every thing in their dissertation assumes the air of originality  and
    indeed they appear to have been at great pain to prevent the opinion and discovery
    of dr black from being known among their countryman but perhaps the most extraordinary
    procedure wa that of mr deluc j this philosopher had expressed

    constitution and of preserving it in health and vigour  when grinded into meal

    principal the rest consisting chiefly of carrot turnip and parsnip are never used
    a a sole nutriment being rather adopted for the purpose of giving variety and
    relish to other food and chiefly to butcher meat the potato however is in some
    measure an exception to this general rule it contains a large quantity of starch
    which doe not seem inferior to the starch prepared from wheat so far at least
    a that ingredient is to be regarded a contributing to the nourishing quality of
    the grain it taste resembles more nearly than any other root the taste of bread  and
    accordingly it is daily beginning to be more extensively used and to form a larger

    to the stomach by their bulkiness and their tendency to injure the power of digestion
    by producing flatulency and other unpleasant consequence s on the whole the difference
    between these succulent wherei root and the grain of corn plant seems to amount

    to barley after it ha been converted into malt yet a the root are formed in the
    bosom of the soil and are of a loose and watery texture their formation tequires
    from nature a slighter effort than the bringing to perfection the small grain
    which are produced in the air at the top of corn plant she therefore compensates

    principle to be in many respect erroneous  and he investigated the effect of the
    division of labour and various other circumstance which had not occurred to any
    former writer although the system of smith gave general satisfaction to all who
    were able to investigate the subject and though it wa even adopted by mr pitt

    celebrated journal by illustrating in a popular manner the leading subject of
    political economy and by beating down with it keen power of ridicule the opinion

    locke theory and to point out the real cause why it application to practice failed
    a it is generally acknowledged that it did  the greater portion ot the silver
    recoinage having before the year  disappeared from the circulation by an abstract
    account of the price which the bank of england paid for gold and silver bullion
    in each year from  to  it appears that a early a  they paid l  per oz for standard
    gold and s d for standard silver and it is probable that the same price existed
    at a more early date after the recoinage though the account state no price before  this
    account we conceive of very great importance and we think will satisfactorily
    explain why mr locke theory did not permanently produce the effect which the legislature
    expected from it by a reference to the price paid for gold by the bank of england
    from  to  it appears that the average priceoz wa l  s lid during this period the
    guinea wa current for s d at which rate the oz of gold wa coined into l  s d for
    if one guinea or  dvvts fgrs be worth s d  grs or  oz will be worth l  s fd it
    would appear then that the market price of gold wa only d above it mint price  and
    some debasement by wear may have existed upon the gold currency at this period
    causing such excess of the mint price while the mint therefore coined gold at
    the rate of l s h per oz and silver at s d the relative proportion wa a  to  there
    is only one quotation of silver given for the period in question and it is s d
    per oz if we take this a the average price for the seven year in question and
    we may be justified in doing so by the market price which follow in  and subsequent
    year a extracted from castaigns paper and laid before the house of common and
    ordered to be printed th march  at s sa per oz the average proportion of gold
    and silver in the market would be  to  but no individual would carry  ozs of silver
    to the mint to be coined into about l s d when these  of silver would procure
    an ounce of standard gold in the market which could be coined into l  s fd making
    thereby a profit of about l  s per cent while this profit continued it may reasonably
    be inferred that gold and not silver would be the standard of our money it wa
    in september  that sir isaac newton delivered in his report to the lord of the
    treasury giving it a his opinion that gold wa considerably overrated in the mint
    with respect to silver and in consequence of this report the guinea w t a by proclamation
    dated d december  declared current at s it is of importance to observe the effect
    produced upon the price of gold by this proclamation  and we are of opinion it
    will completely prove that the silver currency had not operated a the standard
    of value during the period in question when the guinea became a legal tender at
    s the price of gold became fixed at l s per oz at the mint for if  dwts f grs
    be worth s  grs or  oz will be worth l s d this  fall in the price of gold from
    l s d is coinage is d per oz and is equal to about l  s per cent it appears by
    the abstract of price paid for bullion by the bank of england that in and subsequent
    year they paid l  sper oz for standard gold which is a fall from l s fd of is
    jd pier oz and if an allowance is made for the debasement by wear existing at
    this period upon the gold coin the fall in the market price of gold will be equal
    to the reduction in the value of the guinea but this effect could not have been
    produced unless gold at the period in question had been the measure of value and
    a such the measure of it own price from these fact we think the conclusion may
    be justified that from  and probably a more early period after the recoinage to
    the date of sir i newton report the gold money of this country wa the standard
    measure of property and that the reduction of the value of the guinea thereby
    making the relative proportion of gold and silver approximate nearer to those
    of the market wa the first step of which we have an authentic record taken by
    government to maintain the principle of mr locke theory and a the avowed intention
    of this report wa to give that rise in value to the silver coin which would protect
    it from the melting pot and which could be done by lowering that of gold it may
    be inferred that the legislature were aware that the gold coin had attained the
    prerogative of being the standard of value at this time though the recommendation
    in sir i newton report wa carried into effect by making the guinea current at
    s yet it did not restore silver to it function a the standard of our money and
    this because the current value wa not made still lower sir i newton seemed aware
    of this himself and recommended that lod or d should be taken from the guinea
    instead of d this however wa not done and a the rate of s to the guinea the proportion
    of standard gold to standard silver at the mint wa a  to  the proportion of the
    market a w r e find by the price of gold and silver at this period in castaigns
    paper wa about d to   which constitutes a difference of about  per cent gold being
    still thus much rated above it value to silver and consequently not only wa no
    silver coined but the good and heavy coin were still melted for the high price
    they brought in the state of bullion it is surprising that the government having
    seen the operation of the principle recommended in the report of sir i newton
    did not carry it a little further and bring the current value of the guinea to
    a par with the market proportion of the tw r o metal and so render it the interest
    of the public to carry silver to the mint to be coined before concluding our observation
    upon this highly interesting subject we must remark that the great mr locke himself
    did not impute the high price of silver after the recoinage to the cause to which
    we have here assigned it he attributed it to the permission of exporting silver
    bullion and to the prohibition of exporting silver coin this permission he said
    rendered the demand for silver bullion greater than the demand for silver coin

    reasoning tribute to the mother country and that voluntarily  because the mother
    country may be of use to it that we may answer is a bargain not a tribute the
    mother country for example may yield a certain portion of defence but the colony
    is saved from the expence of providing for itself that defence which it receives
    from the mother country and make a good bargain if it get it from the mother country
    cheaper than it would be provided by itself in this case too the expence incurred
    by the mother country is apt to be a very full equivalent for the tribute received
    it is evident that this sort of bargain may subsist between any two state whose
    circumstance it may suit and is not confined to a mother and daughter country
    it is therefore no part of the question relating to colony  we have now investigated
    the first of the mode in which a colony considered a territory merely may be expected
    to benefit the mother country  and we have seen the chance of good which it affords
    we shall now proceed to investigate the second  the trade by mean of which it
    is supposed that colony may benefit the mother country this is a topic of some
    importance  for it is on account of the trade that colony have remained an object
    of affection to englishman it is on account of trade solely that the colony in
    the west indie are valued it is indeed true that some idea of something like a
    tribute from the east indie ha till this time maintained a place in the mind of
    the unthinking part of the community but still it is the trade which ha been supposed
    to be the principal source of the advantage which ha been ascribed to what we
    call  the british empire in the east dr adam smith produce a long train of reasoning
    to prove that it never can be advantageous to a country to maintain colony merely
    for the sake of their trade in the idea of deriving a peculiar advantage from
    the trade of the colony is necessarily included the idea of monopoly if the trade
    of the colony were to be free other nation would derive a much advantage from
    it a the mother country  and the mother country would derive a much advantage
    from it if the colony were not a colony dr smith affirms that this monopoly can
    never be of any advantage  must always on the contrary be a source of great disadvantage
    to the mother country he argues thusto make the monopoly advantageous to the mother
    country it must enable the mother country to buy cheaper or sell dearer in the
    colony than it would otherwise have done in other word it must enable the mother
    country to obtain the good of the colony for a smaller quantity of her own good
    than she could without the monopoly this in the opinion of dr smith it doe not
    belong to the monopoly to accomplish the monopoly he say may enable the mother
    country to make other nation pay dearer for the good of the colony but it cannot
    enable her to buy them cheaper this he seems to take a a postulate without attempting
    much to support it by reasoning the extension of the market he say by which he
    must mean the vol in part i competition of capital would in a state of freedom
    reduce the profit of stock in the colony to their lowest term under a monopoly
    he seems to think that profit of stock in the colony is apt to remain above that
    level and he assumes that the term on which the mother country deal with the colony
    must depend upon the rate of profit in the colony having on these ground assumed
    the impossibility of deriving any advantage from the monopoly of the colonial
    trade dr smith proceeds to represent a variety of disadvantage which he think
    it ha a necessary tendency to produce his argument is that the monopoly of the
    colonial trade necessarily raise the profit of stock in the mother country and
    that  whatever to use his own expression  raise in any country the ordinary rate
    of profit higher than it otherwise would be necessarily subject that country both
    to an absolute and to a relative disadvantage in every branch of trade of which
    she ha not the monopoly to prove the first of these proposition he say that by
    the monopoly of the trade of any colony foreign capital is driven from it the
    capital of the trade is thus made deficient the profit of the capital is for that
    reason increased the increase of profit in the colony draw capital from the mother
    country the departure of capital from the mother country make the portion of capital
    in the mother country deficient and hence raise in the mother country the profit
    of stock to prove the second of the proposition he say that high profit produce
    high price  and that high price diminish produce to afford her merchant the high
    profit in question the country must pay dearer for the good she import and must
    sell dearer those which she export she must therefore he infers  both buy le and
    sell le  must both enjoy le and produce le than she otherwise would do nor is
    this all other nation who do not subject themselves to this disadvantage to this
    diminution of produce may advance faster and thus attain a superiority which they
    would not otherwise have enjoyed and there is still a worse evil  by raising the
    price of her produce above what it would otherwise be it enables the merchant
    of other country to undersell her in foreign market and thereby to justle her
    out of almost all those branch of trade of which she ha not the monopoly to this

    much emotion u i can only say of you a hamlet did of fontinbras he ha my dying
    voice mr ferguson entered on his new duty with a degree of spirit and activity
    from which the most splendid result were to be anticipated in one particular his
    mode of lecturing wa singular and not easily imitated after having delineated
    the general plan of his course and committed it to writing he resolved not to
    write a system of lecture but to endeavour to make himself master of every part
    of his subject and to trust to the moment of delivery for the expression of his
    sentiment this method of discoursing wa in his hand very happily executed  but
    it success depended in a great measure on the state of his health and spirit a
    well a upon the interest excited by the different subject of discussion perhaps
    no lecturer with the exception of his immediate successor wa ever more admired
    his class wa crowded by great number of gentleman of high rank and official station
    a well a by younger student in the mean time eagerly a he applied to the discharge
    of his professional duty his attention w r a extended to other branch of inquiry  and
    within little more than a year after he commenced his labour a a lecturer on moral
    he sent to the press his essay on the history of civil society  a work which wa
    received with an expression of public applause which even exceeded the high expectation
    of his friend  fergusons book say mr hume writing to dr robertson from london
    go on here with great success gray the poet say  there are uncommon strain of
    eloquence in it and i wa surprised to find not one single idiom of his country
    i think in the whole work mr hume in a letter to the author dated th march  congratulates
    him on the success of the book adding that he had  met with nobody that had read
    it who did not praise it lord mansfield is very loud to that purpose in his sunday
    society i heard lord chesterfield and lord lyttleton express the same sentiment
    and wffiat is above all caddel i am told is already projecting a second edition
    of the same quarto size mr hume then informs him that lord shelburne and lord
    bute were among his most zealous partizan the last declaring the book one of the
    best he ever read charles townshend appears to have been of the same opinion a
    he read it five time over general clerk had pressed the author to dedicate his
    work to lord shelburne who had signified his intention of offering mr ferguson
    the government of west florida upon which occasion his lordship laughed very heartily
    when the general expressed his conviction that mr ferguson wa more usefully employed
    a a teacher of science the book however appeared without any dedication in the
    course of the following year lord shelburne intimated a hope of getting mr ferguson
    established with a proper appointment at oxford  and some other person of influence
    meditated a design of employing him in one of the department of state this puipose
    wa frusvol iv part i per  trated in all probability by a temper which did ferguson
    not permit him to accommodate himself to the view of those whose maxim of conduct
    he did not entirely approve another circumstance may be considered a having also
    operated to obstruct the fulfilment of the scheme which were devised for his advancement
    at this time he married miss burnet a young lady nearly connected with his mother
    family and still more nearly related to his intimate friend dr black soon afterwards
    he began to cultivate a farm in the parish of currie and at a considerable sacrifice
    of private interest gratified his taste for improvement by transforming a barren
    heath into a scene which became distinguished for beauty and fertility it wa impossible
    however for any combination of circumstance to abate his literary activrty  and
    he not only continued to conduct the business of his class with unremitted diligence
    but seized every interval of leisure which he could command to collect material
    for a history of the roman commonwealth while he wa proceeding in his research
    he wa solicited by philip earl of stanhope the editor of dr robert simsons posthumous
    work and the other guardian of charles earl of chesterfield to superintend the
    education of that young nobleman then in his nineteenth year the negociation wa
    conducted through the mediation of dr adam smithwho judging the offer to be advantageous
    to his friend exerted himself with great earnestness to induce him to accept it
    lord stanhope wa extiemely anxious to obtain the able service of dr ferguson without
    delay a he conceived it to be of the utmost consequence to his young kinsman to
    be placed under the care of  a person so well qualified to complete the remaining
    part of his education and to repair the neglect omission and error which had unfortunately
    been committed in the former part of it the proposal had originally been made
    early in the year  and wa renewed in december soon after the commencement of the
    session of the college when dr ferguson wa engaged not only in teaching his own
    class but also in lecturing on natural philosophy the professorship of which had
    recently become vacant by the death of his relation mr russell he wa not able
    to prevail on the patron to accept of a substitute to complete the labour of that
    session  but after obtaining leave of absence for the next session he joined his
    young charge at geneva in may  and at first entertained hope that his labour might
    prove beneficial the connection however wa not so agreeable a he expected and
    it terminated about twelve month afterwards in the mean time he had very nearly
    been deprived of his office in the university the towncouncil had at his desire
    appointed mr john bruce then assistant and afterwards successor to mr stevenson

    of the session they thought fit jto rescind this act and to declare the office
    vacant his friend in the university particularly drs robertson blair and black

    the object of their mission  but they had an opportunity of acquiring more useful
    information of the state and temper of the country than government had received

    session   h  place wa supplied by mr dugald stewart who about five year afterwards
    wa destined to succeed him in the chair of moral philosophy in the year  he wa
    seized with an attack of apoplexy which though not violent wa sufficient to alarm
    his friend for his safety this formidable affection did not in the slightest degree
    impair the force of his understanding and so abstemious did he afterwards become
    a not only to secure himself against the recurrence of the dise ase but to enjoy
    almost uninterrupted health for more than thirty year a he could not now venture
    to lecture a formerly without the use of written note he therefore found it necessary
    to write out a course of instruction to be read during the remainder of his incumbency
    in his endeavour torecover the substance of his lecturesj he availed himself of

    mode in which he had staled his doctrine and the different argument and illustration
    by which he had happened to supply in one session what might have been omitted
    in another but in the prospect of soon relinquishing his office it wa scarcely
    conceivable that the compilation which he thus executed could posse all the excellency

    studious of impressing the lesson of wisdom which may be gathered from the survey
    of distant age the fatigue and anxiety of public teaching now became oppressive
    to his spirit and not altogether favourable to his health  and he therefore deemed
    it expedient to resign his office in  when he had completed his sixtyfirst year
    mr dugald stewart then professor of mathematics succeeded to his office and in

    note of his lecture on ethic and politics with a view to publication and in  the
    work appeared under the title of principle of moral and political science though
    composed under disadvantageous circumstance and though it ha omitted many of the
    question which were treated in his elementary course it contains an admirable
    view of the system both of ancient and modern philosopher particularly on the
    foundation of moral approbation and the source of private happiness and public
    security the author to whose suggestion he wa most indebted were xenophon plato

    the new road containing an immense population almost entirely cut olf from the
    use of fish the only argument in favour of keeping back the fish and throwing
    them overboard is the frequent westerly wind which prevents the fishingvessels
    from proceeding to the market up the thames but that excuse is now done away by
    the numerous steamvessels which could easily tow up the fishing boat iand the
    supply a we have stated is inexhaustible id be and the mean are within our reach
    of availing ourt  self to any extent of that supply  but the de uie mand appears
    obviously to be neither so steady and certain nor so extensive a it might and
    ought to be  and hence the real cause of the failure of all the plan for extending
    the fishery when the catch wa abundant the fisherman had no home market to take
    the fish off their hand and a bad season impoverished the fund of those who had
    embarked on a larger scale for the foreign market the promoter dissatisfied withheld
    their contribution and the fisherman dispirited and without capital directed their
    industry into another channel and too frequently from their knowledge gained of
    the opposite coast and new connection formed there into a channel destructive
    to their moral and injurious to the revenue ervations the encouragement given
    by the government in hebounthe shape of bounty wa not sufficient to counteract
    the evil that have been stated and appears to have contributed but little to the
    success of the fishery if a branch of trade once fairly established will not support
    itself without being bolstered up by bounty it never can be worth carrying on
    bounty should only be continued for a definite time and decreased gradually those
    on the fishery should be given on the quantity procured and the quality of those
    cured and not on the instrument of their productionon the fish and not on the
    vessel it wa proved by a committee of the house of common in  that the herringfishery
    absolutely cost little short of l annually which on an average of ten year wa
    equal to l per cent on the value of all the fish that had been taken by the vessel
    on which it wa paid adam smith ha justly observed that a tonnagebounty proportioned
    to the burden of the ship and not to her diligence and success in the fishery
    is not the best stimulus to exertion  it wa an encouragement for fitting out ship
    to catch not the fish but the bounty or to induce rash adventurer to engage in
    concern which they do not understand and cause them to lose by their ignorance
    more than is gained by the liberality of government the carelessness ot such person
    and the ignorance of those employed by them in curing and packing the fish not
    only robbed the public purse but destroyed the character of the article in the
    foreign market where if saleable at all it fetched only an inferior price while
    the skill and atteniion of the dutch secured for their fish that preference to
    which they were justly entitled ihe change of the bounty however from the tonnage
    to the quantity and the quality of the fish caught and cured with the regulation
    adopted by the act ot th and th geo iii have had the good effect of fishery raising
    the character and consequently increasing the demand for british fish in the foreign
    market where the herring in particular are now held in equal esteem with those

    herring branded by the proper officer and s a barrel granted by the act th geo
    iii c  and is so considerable that at this time it amount to a sum not le than

    of shifting the bounty from the tonnage to the actual quantity of fish taken gutted
    and packed than the following official return for the year ending th april   an
    account of the total number of vessel including their repeated voyage which have
    been cleared outwards for the british herringfishery not on the tonnage bounty

    of benvie in forfarshire in which place he wa born on the th of march  he resided
    at home under the domestic tuition of his father till the age of fourteen when
    he entered at the university of st andrew and wa almost immediately distinguished
    not merely for his singular proficiency in mathematical learning hut for the extent
    of his general knowledge the dearness of his judgment and the dignity and propriety
    of his conduct a remarkable testimony to  this effect ha been lately made public
    in an early letter of the late principal george hill who wa at this time one of
    his fellow student and wa himself so remarkable for early talent that we find
    it retarded of him that he had privately composed an excellent sermon in the tenth
    year of his age  a youth of this description cannot be supposed to have been very
    indulgent in his estimate of the merit of bi competitor and it could therefore
    have been no ordinary measure of ability that called forth the following ingenuous
    avowal in a confidential letter to his mother   playfair ha very great merit and
    more knowledge and a better judgment than any of his class fellow i make no exception  my
    part might be more showy and the kind of reading to which my inclination led me
    wa calculated to enable me to make a better figure at st andrew but in judgment
    and understanding i wa greatly inferior to him dr cook life of principal hill
    it is scarcely a stronger though undoubtedly a very different proof of his rare
    attainment that when the professor of natural philosophy wilkie the once celebrated
    author of the epigoniad wa prevented by indisposition from delivering the regular
    lecture he used generally to delegate the task of instruction to his youthful
    pupil wilkie besides being a scholar and philosopher of no mean note wa a man
    of primitive benevolence and ptegrity and of great vivacity in conversation and
    the friendship which in spite of the disparity of their year wa speedily formed
    between him and young playfair speaks a much for the social and moral character
    of the latter a his substitution of him in the classroom doe for his early p l
    a proficiency in science on this last subject we pfktr shall mention but one fact
    more in  when only eighteen year of age he offered himself with the approbation
    of his instructor at st andrew a candidate for the professorship of mathematics
    in mareschal college aberdeen and sustained with the most distinguished credit
    an examination or comparative trial which lasted eleven day and embraced nearly
    the whole range of the exact science out of the six competitor who entered the

    ha long filled it with much reputation in  he removed to edinburgh where his merit
    and modesty very soon introduced him to the friendship of dr robertsonadam smithdr

    the utmost cordiality during the whole period of their life in  he wa a candidate
    for the professorship of natural philosophy at st andrew vacant by the death of
    his friend dr wilkie there wa no comparative trial on this occasion and he wa
    again unsuccessful under circumstance which have led one of the most dutiful son
    of that university dr cook in his life of principal hill to remark  how much  it
    suffered in thus losing a man by whose talent it reputation would have been so
    highly promoted in the course of the same year the death of his father suddenly
    devolved upon him the burden of supporting the family and admonished him no longer
    to delay the final election of a profession he had been educated with a view to
    the church and wa every way qualified to accept a living on the establishment
    but his decided predilection for science had hitherto made him hesitate about
    engaging in a vocation the duty of which he felt if conscientiously discharged
    would necessarily interfere to a great extent with the study he wa loth to abandon
    in this emergency however he thought himself no longer entitled to indulge in
    those predilectionsand accordingly made application to lord gray the patron for
    a presentation to the living of liff and benvie which had been filled by his father
    his lordship wa too well aware of his merit to hesitate about conferring so great
    a benefit on the parishioner and immediately issued a presentation in his favour
    although from some challenge of his right to the patronage induction wa not obtained

    known professor of greek and he acquired such a knowledge of these language a
    served to constitute him a correct classical scholar through life he pursued his
    study with so much attention a to obtain the approbation of his teacher and the
    admiration of his contemporary who were delighted with the originality and ingenuity
    of his conversation though he did not himself reflect with perfect satisfaction
    upon the degree of application which he had exerted in his academical education
    he took a degree of master of art in  having studied mathematics under dr robert
    simson and moral philosophy under dr adam smith the example of so correct and
    rigid a follower of the ancient method of demonstration a dr simson must unquestionably
    have exercised considerable influence on his yet unformed taste in mathematics  but
    he seems to have had a natural preference either from the constitution of his
    mind or from some previously acquired habit of thinking for the geometrical method  for
    we are informed that  he first attracted the regard of dr simson by owning his
    dislike of algebra and by returning a neat geometrical solution of a problem which
    had been given out to the class in an algebraical form  with this mode of solution
    the professor wa delighted though the pupil candidly acknowledged that it had
    been adopted only because he could not solve the problem in the manner required
    of the class he had imbibed in the course of his study an insuperable aversion
    to the pursuit of his original object in the church  not certainly from any want
    of religious feeling or from a dislike to the kind of life that wa intended for
    him but probably from some difficulty that had occurred to him respecting particular
    point of doctrine or of practice he wa therefore compelled to provide himself
    with some other occupation and he readily accepted the offer of some of his friend

    scheme for sending prince edward the young duke of york to complete his professional
    education at sea in company with a son of admiral knowles and mr robison wa to
    have instructed his royal highness in mathematics and navigation he wa much disappointed
    on his arrival in london to find that the expedition had never been seriously
    intended and he readily accepted an engagement to attend young knowles a a private
    tutor when he went a a midshipman on board of the neptune of  gun with admiral
    saunders who had the command of a force intended to cooperate with general wolfe
    in the reduction of quebec and upon the appointment of his friend a a lieuteroblson  nant

    into the admiral ship under the command of lieutenant knowles in this capacity
    he had an opportunity of seeing considerable service and of making some survey
    of the river and of the neighbouring country an employment for which he wa perfectly
    qualified both a a geometrician and a a draughtsman he also remarked  the effect
    of the aurora borealis on the compass which had been noticed by mairan and wargentin

    signalised by the victory and death of the gallant wolfe the royal william sailed

    wa sent to cruise off cape finisterre but in six month she wa obliged to return
    home from having the greater part of the men disabled by the scurvy he used to
    consider the two year that he spent on board of the royal william a the happiest
    of his life and no inconsiderable part of his gratification wa derived from the
    study of seamanship a he saw it practised under the auspex of captain hugh pigot
    he did not however acquire any firm attachment to the mode of life which he had
    temporarily adopted he wa rather disposed to resume his academical pursuit and
    he had overcome his earlier objection to the ecclesiastical profession he could
    not however refuse the friendly invitation of admiral knowles to come and live
    with him in the country and to assist him in some important experiment which he
    wa making upon mechanical and nautical subject  in the month of february  lieutenant
    knowles wa appointed to the peregrine sloop of  gun and mr robison accompanied
    him with the hope of becoming a purser he visited lisbon and several other part
    of portugal but he found a cruise in a small ship much le convenient and agreeable
    than in a large one and fortunately for himself and for mankind he finally quitted
    the peregrine and the naval service in june and returned to live with admiral

  text: 'colony  colony tribute to the mother country and that voluntarily because
    the mother country may be of use to it that we may answer is a bargain not a tribute
    the mother country for example may yield a certain portion of defence but the
    colony is saved from the expence of providing for itself that defence which it
    receives from the mother country and make a good bargain if it get it from the
    mother country cheaper than it would be provided by itself in this case too the
    expence incurred by the mother country is apt to be a very full equivalent for
    the tribute received it is evident that this sort of bargain may subsist between
    any two state whose circumstance it may suit and is not confined to a mother and
    daughter country it is therefore no part of the question relating to colony inquiry
    a  we have now investigated the first of the to the admodes in which a colony
    considered a territory vantage to merely may be expected to benefit the mother
    trade b  v country  and we have seen the chance of good which it affords we shall
    now proceed to investigate the second  the trade by mean of which it is supposed
    that colony may benefit the mother country this is a topic of some importance  for
    it is on account of the trade that colony have remained an object of affection
    to englishman it is on account of trade solely that the colony in the west indie
    are valued it is indeed true that some idea of something like a tribute from the
    east indie ha till this time maintained a place in the mind of the unthinking
    part of the community but still it is the trade which ha been supposed to be the
    principal source of the advantage which ha been ascribed to what we call  the
    british empire in the east dr adam smith produce a long train of reasoning to
    prove that it never can be advantageous to a country to maintain colony merely
    for the sake of their trade view of dr l n the idea of deriving a peculiar advantage
    from smuhs  tra j e  f t h e colony is necessarily included the easomngs  jf t  ie
    trade of the colony were to be free other nation would derive a much advantage
    from it a the mother country  and the mother country would derive a much advantage
    from it if the colony were not a colony dr smith affirms that this monopoly can
    never be of any advantage  must always on the contrary be a source of great disadvantage
    to the mother country he argues thusto make the monopoly advantageous to the mother
    country it must enable the mother country to buy cheaper or sell dearer in the
    colony than it would otherwise have done in other word it must enable the mother
    country to obtain the good of the colony for a smaller quantity of her own good
    than she could without the monopoly this in the opinion of dr smith it doe not
    belong to the monopoly to accomplish the monopoly he say may enable the mother
    country to make other nation pay dearer for the good of the colony but it cannot
    enable her to buy them cheaper this he seems to take a a postulate without attempting
    much to support it by reasoning the extension of the market he say by which he
    must mean the vol nr part i competition of capital would in a state of freedom
    cwony reduce the profit of stock in the colony to their lowest term under a monopoly
    he seems to think that profit of stock in the colony is apt to remain above that
    level and he assumes that the term on which the mother country deal with the colony
    must depend upon the rate of profit in the colony having on these ground assumed
    the impossibility of deriving any advantage from the monopoly of the colonial
    trade dr smith proceeds to represent a variety of disadvantage which he think
    it ha a necessary tendency to produce his argument is that the monopoly of the
    colonial trade necessarily raise the profit of stock in the mother country  and
    that  whatever to use his own expression  raise in any country the ordinary rate
    of profit higher than it otherwise would be necessarily subject that country both
    to an absolute and to a relative disadvantage in every branch of trade of which
    she ha not the monopoly to prove the first of these proposition he say that by
    the monopoly of the trade of any colony foreign capital is driven from it the
    capital of the trade is thus made deficient the profit of the capital is for that
    reason increased the increase of profit in the colony draw capital from the mother
    country the departure of capital from the mother country make the portion of capital
    in the mother country deficient and hence raise in the mother country the profit
    of stock to prove the second of the proposition he say that high profit produce
    high price and that high price diminish produce to afford her merchant the high
    profit in question the country must pay dearer for the good she import and must
    sell dearer those which she export she must therefore he infers  both buy le and
    sell le  must both enjoy le and produce le than she otherwise would do nor is
    this all other nation who do not subject themselves to this disadvantage to this
    diminution of produce may advance faster and thus attain a superiority which they
    would not otherwise have enjoyed and there is still a worse evil  by raising the
    price of her produce above what it would otherwise be it enables the merchant
    of other country to undersell her in foreign market and thereby to justle her
    out of almost all those branch of trade of which she ha not the monopoly to this
    reasoning dr smith anticipates an objection it may be affirmed that the colony
    trade is more advantageous than any other trade and though it may be true according
    to the reasoning of smith that the monopoly of the colony trade ha diminished
    the amount of trade which the mother country r which england for example ha been
    able to carry on in other channel england ha lost nothing because she ha exchanged
    a le profitable for a more profitable employment of her capital in answer to this
    objection dr smith endeavour to prove that the employment into which the capital
    of england is forced by the monopoly is le advantageous to the country than that
    into which it would have gone of it own accord a the foundation of his reasoning

    if it go to the whole extent of that protection there is to the purpose in question
    no balance at all if it doe not go to the whole extent there will still be some

    private interest of those who share among them the governing power are concerned
    but it is only from the private interest of those who govern that the nation ha
    any thing to fear it is only against these interest that the balance is provided
    a far however a these private interest are concerned the balance doe not exist
    a far therefore a the balance is even supposed to be of any service the balance
    is excluded by the law of nature it follows a a corollary that in a country where
    the people depend upon what is called a balance a the whole of their security
    for good government they have no security at all such is the analysis which the
    economist present of the cause of good and evil in human society and of that order
    of thing which best insures the presence of the one and the absence of the other
    that part of their doctrine which alone is yet known to the mere english reader
    their political economy is introduced a only an auxiliary exposition it is part
    of the developement by which they endeavoured to prove the identity which they
    supposed between the interest of the sovereign and the interest of the people
    but a a very distinct account of this part of their system ha been given by dr
    adam smith and ha been repeated in a variety of publication  and a our object
    rather wa the exhibition of those doctrine of the sect which nobody ha yet presented
    to our countryman in their own language we shall content ourselves with only marking
    the place which their political economy held in their general system a the society
    ha public expences it is necessary that it also have a public revenue to reconcile
    the formation of a public revenue with the idea of social order it ought to be
    formed if possible without infringing the property of individual for the sake
    of which the order of society itself is established it ought therefore if possible
    to be formed without diminishing the revenue of individual when the real origin
    of revenue the source from which it all is drawn is sufficiently understood the
    mode of forming a revenue for the sovereign without diminishing that of individual
    would be immediately apparent the source of all rich is the land  because the
    land alone of all the source of production yield a produce greater than the cost
    of the production the surplus produce of the land therefore constitutes a fund
    which is over and above t ie remuneration to the agent of production and out o
    w nch the revenue of the sovereign may be taken without diminishing the motive
    to production that is without retarding the natural progress of the economics
    state in wealth population and felicity  to lay the foundation for this plan of
    a public revenue it wa necessary to prove that the land is the only source of
    production  and that manufacture and ctminferce though they alter the form of
    thing never add any thing to the amount or value of production in the developement
    of these view one of the most remarkable result at which the economist arrived
    wa the necessity of perfect freedom to all the proceeding which lead to production
    a giving to produce that form which is most agreeable to those who are to make
    use of it till th time of the economist the necessity of holding those proceeding
    in chain and binding them to the wall of government wa the universal doctrine
    of government and to a great degree of speculator themselves the general principle
    of the economist respecting the freedom of property necessary to constitute the
    foundation of social order led them to infer the evil of those abridgment of freedom  but
    they examined the inference in detail and showed that the meddling officiousness
    of government to compel industry to one thing and exclude it from another not
    only failed to effect any good purpose but of necessity created obstruction of
    the greatest magnitude to production in general and tended powerfully to keep
    down the wealth population and prosperity of the state the light which they diffused
    on this subject and which soon produced a grand effect on the mind of men wa a
    good the magnitude of which is beyond calculation another of their conclusion
    is that the revenue of the sovereign taken a they said it ought to be wholly from
    the net produce of the land ought to be a fixed and unalterable proportion of
    that produce the reason appeared to them conclusive if the proportion wa variable
    and depended upon the will of the owner of the land they might be induced to break
    upon the public revenue and deprive the state of those benefit which the public
    revenue is necessary to produce if it depended upon the sovereign the property
    of the land might be detached from that of it produce  no body would have a motive
    to become a proprietor in land and all the advantage wdiich depend on the existence
    of that property would be lost the production of subsistence would fail and the
    community could not exist this proportion being once fixed there is no longer
    any contrariety between the interest of the sovereign and the interest of any
    portion of his people and the proprietor of land are a completely and securely
    exempt from contributing to the expence of the state a any other class of the
    community the sovereign derives no part of his revenue from the subject and this
    deplorable source of the conflict of interest is wholly cut off the proportion
    being settled for ever between the sovereign and the landowner that alone is the
    property of the landowner which is the proportion remaining to him  he rest is
    with regard to him a if it did not exist the sovereign they denominated therefore
    co pro prietor ot the land and between him and the ianucwner commonly so called

    that the legislative and executive power must always be exercised by the same
    hand they affirm that those power could only be exercised by those who had in
    their hand the superiority of the physical force observe now the legitimate conclusion     the
    people alone have the physical force necessary to constitute them guardian of
    the law the same force is necessary for the maker and the executor of the law
    no body therefore but the people ever can accurately speaking have either the
    legislative or the executive powersin a state of ignorance they may be led by
    fraud to lend their power to their own destruction but it is a part also of the
    doctrine of the economist that in a state of knowledge in which they may be easily
    placed it is not possible they should make any but a good use of their power  a
    nation they said  governed according to the natural and essential order of society
    ha necessarily the perfect evidence and knovyledge of it and therefore see with
    certainty that it enjoys it best possible situation this perception of necessity
    unites all the will and all the force in the nation for the support of that order
    and by consequence for the creation and preservation of all the institution which
    are best adapted to that support the people therefore may be safely trusted in
    a nation governed badly governed not according to  the natural and essential order
    but according to what the economist called the  political order it is always they
    said  one part of the nation which governs the rest the weaker which governs the
    stronger in this case too the power of him who command consists in nothing but
    the power united of those who obey him and this union of their force supposes
    of necessity the union of their will which can be founded only upon the persuasion
    that this obedience procures them their best possible condition the power of the
    nation in this vicious order are le at the disposal of the sovereign than at the
    disposal of those who hire to him their agency and by consequence sell to him
    the mean of procuring obedience from the nation his situation is therefore at
    bottom a real dependence his situation is precarious uncertain changeable he is
    put in chain which he dare not attempt to break in every situation therefore it
    is the will of the people either of the whole of the people united or of a part
    of the people united against the rest which is in reality both the legislative
    and the executive power estimate therem i s t fore a high a you please exaggerate
    to any excess economist the inconvenience of being governed by the people you
    have that inconvenience still you are bound to it by the inexorable law of nature
    it is not within the range of possibility that you should escape from it we have
    already seen that the economist declare that  every man wish to have all the right
    on his own side all the duty on the side of other men  that every man like inequality
    in short when the inequality is in his own power from this they infer that the
    community cannot safely govern  but from this it may with much more justness be
    retorted upon them that nothing else can safely govern the interest of the community
    say the economist is easily known  the evidence of it is within the reach of all
    description of the people and so cogent a to be irresistible the union of will
    according to their doctrine follows a a matter of course here therefore it should
    seem w e have a much better security than can be found in the interest of any
    individual sovereign or subordinate it is remarkable enough that the economist
    have wholly overlooked in their criticism on the pians opposed to their own the
    representative systen  and yet it is pretty evident that it is by mean ot the
    representative system that the grand problem of government must finall be resolved
    the speculation connected with this subject will however find a more fitting place
    under the article government for the exposition of the original error of this
    sect in political economy it is unnecessary to do any thing more than refer to
    the immortal work of dr adam smith a few year ago these error under something
    of a new form were revived in this country with a success which show how much
    the opinion of that great proportion of the community whose opinion are not formed
    upon evidence are liable to change by every fluctuation of circumstance from an
    opinion which had governed this nation for age that to it commerce alone it owed
    it being the richest nation upon earth our countryman under the momentary threat
    of circumstance which created an unreasonable fear of being deprived of commerce
    embraced with an avidity hardly conceivable before experience the doctrine of

    for politics in this work the science wa for the first time treated in it fullest
    extent and many of it fundamental principle placed beyond the reach of cavil and
    dispute in opposition to the french economist dr smith showed that labour is the
    only source of wealth and that the desire inherent in the breast of every individual
    to improve his fortune and rise in the world is the cause of it accumulation he
    next traced the mean by which the power of labour may be rendered most effective
    and showed that it is productive of wealth when employed in manufacture and commerce
    a well a when employed in the cultivation of the land having established these
    principle dr smith showed in opposition to the commonly received opinion of the
    merchant politician and statesman of his time that wealth did not consist in the
    abundance of gold and silver but in the abundance of the various necessary conveniencies
    and enjoyment of human life he showed that individual are always the best judge
    of what is for their own interest and tliat in prosecuting branch of industry
    advantageous to themselves they necessarily prosecute such a are advantageous
    to the public  from thence dr smith drew his grand inference that every regulation
    intended to force industry into particular channel or to determine the specie
    of commercial intercourse to be carried on between different part of the same
    country or between distant and independent country is impolitic and perniciousinjurious
    to the right of individualsand adverse to the progress of real opulence and lasting
    prosperity i he fact that trace of most of these principle and even that the distinct
    statement of many of those that are most important may be found in the work of
    previous writer doe not in the least detract from the real merit of dr smith in
    adopting the discovery of others he ha made them his own  he economy ha demonstrated

    reduced them into a consistent harmonious and magnificent system we do not mean
    to say that dr smith ha produced a perfect work undoubtedly there are error and
    those too of no slight importance in the wealth of nation the principle to which
    we have just referred and which form the basis of the work are unimpeachable  but
    dr smith ha not always reasoned correctly from them and he ha occasionally introduced
    others which a more careful observation and analysis ha shown to be illfounded
    but after every allowance ha been made for these defect enough still remains to
    justify u in considering dr smith a the real founder of the science if he ha not
    left u a perfect work he ha at all event left u one which contains a greater mass
    of useful and universally interesting truth than ha ever been given to the world
    by any other individual and he ha pointed out and smoothed the route by following
    which subsequent philosopher have been enabled to perfect much that he had left
    incomplete to rectify the mistake into which he had fallen and to make many new
    and important discpveries whether indeed we refer to the soundness of it leading
    doctrine to the liberality and universal applicability of it practical conclusion
    or to the powerful and beneficial influence it ha had on the progress and perfection
    of economical science and still more on the policy and destiny of nation dr fcimith

    which strictly belong to the one without referring more or le to the principle
    and conclusion of the other but in their leading feature they are sufficiently

    exist and will have che fa arrichire chi ha inlrapresa la fabbrica e chi vi simpiega

    observe that dr smith doe not say that in prosecuting such branch of industry
    a are most advantageous to themselves individual necessarily prosecute such a
    are at the same time most advantageous to the public his leaning to the system
    of the economistsa leaning perceptible in every part of his workmade him so far
    swerve from the principle of his own system a to admit that individual advantage
    wa not always a true test of the public advantageousness of different employment
    he considered agriculture though not the only productive employment the most productive
    of any he also considered the home trade a more productive than a direct foreign
    trade and the latter than the carrying trade we shall hereafter show that there

    it he is not a man thoroughly worthless whose vice not ni misfortune are the cause
    ot his distress to supply him with the mean and this is an exercise ot virtue
    in these acquaintance and friend which is highly useful and tends forcibly to
    the increase of the benevolent feeling in the mind both of those who make it and
    of those in favour of whom it is made it is urged a a hardship of great magnitude
    that a man after he ha been a long time a contributor to a club should lose the
    benefit of the whole for a delay in payment at a season of peculiar distress but
    a certain degree of indulgence is allowed a defaulter doe not forfeit till the
    first meeting which is a month after the quarterday besides it is veiy common
    to misrepresent the amount ot the loss in this case what a man really and truly
    loses is that which will be necessary to place him in the same situation but that
    is only a much a will be necessary to entitle him to the allowance of another
    club this may be nine or twelve month contribution suppose the rate of contribution
    is s amonth and s of entrymoney what a man loses by expulsion however much he
    may have paid is only s if indeed he is an old man past the age of admission into
    another club what he loses is much more serious it is the value of all the benefit
    which he would have been entitled to derive and in this case some modification
    of the rule of forfeituie w r ould be desirable it is however no fundamental objection
    because such a modification may be easily made lastly the number of those who
    suffer forfeiture from real necessity and not from their vice is small bearing
    a very insignificant propoition to the whole for a hardship to the very small
    number a great benefit to the very great number is not to be foregone ibis is
    the very principle on which bad government is distinguished from good   it is
    brought a a strong argument against benefit club that the meeting are held at
    publichouses from this it is inferred that the member are at these meeting very
    commonly seduced to drink and acquire increase or confirm habit of intemperance
    this appears to be an inference altogether unwarranted and contrary to the fact
    i he comber are in general under the necessity of holding their meeting at a publichouse
    because it is only at a publichouse where they can in general hire an apartment
    for the purpose the use of the apaitment is sometimes paid for by the money spent
    which is always a limited and always a very small sum threepence most commonly
    or a pint of porter for each  and sometimes the room is paid for not in this way
    but by the contribution ot a penny or other small sum from each  and intoxication
    at the time of meeting is punished with a fine it is affirmed by those who have
    most attended to the practical proceeding of these society that instead of being
    a source of intoxication they have been one of the grand cause of it decrease
    one decided advantage which the benefit club o c i e t i e s posse above the saving
    bank is that the money benefit paid to the club cannot be taken out first to gratify
    societi any unnecessary desire secondly to buy furniture for the sake of an early
    and hence in all probability a fruitful that is a deplorable marriage thirdly
    to satisfy the parish for a bastard which often would not have been gotten but
    for the reflection that if the worst came to the worst mean were had to get rid
    of it in a moral point of view the formation of the people into little combination
    and fraternity is of the greatest importance it concentrate the eye of all upon
    each individual and render good conduct a thing of infinitely more value to him
    a it render bad conduct for men detrimental it is this circumstance which the
    sage mind of dr adam smith load with such emphatic praise in the supposed case
    of the division of a country into so great a number of religious sect that each
    congregation might be regarded a differing from the rest in this manner without
    difficulty and without care is exeicised one of the most vigilant and effectual
    of all censorship the most salutary of all inspection w hen an ignorant or almost
    any man can say to himself my conduct is regarded by nobodyit is astonishing how
    easy it is for temptation to subdue him  when he must say to himself i cannot
    perform a disgraceful act without reading aversion and contempt in the eye of
    all my acquaintanceit is astonishing how much he is strengthened for resistance
    there is yet another thing of cardinal importance if it were possible for the
    superior to do everything for the inferior people and to leave them nothing to
    do or care about for themselves nothing w ould be more calamitous than the accomplishment
    of such an event the mass of the human specie would thence become what the people
    of paraguay became in the hand of the jesuit  most perfectly helpless and ready
    on the least derangement in the machinery which conduct them to fall into the
    deepest wretchedness and barbarity a that machinery would be liable to be deranged
    by the slightest accident it could not be preserved in order long and would then
    serve a an introduction a necessary and certain introduction to one of the most
    deplorable condition of human affair the case is altogether different where the
    power of suffering for themselves is generally spread throughout the community  where
    the people have resource  where every man is accustomed to combine for himself
    the mean of warding off evil and attaining good there the machine of society cannot
    be easily disordered and human happiness is placed on a much more secure foundation

    in considerable affluence on his estate at boghall not far from that city he wa
    of a family sufficiently respectable to enable his son at a subsequent period
    to prove himself to the satisfaction of the court of st petersburg a gentleman
    born a a younger brother that son wa originally intended for the church and went
    at an early age according to the custom of scotland in  to enter a a student of
    humanity in the university of glasgow so that he wa initiated almost in the rudiment
    of latin and greek literature under the able instruction of dr moore the well
    known professor of greek and he acquired such a knowledge of these language a
    served to constitute him a correct classical scholar through life he pursued his
    study with so much attention a to obtain the approbation of his teacher and the
    admiration of his contemporary who were delighted with the originality and ingenuity
    of his conversation though he did not himself reflect with perfect satisfaction
    upon the degree of application which he had exerted in his academical education
    he took a degree of master of art in  having studied mathematics under dr robert
    simson and moral philosophy under dr adam smith the example of so correct and
    rigid a follower of the ancient method of demonstration a dr simson must unquestionably
    have exercised considerable influence on his yet unformed taste in mathematics  but
    he seems to have had a natural preference either from the constitution ot his
    mind or from some previously acquired habit of thinking for the geometrical method  for
    we are informed that  he first attracted the regard of dr simson by owning his
    dislike of algebra and by returning a neat geometrical solution of a problem which
    had been given out to the class in an algebraical form  with this mode of solution
    the professor wa delighted though the pupil candidly acknowledged that it had
    been adopted only because he could not solve the problem in the manner required
    of the class  he had imbibed in the course of his study an insuperable aversion
    to the pursuit of his original object in the church  not certainly from any want
    of religious feeling or from a dislike to the kind of life that wa intended for
    him but probably from some difficulty that had occurred to him respecting particular
    point of doctrine or of practice wa therefore compelled to provide himself with
    some other occupation and he readily accepted the offer of some of his friend
    in  to recommend him to dr blair a prebendary of westminster who had formed a
    scheme for sending prince edward the young duke of york to complete his professional
    education at sea in company with a son of admiral knowles and mr robison wa to
    have instructed his royal highness in mathematics and navigation he wa much disappointed
    on his arrival in london to find that the expedition had never been serious y
    intended and he readily accepted an engagement to attend young knowles a a private
    tutor when he went a a midshipman on board of the neptune   gun with admiral saunders
    who had the command of a force intended to cooperate wit  eneral wolfe in the
    reduction of quebec and r o b  upon the appointment of his friend a a lieutekobl

    that ship the fleet arrived on the coast of america in april  in may they got
    up the river and mr robison wa one of a party of  seaman draughted from the royal
    william into the admiral ship under the command of lieutenant knowles in this
    capacity he had an opportunity of seeing considerable service and of making some
    survey of the river and of the neighbouring country an employment for which he
    wa perfectly qualified both a a geometrician and a a draughtsman he also remarked
    the effect of the aurora borealis on the compass which had been noticed by mairan
    and wargentin some year before but which wa then not commonly known after the
    battle which wa signalised by the victory and death of the gallant wolfe the royal
    william sailed with his body to europe and arrived at spithead in november the
    next year she wa sent to cruise off cape finisterre but in six month she wa obliged
    to return home from having the greater part of the men disabled by the scurvy
    he used to consider the two year that he spent on board of the royal william a
    the happiest of his life and no inconsiderable part of his gratification wa derived
    from the study of seamanship a he saw it practised under the auspex of captain
    hugh pigot he did not however acquire any firm attachment to the mode of life
    which he had temporarily adapted he wa rather disposed to resume his academical
    pursuit and he had overcome his earlier objection to the ecclesiastical profession
    he could not however refuse the friendly invitation of admiral knowles to come
    and live with him in the country and to assist him in some important experiment
    which he wa making upon mechanical and nautical subject in the month of february  lieutenant
    knowles wa appointed to the peregrine sloop of  gun and mr robison accompanied
    him with the hope of becoming a purser he visited lisbon and several other part
    of portugal but he found a cruise in a small ship much le convenient and agreeable
    than in a large one and fortunately for himself and for mankind he finally quitted
    the peregrine and the naval service in june and returned to live with admiral

  text: 'e c o n  m i s t s economist fulness of happiness hitherto altogether unknown
    at this point therefore we may close the historical part of this article for the
    success of the great work of dr adam smith in a short time superseded the political
    economy of the sect and after the political economy wa discredited the rest of
    their doctrine met with little regard the memory of them however is well worthy
    of being preserved  and this task we shall now in a few word a possible endeavour
    to perform ii the economist proceeded upon no utopian plan which supposes society
    to be composed of being different from those with whom we are already acquainted
    they took man a he isa being having want and governed by the desire of avoiding
    pain and obtaining pleasure man must have subsistence upon this ground they first
    took their stand this being allowed it jfollowed of course that whatever wa the
    best mean of obtaining subsistence would command the operation of men a soon a
    ever it wa sufficiently known of these mean the first and fundamental is the establishment
    of property this they proved by convincing argument we cannot exist without consuming
    the nature of roan lead to a rapid multiplication of human being and the earth
    yield a spontaneous nourishment for only a few to make food keep pace with population
    labour must be employed upon the ground men would be born for no other purpose
    than that of destroying one another if there were not mean of increasing the quantity
    of food in proportion to those that were born labour then is one of the physical
    necessity of nature but if labour be necessary so is property because without
    property there can be no labour the proof of this proposition is short and irresistible
    nobody would labour under an assurance that he would derive no advantage from
    his labour nobody would labour without a certain probability that he should enjoy
    the fruit of his labour now this is property the only question then which remains
    is what is the degree of assurance with respect to the fruit of a man labour  in
    other word what are the law of property which tend most to secure the benefit
    which human being derive from their labour  this said the economist is the object
    and the end of our research they proceeded in their inquiry by the following step
    a a mean to this labour on which every thing depends a man must be free to use
    his natural faculty of labourhis muscular power this freedom they called the property
    of his person a another mean to the same end he must be free to use exclusively
    and to preserve what he acquires by his labour this they called his moveable property
    here we see the origin of that to which men have assigned the name of right and
    duty the exclusive power assigned to the man over his person and oyer the fruit
    of his labour are called his right lo allow these exclusive power by abstaining
    from every act which would impair them is called the duty of all other men here
    we see also that right and duty are reciprocal that they imply one aneconomists
    other that they are created together  and that the one cannot exist without the
    other destroy the right of property in the man you destroy by the same act the
    duty of other men to exclude themselves from what wa called his property destroy
    in the same manner the duty of other men to exclude themselves from what wa called
    his property and you destroy at the same time his right to that exclusion right
    and duty ar e in fact but different name given to the same thing according a it
    is regarded under one or another of two point of view another important concatenation
    is here also to be seen right are advantage  thing to be en joyed duty are burthen
    abstracted from thing to be enjoyed why should men accept these burthen submit
    to these duty  why  but because they find their advantage in doing so it is plain
    how they find their advantage in doing so and there is there can be no other reason
    men submit to the duty of respecting other men right that they may have right
    themselves it is good for them to have right  there can be no right without duty
    it is better to have the right submitting to the duty than by renouncing the duty
    to have no right the duty are then the price which is paid for the right the duty
    which one man yield to other men are the price which he pay for having right of
    his own duty then are in themselves evil  and they never ought to exist except
    when they are compensated by a greater good nobody ought to be subjected to a
    burthen which is not either to himself or to the community in which he ha clubbed
    his private interest attended with a good sufficiently great to overbalance the
    evil which he is made to endure utility then is the exclusive foundation of duty
    having laid this foundation the economist proceed on the necessity of subsistence
    rest the necessity of property and on the necessity of property rest the necessity
    of a certain inequality in the condition of men this inequality exists because
    a good is obtained through it which can in no other way be obtained  and that
    good the parent of every thing else to which the name of good is applied f those
    who complain of it say mercier de la riviere one of the chief expositor of the
    doctrine of the sect  see not that it is a link in the chain by which the human
    specie must drag from the abyss of nonproduction every thing which they enjoy
    a soon a i have acquired the exclusive property of a thing another man cannot
    have the property of it at the same time the law of property is the same for all
    men  each man however acquires in proportion to his faculty of acquiring but the
    measure of these is different in different men and besides this fundamental law
    there is in the whirlpool of accident a continual succession of combination some
    more some le fortunate which increase the cause ol that inequality of acquisition
    without which the motif to acquisition cannot exist   admit however he in conclusion

    the people depend upon what is called a balance a the whole of their security
    for good government they have no security at all such is the analysis which the
    economist present of the cause of good and evil in human society and of that order
    of thing which best insures the presence of the one and the absence of the other
    that part of their doctrine which alone is yet known to the mere english reader
    their political economy is introduced a only an auxiliary exposition it is part
    of the developement by which they endeavoured to prove the identity which they
    supposed between the interest of the sovereign and the interest of the people
    but a a very distinct account of this part of their system ha been given by dr
    adam smith and ha been repeated in a variety of publication  and a our object
    rather wa the exhibition oi those doctrine of the sect which nobody ha yet presented
    to our countryman in their own language we shall content ourselves with only marking
    the place which their political economy held in their general system a the society
    ha public expences it is necessary that it also have a public revenue to reconcile
    the formation of a public revenue with the idea of social order it ought to be
    formed if possible without infringing the property of individual for the sake
    of which the order of society itself is established it ought therefore if possible
    to be formed without diminishing the revenue of individual when the real origin
    of revenue the source from which it all is drawn is sufficiently understood the
    mode of forming a revenue for the sovereign without diminishing that of individual
    would be immediately apparent the source of all rich is the land because the land
    alone of all the source of production yield a produce greater than the cost of
    the production the surplus produce of the land therefore constitutes a fund which
    is over and above the remuneration to the agent of production and out of which
    the revenue of the sovereign may be taken without diminishing the motive to production
    that m i s t s is without retarding the natural progress of the economist state
    in wealth population and felicity to lay the foundation for this plan of a public
    revenue it wa necessary to prove that the land is the only source of production  and
    that manufacture and commerce though they alter the form of thing never add any
    thing to the amount or value of production in the developement of these view one
    of the most remarkable result at which the economist arrived wa the necessity
    of perfect freedom to all the proceeding which lead to production a giving to
    produce that form which is most agreeable to those w ho are to make use of it
    till the time of s the economist the necessity of holding those proceeding in
    chain and binding them to the will of government wa the universal doctrine of
    government and to a great degree of speculator themselves the general principle
    of the economist respecting the freedom of property necessary to constitute the
    foundation of social order led them to infer the evil of those abridgment of freedom  but
    they examined the inference in detail and showed that the meddling officiousness
    of government to compel industry to one thing and exclude it from another not
    only vailed to effect any good purpose but of necessity created obstruction of
    the greatest magnitude to production in general and tended powerfully to keep
    down the wealth papulation and prosperity of the state the light which they diffused
    on this subject and which soon produced a grand effect on the mind of men wa a
    good the magnitude of which is beyond calculation another of their conclusion
    is that the revenue of the sovereign taken a they said it ought to be wholly from
    the net produce of the land oughtto be a fixed and unalterable proportion of that
    produce the reason appeared to them conclusive if the proportion wa variable and
    depended upon the will of the owner of the land they might be induced to break
    upon the public revenue and deprive the state of those benefit which the public
    revenue is necessary to produce if it depended upon the sovereign the property
    of the land might be detached from that of it produce  no body would have a motive
    to become a proprietor in land and all the advantage which depend on the existence
    of that property would be lost the production of subsistence would fail and the
    community could not exist this proportion being once fixed there is no longer
    any contrariety between the interest of the sovereign and the interest of any
    portion of his people and the proprietor of land are a completely and securely
    exempt from contributing to the expence of the state a any other class of the
    community the sovereign derives no part of his revenue from the subject and this
    deplorable source of the conflict of interest is wholly cut off the proportion
    being settled for ever between the sovereign and the landowner that alone is the
    property of the landowner which is the proportion remaining to him the rest is
    with regard to him a if it did not exist the sovereign they denominated therefore
    coproprietor of the land and between him and the landowner commonly so called
    a perfect community of interest is fixed it is the interest of the sovereign that
    the produce of the land should in

    contending that the legislative and executive power must always be exercised by
    the same hand they affirm that those power could only be exexcised by those who
    had in their hand the superiority of the physical force observe now the legitimate
    conclusion the people alone have the physical force necessary to constitute them
    guardian of the law the same force is necessary for the maker and the executor
    of the law no body therefore but the people ever can accurately speaking have
    either the legislative or the executive powersin a state of ignorance they may
    be led by fraud to lend their power to their own destruction but it is a part
    also of the doctrine of the economist that in a state of knowledge in which they
    may be easily placed it is not possible they should make any but a good use of
    their power  a nation they said  governed according to the natural and essential
    order of society ha necessarily the perfect evidence and knowledge of it and therefore
    see with certainty that it enjoys it best possible situation this perception of
    necessity unites all the will and all the force in the nation for the support
    of that order and by consequence for the creation and preservation of all the
    institution which are best adapted to that support the people therefore may be
    safely trusted in a nation governed badl governed not according to  the natural
    and essential order but according to what the economist called the  political
    order it is always they said  one part of the nation which governs the rest the
    weaker which governs the stronger in this case too the power of him who command
    consists in nothing but the power united of those who obey him and this union
    of their force supposes of necessity the union of their will which can be founded
    only upon the persuasion that this obedience procures them their best possible
    condition the power of the nation in this vicious order are le at the disposal
    of the sovereign than at the disposal of those who hire to him their agency and
    by consequence sell to him the mean of procuring obedience from the nation his
    situation is therefore at bottom a real dependence his situation is precarious
    uncertain changeable he is put in chain which he dare not attempt to break in
    every situation therefore it is the will of the people either of the whole of
    the people united or of a part of the people united against the rest which is
    in reality both the legislative and the executive power estimate therefore a high
    a you please exaggerate to any excess economist the inconvenience of being governed
    by the people you have that inconvenience still you are bound to it by the inexorable
    law of nature  it is not within the range of possibility that you should escape
    from it we have already seen that the economist declare that  every man wish to
    have all the right on his own side all the duty on the side of other men that
    every man like inequality in short when the inequality is in his own power from
    this they infer that the community cannot safely govern  but from this it may
    with much more justness be retorted upon them that nothing else can safely govern
    the interest of the community say the economist is easily known  the evidence
    of it is within the reach of all description of the people and so cogent a to
    be irresistible the union of will according to their doctrine follows a a matter
    of course here therefore it should seem we have a much better security than can
    be found in the interest of any individual sovereign or subordinate it is remarkable
    enough that the economist have wholly overlooked in their criticism on the plan
    opposed to their own the representative system  and yet it is pretty evident that
    it is by mean of the representative system that the grand problem of government
    must finally be resolved the speculation connected with this subject will however
    find a more fitting place under the article government for the exposition of the
    original error of this sect in political economy it is unnecessary to do any thing
    more than refer to the immortal work of dr adam smith a few year ago these error
    under something of a new form were revived in this country with a success which
    show how much the opinion of that great proportion of the community whose opinion
    are not formed upon evidence are liable to change by every fluctuation of circumstance
    from an opinion which had governed this nation for age that to it commerce alone
    it owed it being the richest nation upon earth our countryman under the momentary
    threat of circumstance which created an unreasonable fear of being deprived of
    commerce embraced with an avidity hardly conceivable before experience the doctrine
    of mr spence that commerce wa no source of rich at all what the author of this

    at home under the domestic tuition of his father till the age of fourteen when
    he entered at the university of st andrew and wa almost immediately distinguished
    not merely for his singular proficiency in mathematical learning but for the extent
    of his general knowledge the clearness of his judgment and the dignity and propriety
    of his conduct a remarkable testimony to this effect ha been lately made public
    in an early letter of the late principal george hill who wa at this time one of
    his fellow student and wa himself so remarkable for early talent that we find
    it recorded of him that he had privately composed an excellent sermon in the tenth
    year of his am  a youth of this description cannot be supposed to have been very
    indulgent in his estimate of the merit of his competitor and it could therefore
    have been no ordinary measure of ability that called forth the following ingenuous
    avowal in a confidential letter to his mother   playfair ha very great merit and
    more knowledge and a better judgment than any of his class fellow i make no exception  my
    part might be more showy and the kind of reading to which my inclination led me
    wa calculated to enable me to make a better figure at st andrew but in judgment
    and understanding i wa greatly inferior to him dr cook life of principal hill
    it is scarcely a stronger though undoubtedly a very different proof of his rare
    attainment that when the professor of natural philosophy wilkie the once celebrated
    author of the epigoniad wa prevented by indisposition from delivering the regular
    lecture he used generally to delegate the task of instruction to his youthful
    pupil wilkie besides being a scholar and philosopher of no mean note wa a man
    of primitive benevolence and integrity and of great vivacity in conversation and
    the friendship which in spite of the disparity of their yea wa speedily formed
    between him and oung playfair speaks a much for the social and moral character
    of the latter a his substitution of him in the classroom doe for his early p l
    a proficiency in science on this last subject we piayir shall mention but one
    fact more in  whenv only eighteen year of age he offered himself with the approbation
    of his instructor at st andrew a candidate for the professorship of mathematics
    in mareschal college aberdeen and sustained with the most distinguished credit
    an examination or comparative trial which lasted eleven day and embraced nearly
    the whole range of the exact science out of the six competitor who entered the
    list against him two only were judged to have excelled himthe reverend dr trail
    who wa appointed to the office and dr hamilton who afterwards succeeded to and
    ha long filled it with much reputation in  he removed to edinburgh where his merit
    and modesty very soon introduced him to the friendship of dr robertsonadam smithdr

    the utmost cordiality during the whole period of their life in  he wa a candidate
    for the professorship of natural philosophy at st andrew vacant by the death of
    his friend dr wilkie there wa no comparative trial on this occasion and he wa
    again unsuccessful under circumstance which have led one of the most dutiful son
    of that university dr cook in in life of principal hill to remark  how much it
    suffered in thus losing a man by whose talent it reputation would have been so
    highly promoted in the course of the same year the death of his father suddenly
    devolved upon him the burden of supporting the family and admonished him no longer
    to delay the final election of a profession he had been educated with a view to
    the church and wa every way qualified to accept a living on the establishment
    but his decided predilection for science had hitherto made him hesitate about
    engaging in a vocation the duty of which he felt if conscientiously discharged
    would necessarily interfere to a great extent with the study he wa lotli to abandon
    in this emergency however he thought himself no longer entitled to indulge in
    those predilectionsand accordingly made appr cation to lord gray the patron for
    a presentation to the living of liff and benvie which had been filed by his father
    his lordship wa too well awaie of his merit to hesitate about conferring so great
    a benefit on the parishioner and immediately issued a presentation in his favour
    although from some challenge of his right to the patronage induction wa not obtained
    till late in the year  from this period till  mr playfair wa constantly resident
    at lifl and occupied almost exclusively with the pastoral duty of his office in
    this retreat his leisure hour were dedicated to the education of his younger brother
    and to a very close and intimate correspondence with mr robertson now lord robertson
    the son of the illustrious historian to whom he seems to have confided the remark
    that occurred to him upon the different author he perused and the subject of speculation
    which they suggested  we cannot help hoping that some selection from this correspondence

    study his work and are right in doing so a model of pure composition extremely
    deserving of attention during the present declining state of english style with

    montesquieu for politics in this work the science wa for the first time treated
    in it fullest extent and many of it fundamental principle placed beyond the reach
    of cavil and dispute in opposition to the french economist dr smith showed that
    labour is the only source of wealth and that the desire inherent in the breast
    of every individual to improve his fortune and rise in the world is the cause
    of it accumulation he next traced the mean by which the power of labour may be
    rendered most effective and showed that it is productive of wealth when employed
    in manufacture and commerce a well a when employed in the cultivation of the land
    having established these principle dr smith showed in opposition to the commonly
    received opinion of the merchant politician and statesman of his time that wealth
    did not consist in the abundance of gold and silver but in the abundance of the
    various necessary conveniencies and enjoyment of human life he showed that individual
    are always the best judge of what is for their own interest and that in prosecuting
    branch of industry advantageous to themselves they necessarily prosecute such
    a are advantageous to the public  from thence dr smith drew his grand inference
    that every regulation intended to force industry into particular chan nels or
    to determine the specie of commercial intercourse to be carried on between different
    part of the same country or between distant and independent country is impolitic
    and perniciousinjurious to the right of individualsand adverse to the progress
    of real opulence and lasting prosperity the fact that trace of most of these principle
    and even that the distinct statement of many of those that are most important
    may be found in the work of previous writer doe not in the least detract from
    the real merit of dr smith in adopting the discovery ot others he ha made them
    his own  he  ha demonstrated the truth of principle on which his wealth of predecessor
    had in most case stumbled by chance  nation ha disentangled and separated them
    from the error by which they were incumbered  ha traced their remote consequence
    and pointed out their limitation  ha shown their practical importance and real
    valuetheir mutual dependence and relation and ha reduced them into a consistent
    harmonious and magnificent system we do not mean to say that dr smith ha produced
    a perfect work undoubtedly there are error and those too of no slight importance
    in the wealth of nation the principle to which we have just referred and which
    form the basis of the work are unimpeachable  but dr smith ha not always reasoned
    correctly from them and he ha occasionally introduced others which a more careful
    observation and analysis ha shown to be illfounded but after every allowance ha
    been made for these defect enough still remains to justify u in considering dr
    smith a the real founder of the science if he ha not left u a perfect work he
    ha at all event left u one which contains a greater mass of useful and universally
    interesting truth than ha ever been given to the world by any other individual
    and he ha pointed out and smoothed the route by following which subsequent philosopher
    have been enabled to perfect much that he had left incomplete to rectify the mistake
    into which he had fallen and to make many new and important discovery whether
    indeed we refer to the soundness of it leading doctrine to the liberality and
    universal applicability of it practical conclusion or to the powerful and beneficial
    influence it ha had on the progress and perfection of economical science and still
    more on the policy and destiny of nation dr smith work must be placed in the foremost
    rank of those that have done most to liberalise enlighten and enrich mankind the
    practical part of the science of political ecodistinction nomy wa long confounded
    with that of politics and bete n it is undoubtedly true that they are very intimately
    pj  i and connected and that it is frequently impossible to economy treat those
    question vhich strictly belong to the one without referring more or le to the
    principle and conclusion of the other but in their leading feature they are sufficiently
    distinct the law which regulate the production and distribution of wealth are
    the same in every country and stage of society those circumstance which are favourable
    or unfavourable to the increase of rich and population in a republic may equally
    exist and will have che faarrichire chi ha intrapresa lafabbrica e chi vi simpiega
    con fehce talentomeditazioni sulla economic polilica    it is of importance to
    observe that dr smith doe not say that in prosecuting such branch of industry
    a are most advantageous to themselves individual necessarily prosecute such a
    are at the same time most advantageous to the public his leaning to the system
    of the economist a leaning perceptible in every part of his workmade him so far

    wa not always a true test of the public advantageousness of different employment

    especially if he is not a man thoroughly worthless whose vice not his misfortune
    are the cause of his distress to supply him with the mean and this is an exercise
    of virtue in these acquaintance and friend which is highly useful and tends forcibly
    to the increase of the benevolent feeling in the mind both of those who make it
    and of those in favour of whom it is made it is urged a a hardship of great magnitude
    that a man after he ha been a long time a contributor to a club should lose the
    benefit of the whole for a delay in payment at a season of peculiar distress but
    a certain degree of indulgence is allowed a defaulter doe not forfeit till the
    first meeting which is a month after the quarterday besides it is very common
    to misrepresent the amount of the loss in this case what a man really and truly
    loses is that which will be necessary to place him in the same situation but that
    is only a much a will be necessary to entitle him to the allowance of another
    club this may be nine or twelve month contribution suppose the rate of contribution
    is s amonth and s of entrymoney what a man loses by expulsion however much he
    may have paid is only s if indeed he is an old man past the age of admission into
    another club what he loses is much more serious it is the value of all the benefit
    which he would have been entitled to derive and in this case some modification
    of the rule of forfeiture would be desirable it is however no fundamental objection
    because such a modification may be easily made lastly the number of those who
    suffer forfeiture from real necessity and not from their vice is small bearing
    a very insignificant proportion to the whole for a hardship to the very small
    number a great benefit to the very great number is not to be foregone this is
    the very principle on which bad government is distinguished from good it is brought
    a a strong argument against benefit club that the meeting are held at publichouses
    from this it is inferred that the member are at these meeting very commonly seduced
    to drink and acquire increase or confirm habit of intemperance this appears to
    be an inference altogether unwarranted and contrary to the fact the member are
    in general under the necessity of holding their meeting at a publichouse because
    it is only at a publichouse where they can in general hire an apartment for the
    purpose the use of the apartment is sometimes paid for by the money spent which
    is always a limited and always a very small sum threepence most commonly or a
    pint of porter for each and sometimes the room is paid for not in this way but
    by the contribution of a penny or other small sum from each  and intoxication
    at the time of meeting is punished with a fine it is affirmed by those who have
    most attended to the practical proceeding of these society that instead of being
    a source of intoxication they have been one of the grand cause of it decrease
    one decided advantage which the benefit club posse above the saving bank is that
    the money benefit paid to the club cannot be taken out first to gratify society
    any unnecessary desire secondly to buy furniture for the sake of an early and
    hence in all probability a fruitful that is a deplorable marriage thirdly to satisfy

  text: 'economist economist fulness of happiness hitherto altogether unknown at this
    point therefore we may close the historical part of this article for the success
    of the great work of dr adam smith in a short time superseded the political economy
    of the sect and after the political economy wa discredited the rest of their doctrine
    met with little regard the memory of them however is well worthy of being preser
    ved and this task we shall now in a few word a possible endeavour to perform ii
    the economist proceeded upon no utopian plan which supposes society to be composed
    of being different from those with whom we are already acquainted they took man
    a he isa being having want and governed by the desire of avoiding pain and obtaining
    pleasure man must have subsistence upon this ground they first took their stand
    this being allowed it followed of course that whatever wa the best mean of obtaining
    subsistence would command the operation of men a soon a ever it wa sufficiently
    known of these mean the first and fundamental is the establishment of property
    this they proved by convincing argument we cannot exist without consuming the
    nature of man lead to a rapid multiplication of human being and the earth yield
    a spontaneous nourishment for only a few to make food keep pace with population
    labour must be employed upon the ground men would be born for no other purpose
    than that of destroying one another if there were not mean of increasing the quantity
    of food in proportion to those that were born labour then is one of the physical
    necessity of nature but if labour be necessary so is property because without
    property there can be no labour the proof of this proposition is short and irresistible
    nobody would labour under an assurance that he would derive no advantage from
    his labour nobody would labour without a certain probability that he should enjoy
    the fruit of his labour now this is property the only question then which remains
    is what is the degree of assurance with respect to the fruit of a man labour  in
    other word what are the law of property which tend most to secure the benefit
    which human being derive from their labour  this said the economist is the object
    and the end of our research they proceeded in their inquiry by the following step
    a a mean to this labour on which every thing depends a man must be free to use
    his natural faculty of labourhis muscular power this f reedom they called the
    property of his person a another mean to the same end he must be free to use exclusively
    and to preserve what he acquires by his labour ibis they called his moveable property   here
    we see the origin of that to which men have assigned the name of right and duty
    the exclusive power assigned to the man over his person and ovei the fruit of
    his labour are called his right io allow these exclusive power by abstaining from
    every act which would impair them is called the duty of all other men here we
    see also that right and duty are reciprocal that they imply one aneconomists other
    that they are created together and that the one cannot exist without the other
    destroy the right of property in the man you destroy by the same act the duty
    of other men to exclude themselves from what wa called his property destroy in
    the same manner the duty of other men to exclude themselves from what wa called
    his property and you destroy at the same time his right to that exclusion right
    and duty are in fact but different name given to the same thino according a it
    is regarded under one or another of two point of view another important concatenation
    is here also to be seen right are advantage  thing to be enjoyed duty are burthen
    abstracted from thing to be enjoyed why should men accept these burthen submit
    to these duty  why  but because they find their advantage in doing so it is plain
    how they find their advantage in doing so and there is there can be no other reason
    men submit to the duty of respecting other men right that they may have right
    themselves it is good for them to have right  there can be no right without duty
    it is better to have the right submitting to the duty than by renouncing the duty
    to have no right ihe duty are then the price which is paid for the right the duty
    which one man yield to other men are the price which he pay for having right of
    his own duty then are in themselves evil  and they never ought to exist except
    when they are compensated by a greater good nobody ought to be subjected to a
    burthen which is not either to himself or to the community in which he ha club
    bed his private interest attended with a good sufficiently great to overbalance
    the evil which he is made to endure utility then is the exclusive foundation of
    duty having laid this foundation the economist proceed on the necessity of subsistence
    rest the necessity of property and on the necessity of property rest the necessity
    of a certain inequality in the condition of men this inequality exists because
    a good is obtained through it which can in no other way be obtained  and that
    good the parent of every thing else to which the name of good is applied  f those
    who complain of it say mercier de la riviere one of the chief expositor of the
    doctrine of the sect  see not that it is a link in the chain by which the human
    specie must drag from the abyss of nonproduction every thing which they enjoy
    a soon a i have acquired the exclusive property of a tiling another man cannot
    have the property of it at the same time ihe jaw of property is the same for all
    men  each man however acquires in proportion to his faculty of acquiring  but
    the measure of these is different in different men and besides this fundamental
    law there is in the whirlpool of accident a continual succession of combination

    locke theory and to point out the real cause why it application to practice failed
    a it is generally acknowledged that it did  the greater portion of the silver
    recoinage having before the year  disappeared from the circulation by an abstract
    account of the price which the bank of england paid for gold and silver bullion
    in each year from  to  it appears that a early a  they paid l  per oz for standard
    gold and s d for standard silver  and it is probable that the same price existed
    at a more early date after the recoinage though the account state no price befoie  this
    account we conceive of very great importance and we think will satisfactorily
    explain why mr locke theory did not permanently produce the effect which the legislature
    expected from it by a reference to the price paid for gold by the bank of england
    from  to  it appears that the average price per oz wa l  s lid during this period
    the guinea wa current for s d at which rate the oz of gold wa coined into l  s
    d for if one guinea or  dwts ff g r s be worth s d  grs or  oz will be worth l  s
    fd it would appear then that the market price of gold wa only d above it mint
    price  and some debasement by wear may have existed upon the gold currency at
    this period causing such excess of the mint price while the mint therefore coined
    gold at the rate  of l s per oz and silver at s d the relative proportion wa a  to  there
    is only one quotation of silver given for the period in question and it is s d
    per oz if we take this a the average price for the seven year in question and
    we may be justified in doing so by the market price which follow in  and subsequent
    year a extracted from castaigns paper and laid before the house of common and
    ordered to be printed th march  at s per oz the average proportion of gold and
    silver in the market would be  to  but no individual would carry  ozs of silver
    to the mint to be coined into about l s d when these  of silver would procure
    an ounce of standard gold in the market which could be coined into l  s fd making
    thereby a profit of about l  s d per cent while this profit continued it may reasonably
    be inferred that gold and not silver would be the standard of our money it wa
    in september  that sir isaac newton delivered in his report to the lord of the
    treasury giving it a his opinion that gold wa considerably overrated in the mint
    with respect to silver and in consequence of this report the guinea wa by proclamation
    dated d december  declared current at s it is of importance to observe the effect
    produced upon the price of gold by this proclamation  and we are of opinion it
    will completely prove that the silver currency had not operated a the standard
    of value during the period in question when the guinea became a legal tender at
    s the price of gold became fixed at l s d joer oz at the mint for if  dwts f grs
    be worth s  grs or  oz will be worth l s lod this  fall in the price of gold from
    l s fd is coinage is lojd per oz and is equal to about l  per cent it appears
    by the abstract of price paid for bullion by the bank of england that in  and
    subsequent year they paid l isser oz for standard gold which is a fall from l
    s fd of is fd per oz and if an allowance is made for the debasement by wear existing
    at this period upon the gold coin the fall in the market price of gold will be
    equal to the reduction in the value of the guinea but this effect could not have
    been produced unless gold at the period in question had been the measure of value
    and a such the measure of it own price from these fact we think the conclusion
    may be justified that from  and probably a more early period after the recoinage
    to the date of sir i newton report the gold money of this country wa the standard
    measure of property  and that the reduction of the value of the guinea thereby
    making the relative proportion of gold and silver approximate nearer to those
    of the market wa the first step of which we have an authentic record taken by
    government to maintain the principle of mr locke theory and a the avoved intention
    of this report wa to give that rise in value to the silver coin which would protect
    it from thd melting pot and which could be done by lowering that of gold it may
    be inferred that the legislature w t ere aw are that the gold coin had attained
    the prerogative of being the standard of value at this time though the recommendation
    in sir i newton report wa carried into effect by making the guinea current at
    s yet it did not restore silver to it function a the standard of our money and
    this because the current value wa not made still lower sir i newton seemed aware
    of this himself and recommended that lod or d should be taken from the guinea
    instead of d this however wa not done and a the rate of s to the guinea the proportion
    of standard gold to standard silver at the mint wa a  to  the proportion of the
    market a we find by the price of gold and silver at this period in castaigns paper
    wa about d to   which constitutes a difference of about  per cent gold being still
    thus much rated above it value to silver  and consequently not only va no silver
    coined but the good and heavy coin were still melted for the high price they brought
    in the state of bullion it is surprising that the government having seen the operation
    of the principle recommended in the report of sir i newton did not carry it a
    little further and bring the current value of the guinea to a par with the market
    proportion of the two metal and so render it the interest of the public to carry
    silver to the mint to be coined before concluding our observation upon this highly
    interesting subject we must remark that the great mr locke himself did not impute
    the high price of silver after the recoinage to the cause to which we have here
    assigned it he attributed it to the permission of exporting silver bullion and
    to the prohibition of exporting silver coin this permission he said rendered the
    demand for silver bullion greater than the demand for silver coin dr adam smith

    the mother country may be of use to it that we may answer is a bargain not a tribute
    the mother country for example may yield a certain portion of defence but the
    colony is saved from the expence of providing for itself that defence which it
    receives from the mother country and make a good bargain if it get it from the
    mother country cheaper than it would be provided by itself in this case too the
    expence incurred by the mother country is apt to be a very full equivalent for
    the tribute received it is evident that this sort of bargain may subsist between
    any two state whose circumstance it may suit and is not confined to a mother and
    daughter country it is therefore no part of the question relating to colony hquiry
    a  we have now investigated the first of the o the admodes in which a colony considered
    a territory antages to me rely may be expected to benefit the mother ie got by
    trade country  and we which it affords lew of dr miths reasoning have seen the
    chance of good we shall now proceed to investigate the second  the trade by mean
    of which it is supposed that colony may benefit the mother country this is a topic
    of some importance  for it is on account of the trade that colony have remained
    an object of affection to englishman it is on account of trade solely that the
    colony in the west indie are valued it is indeed true that some idea of something
    like a tribute from the east indie ha till this time maintained a place in the
    mind of the unthinking part of the community but still it is the trade which ha
    been supposed to be the principal source of the advantage which ha been ascribed
    to what we call  the british empire in the east dr adam smith produce a long train
    of reasoning to prove that it never can be advantageous to a country to maintain
    colony merely for the sake of their trade in the idea of deriving a peculiar advantage
    from the trade of the colony is necessarily included the idea of monopoly if the
    trade of the colony were to be free other nation would derive a much advantage
    from it a the mother country  and the mdther country would derive a much advantage
    from it if the colony were not a colony dr smith affirms that this monopoly can
    never be of any advantage  must always on the contrary be a source of great disadvantage
    to the mother country he argues thusto make the monopoly advantageous to the mother
    country it must enable the mother country to buy cheaper or sell dearer in the
    colony than it would otherwise have done in ocher word it must enable the mother
    country to obtain the good of the colony for a smaller quantity of her own good
    than she could without the monopol this in the opinion of dr smith it doe not
    belong to the monopoly to accomplish the monopoly he say may enable the mother
    country to make other nation pay dearer for the good of the colony but it cannot
    enable her to buy them cheaper this he seems to take a a postulate without attempting
    much to support it by reasoning the extension of the market he say by which he
    must mean the vol iii part i competition of capital would in a state of freedom
    reduce the profit of stock in the colony to their lowest term under a monopoly
    he seems to think that profit of stock in the colony is apt to remain above that
    level and he assumes that the term on which the mother country deal with the colony
    must depend upon the rate of profit in the colony having on these ground assumed
    the impossibility of deriving any advantage from the monopoly of the colonial
    trade dr smith proceeds to represent a variety of disadvantage which he think
    it ha a necessary tendency to produce his argument is that the monopoly of the
    colonial trade necessarily raise the profit of stock in the mother country  and
    that  whatever to use his own expression  raise in any country the ordinary rate
    of profit higher than it otherwise would be necessarily subject that country both
    to an absolute and to a relative disadvantage in every branch of trade of wdiich
    she ha not the monopoly to prove the first of these proposition he say that by
    the monopoly of the trade of any colony foreign capital is driven from it the
    capital of the trade is thus made deficient the profit of the capital is for that
    reason increased the increase of profit in the colony draw capital from the mother
    country the departure of capital from the mother country make the portion of capital
    in the mother country deficient and hence raise in the mother country the profit
    of stock to prove the second of the proposition he say that high profit produce
    high price  and that high price diminish produce to afford her merchant the high
    profit in question the country must pay dearer for the good she import  and must
    sell dearer those which she export she must therefore he infers  both buy le and
    sell le must both enjoy le and produce le than she otherwise would do nor is this
    all other nation who do not subject themselves to this disadvantage to this diminution
    of produce may advance faster and thus attain a superiority which they would not
    otherwise have enjoyed and there is still a worse evil  by raising the price of
    her produce above what it would otherwise be it enables the merchant of other
    country to undersell her in foreign market and thereby to justle her out of almost
    all those branch of trade of which she ha not the monopoly to this reasoning dr
    smith anticipates an objection it may be affirmed that the colony trade is more
    advantageous than any other trade and though it may be true according to the reasoning
    of smith that the monopoly of the colony trade ha diminished the amount of trade
    which the mother countrywhich england for example ha been able to carry on in
    other channel england ha lost nothing because she ha exchanged a le profitable
    for a more profitable employment of her capital in answer to this objection dr
    smith endeavour to prove that the employment into which the capital of england
    is forced by the monopoly is le advantageous to the country than that into which
    it would have gone of it own accord a the foundation of his reasoning he assumes

    will be very generally interesting to my reader i shall give it a place together
    with some extract from the correspondence to which it gave rise in the note at
    the end of this dissertation every thing connected with the origin and composition
    of a work which ha had so powerful an influence on the direction which metaphysical
    pursuit have since taken both in scotland and in germany will be allowed to form

    any apology for choosing to communicate to the public rather in mr hume word than
    in my own   sir gilbert elliot bart grandfather of the present earl of minto the
    original of the letter to which  refer are in lord mintos possession  a foreign
    writer of great name m frederick schlegel seems to think that the influence of

    extensive than i had conceived it to be his opinion on this point i transcribe
    a a sort of literary curiosity  since the time of hume nothing more ha been attempted
    in england than to erect all sort of bulwark against the practical influence of
    his destructive scepticism and to maintain by various substitute and aid the pile
    of moral principle uncorrupted and entire not only with adam smith but with all
    their late philosopher national welfare is the ruling and central principle of
    thoughta principle excellent and praiseworthy in it due situation but quite unfitted
    for beino the centre and oracle of all knowledge and science from the connection
    in which this last sentence stand with the context would not one imagine that
    the writer conceived the wealth of nation to be a new moral or metaphysical system
    devised by mr smith for the purpose of counteracting mr hume scepticism  i have
    read this translation of mr schlegels lecture with much curiosity and interest
    and flatter myself that we shall soon have english version of the work of kant
    and of other german author from the pen of their english disciple little more
    i am fully persuaded is necessary in this country to bring down the philosophy
    of germany to it proper level in treating of literary and historical subject mr
    schlegel seems to be more in his element than when he venture to pronounce on
    philosophical question but even in case of the former description some of his
    dashing judgment on english writer can be accounted for only by haste caprice
    or prejudice  the english themselves we are told are now pretty well convinced
    that robertson is a careless superficial and blundering historian although they
    study his work and are right in doing so a model of pure composition extremely
    deserving of attention during the present declining state of english style with
    all the abundance of his italian elegance what is the overloaded and affected
    roscoe when compared with gibbon  coxe although master of a good and classical
    style resembles robertson in no respect so much a in the superficialness of his
    research and the statesman fox ha nothing in common with hume but the bigotry
    of his party zeal such criticism may perhaps be applauded by a german auditory

  text: 'econo m i s t s economist fulness of happiness hitherto altogether unknown
    at this point therefore we may close the historical part of this article for the
    success of the great work of dr adam smith in a short time superseded the political
    economy of the sect and after the political economy wa discredited the rest of
    their doctrine met with little regard the memory of them however is well worthy
    of being preserved  and this task we shall now in a few word a possible endeavour
    to perform ii the economist proceeded upon no utopian plan which supposes society
    to be composed of being different from those with whom we are already acquainted
    they took man a he isa being having want and governed by the desire of avoiding
    pain and obtaining pleasure man must have subsistence upon this ground they tirst
    took their stand this being allowed it followed of course that whatever wa the
    best mean of obtaining subsistence would command the operation of men a soon a
    ever it wa sufficiently known of these mean thefirst and fundamental is the establishment
    of property this they proved by convincing argument we cannot exist without consuming
    the nature of man lead to a rapid multiplication of human being and the earth
    yield a spontaneous nourishment for only a few to make food keep pace with population
    labour must be employed upon the ground men would be born for no other purpose
    than that of destroying one another if there were not mean of increasing the quantity
    of food in proportion to those that were born labour then is one of the physical
    necessity of nature but if labour be necessary so is property because without
    property there can be no labour the proof of this proposition is short and irresistible
    nobody would labour under an assurance that he would derive no advantage from
    his labour nobody would labour without a certain probability that he should enjo
    the fruit of his labour now this is property the only question then which remains
    is what is the degree of assurance with respect to the fruit of a man labour  in
    other word what are the law of property which tend most to secure the benefit
    which human being derive from their labour  tin said the economist is the object
    and the end of our research they proceeded in their inquiry by the following step
    a a mean to this labour on which every thing depends a man must be free to use
    his natural faculty of labourhis muscular power this freedom they called the property
    of his person a another mean to the same end he must be free to use exclusively
    and to preserve what he acquires by his labour  his they called his moveable property
    here we see the origin of that to which men have assigned the name of right and
    duty the exclusive power assigned to the man over his person and over the fruit
    of his labour are called his right to allow these exclusive power by abstaining
    from every act which would impair them is called the duty of all other men here
    we see also that right and duty are reciprocal that they imply one aneconomists
    other that they are created together  and that the v one cannot exist without
    the other destroy the right of property in the man you destroy by the same act
    the duty of other men to exclude themselves from what wa called his property destroy
    in the same manner the duty of other men to exclude themselves from what wa called
    his propei ty and you destroy at the same time his right to that exclusion right
    and duty are in fact but different name given to the same thing according a it
    is regarded under one or another of two point of view another important concatenation
    is here also to be seen right are advantage  thing to be enjoyed duty are burthen
    abstracted from thing to be enjoyed why should men accept these burthen submit
    to these duty  why  but because they find their advantage in doing so it is plain
    how they find their advantage in doing so and there is there can be no other reason
    men submit to the duty of respecting other men right that they may have right
    themselves it is good for them to have right  there can be no right without duty
    it is better to have the right submitting to the duty than by renouncing the duty
    to have no right ihe duty are then the price which is paid for the right the duty
    which one man yield to other men aie the price which he pay for having right of
    his ow r n duty then are in themselves evil  and they never ought to exist except
    when they are compensated by a greater good nobody ought to be subjected to a
    burthen which is not either to himself  to the community in which he ha clubbed
    his private interest attended with a good sufficiently great to overbalance the
    evil which he is made to endure utility then is the exclusive foundation of duty
    having laid this foundation the economist proceed on the necessity of subsistence
    rest the necessity of property and on the necessity of property rest the necessity
    of a certain inequality in the condition of men i his inequality exists because
    a good is obtained through it which can in no other way be obtained  and that
    good the parent of every thing else to which the name of good is applied f those
    who complain of it say mercier de la riviere one of the chief expositor of the
    doctrine of the sect  see not that it is a link in the chain by which the human
    specie must drag from the abyss of nonproduction every thing which they enjoy
    a soon a i have acquired the exclusive property of a thing another man cannot
    have the property of it at the same time  he law of property is the same for all
    men  each man however acquires in proportion to his faculty of acquiring  but
    the measure of these is different in different men and besides this fundamental
    law there is in the whirlpool of accident a continual succession of combination
    some moie some le fortunate which increase the cause of that inequality of acquisition
    without which the motif to acquisition cannot exist  l admit however he in conclusion

    of the balance to this extent may be a loss engrossing the whole of the protection
    to the common interest which it wa expected to yield  or it may be a loss not
    extending so far if it go to the whole extent of that protection there is to the
    purpose in question no balance at all if it doe not go to the whole extent there
    will still be some balance more or le what then is the case  the case is that
    the loss go to the whole and that the balance doe not exist the balance doe not
    exist a far a the private interest of those who share among them the governing
    power are concerned but it is only from the private interest of those who govern
    that the nation ha any thing to fear it is only against these interest that the
    balance is provided a far however a these private interest are concerned the balance
    doe not exist a far therefore a the balance is even supposed to be of any service
    the balance is excluded by the law of nature it follows a a corollary that in
    a country where the people depend upon what is called a balance a the whole of
    their security for good government they have no security at all such is the analysis
    which the economist present of the cause of good and evil in human society and
    of that order of thing which best insures the presence of the one and the absence
    of the other tat part of their doctrine which alone is yet known to the mere english
    reader their political economy is introduced a only an auxiliary exposition it
    is part of the developement by which they endeavoured to prove the identity which
    they supposed between the interest of the sovereign and the interest of the people
    but a a very distinct account of this part of their system ha been given by dr
    adam smith and ha been repeated in a variety of publication  and a our object
    rather wa the exhibition of those doctrine of the sect which nobody ha yet presented
    to our countryman in their own language we shall content ourselves with only marking
    the place which their political economy held in their general system a the society
    ha public expences it is necessary that it also have a public revenue to reconcile
    the formation of a public revenue with the idea of social order it ought to be
    formed if possible without infringing the property of individual for the sake
    of which the order of society itself is established it ought therefore if possible
    to be formed without diminishing the revenue of individual when the real origin
    of revenue the source from which it all is drawn is sufficiently understood the
    mode of forming a revenue for the sovereign without diminishing that of individual
    would be immediately apparent the source of all rich is the land  because the
    land alone of all the source of production yield a produce greater than the cost
    of the production the surplus produce of the land therefore constitutes a fund
    which is over and above the remuneration to the agent of production and out of
    which the revenue of the sovereign may be taken  without diminishing the motive
    to production that is without retarding the natural progress of the bcohomists
    state in wealth population and felicity to lay the foundation for this plan of
    a public revenue it wa necessary to prove that the land is the only source of
    production  and that manufacture and commerce though they alter the form of thing
    never add any thing to the amount or valu of production in the developement of
    these view one of the most remarkable result at which the economist arrived wa
    the necessity of perfect freedom to all the proceeding which lead to production
    a giving to produce that form which is most agreeable to those w ho are to make
    use of it till the time of the economist the necessity of holding those proceeding
    in chain and binding them to the will of government w r a the universal doctrine
    of government and to a great degree of speculator themselves the general principle
    of the economist respecting the freedom of property necessary to constitute the
    foundation of social order led them to infer the evil ot those abridgment of freedom  but
    they examined the inference in detail and showed that the meddling officiousness
    of government to compel industry to one thing and exclude it from another not
    only failed to effect any good purpose but of necessity created obstruction of
    the greatest magnitude to production in general and tended powerfully to keep
    down the wealth population and prosperity of the state the light which they diffused
    on this subject and which soon produced a grand effect on the mind of men wa a
    good the magnitude of which is beyond calculation another of their conclusion
    is that the revenue of the sovereign taken a they said it ought to be wholly from
    the net produce of the land ought to be a fixed and unalterable proportion of
    that produce the reason appeared to them conclusive if the proportion wa variable
    and depended upon the will of the owner of the land they might be induced to break
    upon the public revenue and deprive the state of those benefit which the public
    revenue is necessary to produce if it depended upon the sovereign the property
    of the land might be detached from that of it produce  no body would have a motive
    to become a proprietor in land and all the advantage which depend on the existence
    of that property would be lost the production of subsistence would fail and the
    community could not exist this proportion being once fixed there is no longer
    any contrariety between the interest of the sovereign and the interest of any
    portion of his people and the proprietor of land are a completely and securely
    exempt from contributing to the expence of the state a any other class of the
    community the sovereign derives no part of his revenue from the subject and this
    deplorable source of the conflict of interest is wholly cut off the proportion
    being settled for ever between the sovereign and the landowner that alone is the
    property of the landowner which is the proportion remaining to him the rest is
    with regard to him a if it did not exist the sovereign they denominated therefore
    co proprietor of the land and between him and the landowner commonly so called

  text: economist economist dian of it own law because there is in the nation no power
    comparable to that which result from the combination of it power again  in contending
    that the legislative and executive power must always be exercised by the same
    hand they affirm that those power could only be exercised by those who had in
    their hand the superiority of the physical force observe now the legitimate conclusion
    the people alone have the physical force necessary to constitute them guardian
    of the law the same force is necessary for the maker and the executor of the law
    no body therefore but the people ever can accurately speaking have either the
    legislative or the executive powersin a state of ignorance they may be led by
    fraud to lend their power to their own destruction but it is a part also of the
    doctrine of the economist that in a state of knowledge in which they may be easily
    placed it is not possible they should make any but a good use of their power  a
    nation they said  governed according to the natural and essential order of society
    ha necessarily the perfect evidence and knowledge of it and therefore see with
    certainty that it enjoys it best possible situation this perception of necessity
    unites all the will and all the force in the nation for the support of that order
    and by consequence for the creation and preservation of all the institution which
    are best adapted to that support the people therefore may be safely trusted in
    a nation governed badly governed not according to  the natural and essential order
    but according to what the economist called the  political order  it is always
    they said  one part of the nation which governs the rest the weaker which governs
    the stronger in this case too the power of him who command consists in nothing
    but the power united of those who obey him and this union of their force supposes
    of necessity the union of their will which can be founded only upon the persuasion
    that this obedience procures them their best possible condition the power of the
    nation in this vicious order are le at the disposal of the sovereign than at the
    disposal of those who hire to him their agency and by consequence sell to him
    the mean of procuring obedience from the nation his situation is therefore at
    bottom a real dependence his situation is precarious uncertain changeable he is
    put in chain which he dare not attempt to break in every situation therefore it
    is the will of the people either of the whole of the people united or of a part
    of the people united against the rest which is in reality both the legislative
    and the executive power estimate therefore a high a you please exaggerate to any
    excess economist the inconvenience of being governed by the people you have that
    inconvenience still you are bound to it by the inexorable law of nature  it is
    not within the range of possibility that you should escape from it we have already
    seen that the economist declare that  every man wish to have all the right on
    his own side all the duty on the side of other men  that every man like inequality
    in short when the inequality is in his own power from this they infer that the
    community cannot safey govern  but from this it may with much more justness be
    retorted upon them that nothing else can safely govern the interest of the community
    say the economist is easily known  the evidence of it is within the reach of all
    description of the people and so cogent a to be irresistible the union of will
    according to their doctrine follows a a matter of course here therefore it should
    seem we have a much better security than can be found in the interest of any individual
    sovereign or subordinate it is remarkable enough that the economist have wholly
    overlooked in their criticism on the plan opposed to their own the representative
    system  and yet it is pretty evident that it is by mean of the representative
    system that the grand problem of government must finally be resolved the speculation
    connected with this subject will however find a more fitting place under the article
    goverxment for the exposition of the original error of this sect in political
    economy it is unnecessary to do any thing more than refer to the immortal work
    of dr adam smith a few year ago these error under something of a new form were
    revived in this country with a success which show how much the opinion of that
    great proportion of the community whose opinion are not formed upon evidence are
    liable to change by every fluctuation of circumstance from an opinion which had
    governed this na rion for age that to it commerce alone it owed it being the richest
    nation upon earth our countryman under the momentary threat of circumstance which
    created an unreasonable fear of being deprived of commerce embraced with an avidity
    hardly conceivable before experience the doctrine of mr spence that commerce wa
    no source of rich at all what the author of this article thought necessary to
    be said in opposit ion to these doctrine at the time he presented in a tract entitled
    commerce defended in answer to mr spence  and an able exposure of the same error

    commonwealth while he wa proceeding in his research he wa solicited by philip
    earl of stanhope the editor of dr robert simsons posthumous work and the other
    guardian of charles earl of chesterfield to superintend the education of that

    part of his education and to repair the neglect omission and error which had unfortunately
    been committed in the former part of iu  the proposal had originally been made
    early in the year  and wa renewed in december soon after the commencement of the

    recently become vacant by the death of his relation mr russell he wa not able
    to prevail on the patron to accept of a substitute to complete the labour of that
    session but after obtaining leave of absence for the next session he joined his
    young charge at geneva in may  and at first entertained hope that his labour might
    prove beneficial the connection however wa not so agreeable a he expected and
    it terminated about twelve month afterwards in the mean time he had very nearly
    been deprived of his office in the university the towncouncil had at his desire
    appointed mr john bruce then assist ant and afterwards successor to mr stevenson

    of general putnam dated july  that the nomination of dr ferguson wa very agreeable
    to the more intelligent part of the american who not without reason were dissatisfied

    appointment nugatory  i am very sorry he writes that the parliament of great britain

    i am deprived of seeing your friend dr ferguson which give me great pain a i always
    have heard of his being a gentleman of the first character for learning good sense
    and humanity it is well known that the commissioner returned without accomplishing
    the object of their mission  but they had an opportunity of acquiring more useful
    information of the state and temper of the country than government had received
    in all the previous course of the contest while dr ferguson wa absent during the
    session   his place wa supplied by mr dugald stewart who about five year afterwards
    wa destined to succeed him in the chair of moral philosophy in the year  so he
    wa seized with an attack of apoplexy which though not violent wa sufficient to
    alarm his friend for his safety this formidable affection did not in the slightest
    degree impair the force of his understanding and so abstemious did he afterwards
    become a not only to secure himself against the recurrence of the disease but
    to enjoy almost uninterrupted health for more than thirty year a he could not
    now venture to lecture a formerly without the use of written note he therefore
    found it necessary to write out a course of instruction to be read during the
    remainder of his incumbency in his endeavour to recover the substance of his lectuiesj
    he availed himself of the note taken by intelligent young men who had studied
    under him different fergussessions and who thus might be expected to have preserved
    the various mode in which he had stated his doctrine and the different argument
    and illustration by which he had happened to supply in one session what might
    have been omittedin another but in the prospect of soon relinquishing his office
    it wa scarcely conceivable that the compilation which he thus executed could posse
    all the excellency which he wa capable of imparting to it more especially a he
    wa now busy in carrying his great historical work through the press this wa the
    history of the progress and termination of the roman republic in three volume

    and the boldness of it description but instructs and animates by profound and
    masterly delineation of character a well a by the philosophical precision wth
    which it trace the connection of event it is written in that tone of highminded
    enthusiasm which if it can only snatch from oblivion whatever is noble and generous
    in the record of human action regard the grace of style a object merely of secondary
    account and is chiefly studious of impressing the lesson  of wisdom which may
    be gathered from the survey of distant age the fatigue and anxiety of public teaching
    now became oppressive to his spirit and not altogether favourable to his health  and
    he therefore deemed it expedient to resign his office in  wheu he had com pleted
    his sixtyfirst year mr dugald stewart then professor of mathematics succeeded
    to his office and in order to entitle dr ferguson to retain his salary he wa conjoined
    in the professorship of mathematics with the late lamented mr playfair he now
    proceeded to revise the note of his lecture on ethic and politics with a view
    to publication and in  the work appeared under the title of principle of moral
    and political science though composed under disadvantageous circumstance and though
    it ha omitted many of the question which were treated in his elementary course

    happiness and public security the author to whose suggestion he wa most indebted

    almost entirely cut offfrom the use offish the only argument in favour of keeping
    back the fish and throwing them overboard is the frequent westerly wind which
    prevents the fishingvessels from proceeding to the market up the thames but that
    excuse is now done away by the numerous steamvessels which could easily tow up
    the fishingboats the supply a we have stated is inexhaustible and the mean are
    within our reach of availing ourselves to any extent of that supply  but the demand
    appears obviously to be neither so steady and certain nor so extensive a it might
    and ought to be  and hence the real cause of the failure of all the plan for extending
    the fishery when the catch wa abundant the fisherman had no home market to take
    the fish off their hand and a bad season impoverished the fund of those who had
    embarked on a larger scale for the foreign market the promoter dissatisfied withheld
    their contribution and the fisherman dispirited and without capital directed their
    industry into another channel and too frequently from their knowledge gained of
    the opposite coast and new connection formed there into a channel destructive
    to their moral and injurious to the revenue observation the encouragement given
    by the government in  thebounthe shape of bounty wa riot sufficient to counteract
    the evil that have been stated and appears to have contributed but little to the
    success of the fishery if a branch of trade once fairly established will not support
    itself without being bolstered up by bounty it never can be worth carrying on
    bounty should only be continued for a definite time arid decreased gradually those

    vessel it wa proved by a committee of the house of common in  that the herringfishery
    absolutely cost little short of l annually which on an average of ten year wa
    equal to l per cent on the value of all the fish that had been taken by the vessel
    on which it wa paid adam smith ha justly observed that a tonnage bounty proportioned
    to the burden of the ship and not to her diligence and success in the fishery
    is not the best stimulus to exertion  it wa an encouragement for fitting out ship
    to catch not the fish but the bounty or to induce rash adventurer to engage in
    concern which they do not understand and cause them to lose by their ignorance
    more than is gained by the liberality of government the carelessness of such person
    and the ignorance of those employed by them in curing and packing the fish not
    only robbed the public purse but destroyed the character of the article in the
    foreign market where if saleable at all it fetched only an inferior price wdiile
    the skill and attention of the dutch secured for their fish that preference to
    which they were justly entitled the change of the bounty however from the tonnage
    to the quantity and the quality of the fish caught and cured with the regulation
    adopted by the act of fishery th and th geo ill   have had ihe good effect of

    a an ethical writer that he is known to the world and that he is entitled to a
    place among the philosopher of the eighteenth century  among the contemporary
    of dr hutcheson there wa one scottish metaphysician andrew baxter author of the
    inquiry into the nature of the human soul whose name it would be improper to pas
    over without some notice after the splendid eulogy bestowed on his work by warburton  he
    who would see the justest and precisest notion of god and the soul may read this
    book one of the most finished of the kind in my humble opinion that the present
    time greatly advanced in true philosophy have produced  to this unqualified praise
    i must confess i do not think baxters inquiry altogether entitled although i readily
    acknowledge that it display considerable ingenuity a well a learning some of the
    remark on berkeley argument against the existence of matter are acute and just
    and at the time when they were published had the merit of novelty one of his distinguishing
    doctrine is that the deity is the immediate agent in producing the phenomenon
    of the material world  but that in the moral world the case is differenta doctrine
    which whatever may be thought of it in other respect is undoubtedly a great improvement
    on that of malebranche which by representing god a the only agent in the universe
    wa not le inconsistent than the scheme of spinoza with the moral nature of man  the
    deity say baxter is not only at the head of nature but in every part of it a chain
    of material cause betwixt the deity and the effect produced and much more a series
    of them is such a supposition a would conceal the deity from the knowledge of
    mortal for ever we might search for matter above matter till we were lost in a
    labyrinth out of which no philosopher ever yet found his waythis way of bringing

    he observes that of all the paradox which i have had or shall hereafter have occasion
    to advance in the course of this treatise the present one is the most violentfreatise
    of human nature vol i p  it wa probably owing to this impression that he did not
    fully unfold in that work all the consequence which in his subsequent publication
    he deduced from the same paradox nor did he even apply it to invalidate the argument
    which infers the existence of an intelligent cause from the order of the universe
    there cannot however be a doubt that he wa aware at this period of his life of
    the conclusion to which it unavoidably lead and which are indeed too obvious to
    escape the notice of a far le acute inquirer in a private letter of mr hume to
    one of his most intimate friend  some light is thrown on the circumstance which
    first led his mind into this train of sceptical speculation a his narrative ha
    every appearance of the most perfect truth and candour and contains several passage
    which i doubt not will be very generally interesting to my reader i shall give
    it a place together with some extract from the correspondence to which it gave

    origin and composition of a work which ha had so powerful an influence on the

    of mr hume treatise of human nature on the philosophy of england ha been still
    more extensive than i had conceived it to be his opinion on this point i transcribe
    a a sort of literary curiosity   since the time of hume nothing more ha been attempted
    in england than to erect all sort of bulwark against tne practical influence of
    his destructive scepticism and to maintain by various substitute and aid the pile
    of moral pnnciple uncorrupted and entire not only with adam smith lut with all

    in which this last sentence stand with the context would not one imagine that

    devised by mr bmitii tor the purpose of counteracting mr hume scepticism    i
    i have read this translation of mr schlegels lecture with much curiosity and interest
    and flatter mysell that we snau soon have english version of the work of kant
    and of other german author from the pen of their english disciple little more
    i am fully persuaded is necessary in this country to bring down the philosophy
    of germany to it proper level in treating of literary and historical subject mr
    schlegel seems to be more in his element than when he venture to pronounce on
    philosophical question but even in case of the former description some of his
    dashing judgment on english writer can be accounted for only by haste caprice
    or prejudice  the english themselves we are told are no pretty well convinced

    probably alluded when he remarked that s by turning the soul inward on itself
    it force are concentered and are fitted for stronger and bolder flight of science
    and that in such pursuit whether we take or whether we lose the game the chase
    is certainly of service the name of locke of berkeley of hume of quesnai of turgot
    of morellet and above all of adam smith will at once illustrate the truth of these
    observation and show that in combining together in this dissertation the science
    of metaphysics of ethic and of politics i have not adopted an arrangement altogether
    capricious  in farther justification of this arrangement i might appeal to the
    popular prejudice so industriously fostered by many against these three branch
    of knowledge a ramification from one common and most pernicious root how often
    have mr smith reasoning in favour of the freedom of trade been ridiculed a metaphysical
    and visionary  nay but a few year have elapsed since this epithet accompanied
    with the still more opprobrious term of atheistical and democratical wa applied
    to the argument then urged against the morality and policy of the slavetrade and
    in general to every speculation in which any appeal wa made to the beneficent
    arrangement of nature or to the progressive improvement of the human race absurd
    a this language wa it could not for a moment have obtained any currency with the
    multitude had there not been an obvious connection between these liberal doctrine
    and the well known habit of logical thinking which so eminently distinguished
    their author and advocate whatever praise therefore may be due to the father of
    the modern science of political economy belongs at least in part according to
    the acknowledgment of their most decided adversary to those abstract study by
    which they were prepared for an analytical investigation of it first and fundamental
    principle other connection and affinity between political economy and the philosophy
    of the human mind will present themselves afterwards at present i purposely confine
    myself to that which is most obvious and indisputable the influence of metaphysical
    study may be also perceived in the philosophical spirit so largely infused into
    the best historical composition of the last century this spirit ha indeed been
    often perverted to pernicious purpose but who can doubt that on the whole both
    history and philosophy have gained infinitely by the alliance  how far a similar
    alliance ha been advantageous to our poetry may be more reasonably questioned
    but on the most unfavourable supposition it must be admitted that the number of
    poetical reader ha thereby been greatly increased and the pleasure of imagination
    proportionally communicated to a wider circle the same remark may be extended
    to the study of philosophical criticism if it ha not contributed to the encouragement
    of original genius in the fine art it ha been followed by a much more beneficial
    result in diffusing a relish for the beautiful and the elegant not to mention
    it influence in correcting and fixing the public taste by the precision and steadiness
    of the principle to which it appeal  another instance still more important of
    the practical influence of metaphysical science is the improvement wliich since
    the time of locke ha become general in the conduct of education  it furnishes
    no objection to these remark that some of our best treatise on question of political
    economy have proceeded from men who were stranger to metaphysical study it is
    enough for my purpose if it be granted that it wa by habit of metaphysical thinking
    that the mind of those author were formed by whom political economy wa first exalted
    to the dignity of a science to a great proportion even of the learned the rule
    of a sound logic are best taught by example  and when a precise and welldefined
    phraseology is once introduced the speculation of the most ordinary writer assume
    an appearance sometimes it must be owned a very fallacious one of depth and consistency
    fontenelle remark that a single great man is sufficient to accomplish a change
    in the taste of his age and that the perspicuity and method for which descartes
    wa indebted to his mathematical research were successfully copied by many of his
    contemporary who were ignorant of mathematics a similar observation will be found
    to apply with still greater force to the model of metaphysical analvsis and of
    logical discussion exhibited in the political work of hume arid of smith  s see

    proved the necessity of regarding the general good in every act of virtue an instance
    of that confusion of the theory of moral sentiment with the criterion of moral
    action against which the reader wa warned at the opening of this dissertation

    the controversy which followed the reformation yet it languished with every other

    of knowledge and virtue around him and should have rekindled in his adopted country
    a relish for the science which he cultivated  to him may also be ascribed that
    proneness to multiply ultimate and original principle in human nature which characterized
    the scottish school till the second extinction of a passion for metaphysical speculation

    the most important part of the legislation of all civilized state the work of
    grotius of locke and of montesquieu which bear a resemblance to it in character
    and had no inconsiderable analogy to it in the extent of their popular influence
    were productive only of a general amendment not so conspicuous in particular instance
    a discoverable after a time in the improved condition of human affair  the work
    of smith a it touched those matter which may he numbered and measured and weighed
    bore more visible and palpable fruit in a few year it began to alter law and treaty
    and ha made it way throughout the convulsion of revolution and conquest to a due
    ascendant over the mind of men with far le than the average obstruction of prejudice

    in a science more difficult because both ascending to more simple general principle
    and running down through more minute application though the success of smith ha
    been le complete his genius is not le conspicuous perhaps there is no ethical
    work since cicero office of which an abridgement enables the reader so inadequately
    to estimate the merit a the theory of moral sentiment this is not chiefly owing
    to the beauty of diction a in the case of cicero  but to the variety of explanation
    of life and manner which embellish the book often more than they illuminate the
    theory yet on the other hand it must be owned that for purely philosophical purpose
    few book more need abridgement for the most careful reader frequently loses sight
    of principle buried under illustration the naturally copious and flowing style
    of the author is generally redundant and the repetition of certain formulary of
    the system is in the later edition so frequent a to be wearisome and sometimes
    ludicrous perhaps smith and hobbes may be considered a forming the two extreme
    of good style in our philosophy the first of graceful fulness falling into flaccidity
    while the masterly concision of the second is oftener tainted by dictatorial dryness
    hume and berkeley though they are nearer the extreme of abundance  are probably
    the least distant from perfection that mankind are so constituted a to sympathize
    with each others feeling and to feel pleasure in the accordance of these feeling
    are the only fact required by dr smith and they certainly must be granted to him
    to adopt the feeling of another is to approve them when the sentiment of another
    are such a would be excited in u by the same object we approve them a morally
    proper to obtain this accord it becomes necessary for him who enjoys or suffers
    to lower his expression of feeling to the point to which the bystander can raise
    his fellowfeelings  on which are founded all the high virtue of selfdenial and
    selfcommand and it is equally necessary for the bystander to raise his sympathy

  text: leslie lc c could be urged to the young philosopher who unhesisirtin tatingly
    declared that he never would bestow half that  time upon any language and that
    he particularly disliked m latin in this state of his knowledge and taste he wa
    in his thirteenth year sent to the university of st andrew to study mathematics
    under professor vilant on examination by the professor he wa found already qualified
    for the second or senior class  and at the close of the session he obtained a
    prize it is remembered a a characteristic particular that having previously discovered
    in some of those antiquarian research to which also he wa early addicted that
    it wa not indispensable for student of the first year to wear a gown he steadily
    refused during this year to exhibit himself in the accustomed academical habiliment
    this session proved a decisive one a to the course of his future study the earl
    of kinnoull then chancellor of the university having been informed of his remarkable
    ability sent for his father and proposed to him to defray the expense of his son
    education provided the father would agree to maintain him at college with the
    view of qualifying him for the church the proposal wa readily embraced and the
    repugnance of theyouth toapply himself to latin wa at length overcome by making
    the permission to attend the natural philosophy class of next sessionthe great
    object of his desireconditional on his agreeing to qualify himself during the
    vacation for attending also the latin class with this lure before him he applied
    assiduously to his lesson under the direction of a private teacher and succeeded
    in fitting himself for admission into that class no one could discover in his
    after life any trace of this early and vehement dislike to latin  for though he
    ever held that the learned language were suffered to engross too much attention
    in our system of education and wa by no mean sparing of reprehension upon this
    subject  his own scholarship had become considerable  and indeed his writing manifest
    a more than ordinary degree of fondness for embellishing the conclusion of science
    with illustration from the greek and latin classic he continued to the last to
    read them occasionally particularly lucretius whose bold and imaginative philosophy
    and splendid description were peculiarly adapted to his taste he came also to
    be well versed in the theory of grammar and his observation upon language often
    evinced learning a well a ingenuity his health at the period above alluded to
    wa still so delicate that it became necessary to moderate and regulate his studious
    habit  but he succeeded during his second session in acquiring additional honour
    and in attracting in a more marked degree the flattering attention of the chancellor
    who kindly invited him to dupplin castle where notwithstanding the bashfulness
    of his manner he contrived to impress the other visitor with a high opinion of
    his power about the same time he became known to mr playfair on occasion of a
    visit which the latter alongst with the reverend dr small made to st andrew dr
    small son wa a fellowstudent and companion of young leslie and hence his introduction
    to both these mathematician mr playfair wa at this time parish minister of liff
    in forfarshire here he wa afterwards visited by his young acquaintance neither
    of them then dreaming of that lot which wa to place them in succession in two
    conspicuous chair of the university of edinburgh destined to derive from both
    additional lustre and  recommendation his visit to mr playfair were continuleslie
    ed after the latter in  resigned his clerical charge in sir joim order to superintend
    the education of the present robert v ferguson esq of raith and his brother sir
    ronald it wa in this way we believe that he first became known to these excellent
    and distinguished men then youth of his own age  and the acquaintance in after
    year ripened into a warm and lasting friendship alike honourable to both party
    and which formed one of the chief and most valued solace of his life in  or  he
    quitted st andrew and proceeded to edinburgh with the intention of entering himself
    a studentof divinity in the metropolitan university he wa accompanied by a fellowstudent
    destined like himself to obtain a distinguished niche in the temple of science
    james ivory and they lived together for some time he never had any liking for
    the church a a profession  and though he wa formally entered at the divinity hall
    he contrived to devote his first session to the science particularly to chemistry
    in fact he seems early to have relinquished all thought of the church a resolution
    perhaps hastened by the death of his patron the earl of kinnoull which took place
    soon after his removal to edinburgh he continued to study here till the close
    of the session of  and a is customary with student of greater ability and industry
    than mean devoted part of his time to private tuition one of the young men whose
    study he assisted wa nearly related to and became the heir of dr adam smith  a
    circumstance which he wa accustomed to recollect with pleasure a having made him
    known to that illustrious philosopher who treated him kindly and occasionally
    favoured him with direction a to his own pursuit his first essay a an author must
    have been composed about the time of h is leaving this university it wa a paper
    i the resolution of indeterminate problem which wa read to the royal society of
    edinburgh by mr playfair in  and published in their transaction in this year he
    wa prevailed upon by two young student of the name of randolph and of the distinguished
    american family of that name to accompany them in capacity of tutor to virginia
    and he accordingly left scotland alongst with them they arrived at the place of
    their destination in the beginning of november and his time afterwards seems to
    have passed both agreeably and usefully he wa all his life fond of visiting other
    country and pei hap a little disposed to underrate his own thus he wa wont to
    say that the thunderstorm of virginia took away all feeling of awe at those of
    scotland just a the alp of switzerland left him nothing to admire in the scottish
    mountain his stay in the new world did not much exceed a year owing to the breaking
    up of the family establishment by the death of the father of his young friend
    after visiting new york and philadelphia he returned to his native place towards
    the close of the year  from some letter to his family written about the time of
    his leaving america his thought seem to have been anxiously directed to his future
    mean of employment and support and one of his scheme appears to have been to try
    his fortune in india probably a a civil engineer this notion recurred afterwards

  text: l e s leslie adam smith then drawing near the close of his career it sir john
    wa on thig occasion if our recollection doe not mislead u that dr smith exhorted
    his young friend never to approach any author whose favour he might wish to win
    without first reading his book lest the conversation should happen to turn that
    way one of mr leslies object in visiting the capital wa to ascertain what success
    he might expect from a course of lecture on natural philosophy  and the information
    he received soon satisfied him a he say in a letter to one of his brother that  rational
    lecture would not succeed he therefore employed himself for some time in writing
    for the monthly review and in executing literary job delegated to him by his countryman
    dr william thomson author of the continuation of watson history of philip the
    third and of many other work now forgotten and who wa much in the habit of lending
    his versatile pen a well a his name to those who required the assistance or recommendation
    of either but a more eligible and suitable connection wa ere long opened to him
    by the invitation of the younger wedgewoods who had been his fellowstudents at
    edinburgh to reside with them and superintend their study he readily acceded to
    their proposal and proceeded in april  to their residence at etruria in staffordshire
    where he remained till the close of  in the enjoyment of a liberal salary and
    of society at once agreeable and intelligent this wa in every sense a happy and
    profitable period of his life the time not devoted to tuition wa assiduously employed
    in experimental investigation and in completing a translation of buffons natural
    history of hirds which he had previously undertaken for a london bookseller it
    wa published in  after he left etruria in nine volume octavo though executed with
    fidelity and vigour it wa valued by himself at least after he became otherwise
    eminent only a having by the sum which it procured him laid the foundation of
    that pecuniary competency which he early foresaw to be necessary to the independent
    prosecution of his favourite study  and which his industrious and prudent habit
    enabled him in no long time in a moderate degree to attain the preface however
    speaks of this  first attempt with some anxiety  and endeavour to bespeak lavour
    for it a executed  at an early period of life and in the retirement of the country
    this preface is written in that nervous but strained  and ornate style which characterises
    his after writing his first contribution to natural philosophy entitled observation
    on electrical theory wa also written at etruria and wa in  transmitted to the
    royal society of edinburgh for insertion in their transaction this wa promised
    but performance having a he thought been long and unhandsomely deferred he indignantly
    recalled his paper and laid it aside for many year it did not indeed see the light
    till  when he wa induced to publish it in the edinburgh philosophical journal
    conducted by his distinguished friend professor jameson about the period of the
    close of his agreeable engagement at etruria which wa occasioned we believe by
    the ill health of mr thomas wedgewood and the marriage of his younger brother
    a cornish gentleman with whom he had become acquainted at that place proposed
    to engage him a a companion in an extensive tour through greece egypt and the
    holy land ever fond a he wa of visitl i e ing foreign country particularly those
    hallowed by mehe morable event or classical association the proposal could  j
    not but prove agreeable to him and it wa accordingly emi braced with alacrity
    the tour wa to commence early in  but a change of plan having been decided upon
    without his concurrence and by which he found that his i observation were to be
    transferred to another he indignantly relinquished the engagement his intention
    to visit these interesting country when a fit opportunity should occur remained
    with him through life and at a period nearly forty year subsequent to thisin his
    last year indeedhe actually made some preparation for a year sojourn in egypt
    and palestine from which he wa diverted only by engagement and avocation of which
    he found it difficult to disencumber himself after leaving etruria he passed some
    month in holland  a country which like descartes he seems to have thought peculiarly
    suited to secluded study and where he at this time acquired the german language
    thereafter he returned to largo where he remained for about two year devoted to
    experimental research in the course of which he invented and perfected his differential
    thermometer the parent if we may so speak of that beautiful family of philosophical
    instrument  with which he enriched the treasury of science and amplified and variegated
    the mean of physical inquiry his ingenuity had been early exercised in some attempt
    to construct an accurate hygrometer and these ultimately suggested to him the
    wellknown contrivance above named a contrivance happily adapted to the measurement
    of the smallest variation of temperature and which richly rewarded his inventive
    power by it ministry to the achievement of his subsequent discovery it ha generally
    indeed been allowed to be one of the most useful a well a elegant invention that
    inductive genius ever applied to the investigation of chemical change at a later
    period when his name had attained a high degree of celebrity he like most of the
    other son of genius wa made to feel that fame brings with it pain a well a pleasure
    for it wa now discovered that the differential thermometer instead of being an
    invention of his own perfected a he ha himself recorded in the course of a series
    of experiment on the evaporation of ice which the severe winter of i afforded
    him an opportunity of performing  wa in reality a plagiarism if not from van helmont
    who died in  at any rate from john christopher sturmius who died some sixty year
    later such wa one attempt to impeach the originality of this eminently inventive
    experimentalist an instrument of which all the world remained ignorant till he
    by mean of it told the world the better part of all it yet knoyrs concerning the
    phenomenon of radiated heat wa discovered to have been furtively purloined from
    one or other of these worthy  neither the author nor the abettor of this allegation
    pretended that either van helmont or sturmius ever dreamt of such application
    or derived such result from their supposed invention a were reserved by some caprice
    of chance no doubt for it luckier plagiarist and it is now we believe allowed
    that this is just one of those case of curious but partial anticipation so frequently

    a many a sixteen or eighteen according a the situation of affair required augustus
    maintained a standing army of twentythree or twentyfive legion  but so large a
    number is seldom found in after time the different legion borrowed their name
    from the order in which they were raised thus legio prima secunda tertia but a
    there might be many primcc secundce tertice they were surnamed from the emperor
    a augusta claudiana galbiana flavia ulpia trajana antoniana  or from the province
    which had been conquered by their mean a parthica scgthica gallica leg arabica  or
    from the deity under whose protection the commander had particularly placed themselves
    a minervia apollinaris  or from the region where they were quartered a cretensis
    cyrenaica britannica  or from particular accident a adjutrix martia fulmivatrix
    rapax victrix each legion wa divided into ten cohort each cohort into ten company
    and each company into two century the chief commander of the legion wa called
    legatus or lieutenant the standard borne by the legion were various originally
    the standard wa a wolf in honour of romulus nurse  afterwards a hog which animal
    wa usually sacrificed at the conclusion of a treaty to indicate that war is undertaken
    with a view to peace  sometimes a minotaur to remind the general of his duty of
    secresy of which the labyrinth wa an emblem the figure of a horse and a boar were
    also borne  and marius we are told wa the first who exchanged all these for the
    eagle see army legislation the word legislation is used in two sens the one ancient
    the other comparatively modern in it ancient and most ordinary acceptation it
    comprehends the science of law a law ought to be explaining the principle from
    which law should be universally derived and also the rule to be observed in the
    application of those principle to particular country in it much more recent and
    restricted sense it is made to represent a much of the content of the municipal
    law of a country and a much only a is created immediately by the supreme authority
    acting in it legislative capacity in either case it is equally distinguished from
    the several meaning which have at different time been given by the majority of
    writer to the word jurisprudence for instance the science of legislation or what
    law ought to be is carefully separated by mr austin in his province of jurisprudence
    from the science of jurisprudence or the quality which are common to all lawswhat
    law therefore is and must be which it wa the characteristic object of mr austin
    lecture to interpret again legislation in both of the above sens whether used
    a meaning the science of perfect law or a descriptive of that portion of the body
    of any law which ha emanated from the legislature itselfis manifestly a very different
    subject from the jurisprudence prudentia juris of the roman in their written wisdom
    jurisprudence wa understood in it more primitive acceptation  in the meaning in
    short which with most person and for most purpose it still retains namely that
    of a general and scientific knowledge of the law whatever they may be there is
    a third and later meaning of jurisprudence in which it is narrowed down to the
    usage of the court this application of it is of french invention having been manufactured
    by them in technical opposition to an equally peculiar construction which they
    had put upon the word legislation this wa done with the view of distinguishing
    between the positive letter of the code termed  legislation franaise and judicial
    decision  which latter division of their law they consequently thought fit specially
    to characterize by the name of jurisprudence it is plain therefore that upon most
    occasion legislation and jurisprudence will mean different thing but on comparing
    legislation in the first and usual sense a above mentioned with the description
    of natural or universal jurisprudence a copied in a succeeding paragraph from
    adam smith it will appear that until we come to the modification introduced by
    particular legislation these two science are substantially the same man bv the
    very constitution of his nature is social and society supposes government investigation
    into the origin of government a for instance whether at it commencement it wa
    patriarchal or military are amongst the creditable amusement of conjectural philosophy
    but they are amusement only when compared with practical criticism on the form
    and the spirit of particular political institution or with the higher reasoning
    by which the true principle of a sound constitutional system are developed and
    determined all political institution are artificial construction admitting of
    great variety but they may be brought under one or other of two comprehensive
    class since in whatever hand the supreme authority of a state is lodged it must
    be founded either on the partial interest of certain individual more or le numerous
    or on the general interest of the whole community according to which of these
    class a government may happen to belong there will be considerable difference
    in the aspect and object of it legislation  but from the moment one or two are
    gathered together into a society their most pressing necessity is that of ascertaining
    or making the law upon which the social interest of it member are henceforward
    to depend the universal element of the science of legislation would seem to be
    sufficiently simple depending on the nature of thing and of man it may be thought
    there could be no mistake unfortunately the history of the human race ha not been
    so reasonable and so straightforward it wa late before the nature and condition
    of man either a an individual or a a member of society were analysed with the
    view of determining the choice between opposite mean of happiness or of ascertaining
    the rule of justice in process of time most of these question were settled more
    or le rudely by the respective society without much consultation amongst each
    other it wa still later before the thought occurred of forming into a general
    system the common principle which all nation might be expected to adopt barbarism
    and sophistry had had such long possession and had so confused and complicated
    the subject that to discover these common principle is the great and indeed arduous
    object of philosophical legislation looking at legislation with the help of philosophy
    and history it is evident that it uniformity ha always been and must always continue
    to be disturbed by two cause to a certain degree independent of each other these
    are the form of government and the state of civilization the contemporary tendency
    and character of law will vary

    i which ha been employed in their manufacture much  more will they vary with a
    in truth the substance of them is necessarily derived from the condition physical
    and moral the intelligence and the public virtue of each particular community
    the rule of municipal law are  in general intended say adam smith  to coincide
    with those of natural justice it doe not indeed always happen that they do so
    in every instance sometimes what is called the constitution of the state that
    is the interest of the government sometimes the interest of particular order of
    men who tyrannize the government warp the positive law of the country from what
    natural justice would prescribe in some country the rudeness and barbarism of
    the people hinder the natural sentiment of justice from arriving at that accuracy
    and precision which in more civilized nation they naturally attain to their law
    are like their manner gross and rude and undistinguishing in other country the
    unfortunate constitution of their court of judicature hinders any regular system
    of jurisprudence from ever establishing itself among them though the improved
    manner of the people may be such a would admit of the most accurate in no country
    do the decision of positive law coincide exactly in every case with the rule which
    the natural sense of justice would dictate the extent to which he conceived these
    aberration to have proceeded appears in another passage speaking of the civil
    and criminal law of particular country he observes  the principle upon which those
    rule either are or ought to be founded are the subject of a particular science
    of all science by far the most important but hitherto perhaps the least cultivated
    that of natural jurisprudence adam smith call the work of grotius not only the
    first but  a yet the most complete on this subject the legislative writing of
    mr bentham which have no necessary connection with his theory of moral will form
    an equal era robert hall observed of mr bentham that  in the particular province
    of his speculation the science of legislation he had advanced the limit of reason  and
    that if he were compelled to legislate for the world upon uninspired principle
    he should take bentham and go from state to state with a firm a step a though
    he walked upon a pavement of adamant had this eminent preacher given a much attention
    to law a to divinity he would have seen that some further deduction should be
    made from this unlimited panegyric there are striking warning scattered over mr
    bentham treatise upon legislation of the respect due to both the disturbing cause
    above mentioned but the general effect left both by the matter and manner of his
    writing upon most mind is on one important point that of domestic legislation
    inconsistent with the forbearance and caution which he otherwise inculcates for
    instance an ardent disciple impregnated with his principle might be induced to
    alter the law of his own country at once too suddenly and too far and when the
    alteration wa made to err equally in inferring that it wa made for ever yet mr
    bentham wa fully aw r are of the nature of the limitation and variation by which
    his general theory ought to be accommodated to practice an express dissertation
    on the influence of time and place on subject of legislation is set apart to the
    solution of the problem how the best law being given the legislator ought to modify
    them according to temporary and local consideration there is nothing to add to
    his observation and admission on the necessary effect of caame of place with reference
    to the propriety of transplanting law from one people to another he saw the difficulty
    of english lawmaking for india but a great deal we think is wanting in his sketch
    of the probable effect of change of time in legislapreventing the same law from
    being equally suited to tion distant generation of the same people he restricts
    this v v  effect to the constitutional code excluding almost entirely the civil
    and criminal code from it operation montesquieu spirit of law and the treatise
    on legislation by m comte are excellent repertory of the principal fact by which
    traveller have established the variety that exists amongst the family of the human
    specie scattered over the globe the difference between the extreme limit of our
    common nature to which difference all rational legislation will conform are indeed
    immense it wa in this point of view that burke received the lesson contained in
    dr robertson history of america and felt their application to all who have to
    take part in the government of man the british statesman ha acknowledged his obligation
    to the historian of the new world in language which those of his countryman who
    are bent on judging of all institution by their own standard and on assimilating
    all nation to themselves would do well to recollect  i have always thought that
    we posse at this time very great advantage towards the knowledge of human nature
    we need no longer go to history to trace it in all stage and period history from
    it comparative youth is but a poor instructor when the egyptian called the greek
    child in antiquity we may well call them child and so we may call all those nation
    which were able to trace the progress of society only within their own limit but
    now the great map of mankind is unrolled at once and there is no state or gradation
    of barbarism and no mode of refinement which we have not at the same moment under
    our view the very different civility of europe and of china the barbarism of persia
    and of abyssinia the erratic manner of tartary and of arabia the savage state
    of north america and of new zealand all this is very true and yet a given race
    may be no more a fixed quantity the proper subject of an identical legislation
    than the human specie itself the historian of the old world ha not owing to the
    effect of lapse of time his evidence a accessible a wa the case with the historian
    of the new in respect of a removal from one hemisphere to another it should be
    observed however that it happened in the instance of the native of america that
    both the cause were at work a to the extent of the change wrought by time in the
    condition and character of the same nation whilst dwelling on the same soil nobody
    can doubt and the legislator of successive period must notice and follow out these
    change upon principle precisely similar to the precaution by which transplanted
    legislation is controlled no greater suffering can be inflicted on a progressive
    people than by the attempt at constructing immutable law s on the supposition
    of this partial immutability of nature a system of uniformity and contraction
    which might fix for age a in a mould some strangely stationary race the jew the
    medes and persian or the chinese must have been torture to the greek even of sparta
    if the twelve table had been the perfection of appropriate legislation in the
    age of the decemvirs there can be no question but that justinian institute wa
    more in harmony with the contemporary of tribonian it is probable that the koran
    may not have been even from the first the best possible system for the follower
    of mahommed supposing it to have been so it is very certain that through every
    change of circumstance it could not remain the best for their descendant instead
    of stipulating like the locrians that the man who at any time proposed a new law
    should do so with a halter round his neck when locke undertook to legislate for
    carolina it wa on the understanding that his law were to be revised at the expiration

  text: 'legislation legislayears at the present moment in all those moral and sotion
    cial quality with which the law is concerned the hindu is not much more remote
    from the european than the actual generation of artificial englishman is separated
    from the anglosaxon horde whom nevertheless they represent in blood in language
    and in soil adam smith is for putting a more extended meaning than bentham and
    de tracy will allow on the celebrated saying of solon that he had given the athenian
    if not the best law the best that they could bear we should say indeed that we
    know of no such thing a an abstract best in positive legislation best for them
    is in their case best to ascertain mr bentham opinion however on this a on other
    subject the whole body of his writing must be taken together otherwise on looking
    at his personal ambition for becoming the legislator of almost every nation under
    heaven and at his hypothesis that no person wa likely to legislate for a country
    so well a a stranger it might be inferred that he wa disposed too hastily to pull
    down or to overleap the great partitionwall of national distinction in the same
    manner the prospect on the effect of time so narrow in the chapter alluded to
    is elsewhere enlarged until it embrace every distant contingency we could desire
    mr bentham is aware that a periodical revision of it provision will be a necessary
    supplement to a code he wa apparently unconscious of the property of accommodation
    which the admirer of the common law have discovered in it popular and malleable
    nature so in his first letter to mr madison in  after observing that the common
    law wa nothing but  an ideal and shapeless mass of merely conjectural and essentially
    uncognoscible matter he proceeds to complain of it a unfitted to our actual want   law
    which being in so far a it could be said to be made made at a multitude of successive
    period and for the use and governance of so many different generation of menmen
    imbued with notion habituated to mode of life differing more or le widely from
    each other a well a from those which have place at presentwould even had it been
    well adapted to the circumstance and exigency of the time in which it part came
    respectively into existence have to a considerable degree been thereby rendered
    not the better adapted but by so much the worse adapted to the notion and manner
    now prevalent to the state of thing at present m existence admission more extensive
    than these a to the vast alteration which the quiet hand of time passing over
    the body of the law and the character and condition of a people must necessarily
    produce severing them from each other wider and wider even modern english lawmaker
    who are never easy but when tinkering at an act of parliament could not possibly
    require the word law in it proper and original sense carry with it the notion
    of a superior this intimation of supremacy is the principal quality conveyed in
    the widest definition of law namely  the expression of a will by a command in
    this point of view the authoritative interposition of conscience enables moralist
    who adopt the theory of conscience to speak with perfect correctness of the law
    of moral in their mouth it is no metaphor what is the nature of the will or of
    the command which may be coupled with the law is an entirely distinct consideration
    a frequent source of misconception that of false analogy would have been avoided
    if writer had more carefully separated the several meaning in which the word law
    is used above all there are two meaning between which it is important to discriminate
    one in which the difference consists in the subject of the law the other in their
    author the first division is formed by the distinction between matter and the
    mixed human constitutionbetween lcmthe passiveness and uniformity of matter and
    the free tim jor agency and the consequent variableness of imperfect man hence
    originates the complete disseveration of those law of the material world which
    simply represent what is from the law of the moral world which represent what
    ought to be the law of the material world are physical phenomenon stated in a
    general proposition the occurrence of a single exception would disprove the law
    the law of ethic although really derived from and dependent upon human nature
    presuppose a moral assumption with which the fact are to coincide accordingly
    they will continue equally to be the law of our moral being even whilst they are
    violated every day the second division is formed by the distinction between a
    perfect and imperfect legislator  between the legislative attribute of god and
    the legislative attribute of man if montesquieu had observed the first of these
    division he probably would not have put i in apposition so many different sens
    of the word law a i are used in the following sentence nor have left his reader
    to infer that the same word on these several ocl casions meant always the same
    thing  the deity ha  his law  the material world it law intelligence superior
    t to man their law the brute their law man his law attention to the second division
    would have protected black stone from quoting the description given by cicero
    of the l i law of nature or moral a synonymous with that of posia tive or municipal
    law  speaking of municipal law he ha b made the fact of law or no law depend upon
    it nature  according to the latter member of his definition there a can be no
    such thing a a bad municipal law for he detl fine it to be  the rule of civil

  text: w a t t watt provement of estate  wa an able man and drew neatly an d accurately
    which wa not very common in those day he died in  at an early age leaving  a survey
    of the river clyde from glasgow to the point of toward which wa published by his
    brother several year afterwards james his younger brother of an active ingenious
    and enterprising mind became a merchant in greenock and wa for upwards of twenty
    year a member of the town council a magistrate and a zealous promoter of the improvement
    of the town by his wife agnes muirhead he had two son james the subject of the
    present article and john a youth of promising ability who wa lost at sea soon
    after he became of age misfortune in trade and the decay of the faculty of his
    mind occasioned his retirement from business some year before his death which
    happened in  in his eightyfourth year james watt his eldest son and only surviving
    child wa bora at greenock the th january  he received the rudiment of his education
    in the public school of his native town  but from the extreme delicacy of his
    constitution wa with difficulty enabled to attend the class and owed much of his
    acquirement to his studious habit at home little more is known of his early year
    than that from the first he manifested a partiality for mechanical contrivance
    and operation and frequently employed himself in that way the desire of improvement
    in an art then little practised in scotland induced him to go to london in his
    eighteenth year and there to place himself under the tuition of a mathematical
    instrument maker but he remained little more than a twelvemonth the infirm state
    of his health compelling his return to his paternal roof in that short period
    he appears to have made great proficiency and he continued after his return to
    scotland to perfect himself in this art both at home and on his visit to his mother
    relation at glasgow where it wa his wish to establish himself but some opposition
    being made by the corpoi ations who considered him a an intruder upon their privilege
    the professor of the university took him under their protection and accommodated
    him with an apartment and premise for carrying on his business within their precinct
    with the title and office of tnnthematical instrument maker to the university
    this took place in  when he wa twentyone year of age and it must be inferred that
    he had already given satisfactory proof of talent to the eminent men who then
    adorned that seat of learning of whom it is sufficient to mention the name of
    robert simson adam smith dr black and dr dick the professor of natural philosophy
    there mr watt applied sedulously to business and in the few interval which it
    concern and ill health allowed cultivated those various talent which distinguished
    him in after life and there a lasting friendship wa formed with the kindred mind
    of dr black and of mr afterwards dr robison then a student at the university and
    nearly of his own age he remained in the college until some time in the year  when
    he removed into the town previously to his marriage with his cousin miss miller
    which took place in the summer of the following year the steamengine had been
    a frequent subject of conversation between mr robison and himself and the former
    had suggested the possibility of it application to the moving of wheelcarriages
    about the year  or  mr watt had tried some experiment on the force of steam in
    a papins digester and had constructed and worked with strong steam a small model
    consisting of an inverted syringe the bottom of the rod of wdiich w a loaded with
    a weight alternately admitting the steam below the piston and letting it off to
    the atmosphere observing the imperfection of this construction he soon abandoned
    it but the attention necessary to be bestowed upon his business prevented his
    reconsidering it until the winter of daq wlior  tiroo rvlvtt  a dl l p r  dol
    when he wa employed by the professor of natural  v sophy to put in order a working
    model of a steam p n  upon newcomens construction when he had renas  and set it
    to work he found that the boiler though   in proportion to the cylinder wa barely
    able to sunn with steam for a few stroke per minute and that a v  quantity of
    injectionwater wa required though it uj lightly loaded by the pump attached to
    it  red that the cause lay in the little cylinder two i nc u diameter six inch
    stroke exposing a greater surface condense the steam than the cylinder of larger
    enein did in proportion to their respective content  by short  ening the column
    of water in the pump le steam and le injectionwater were required and the model
    worked at a proper speed thus the purpose for which it wa pm into his hand wa
    accomplished and with this mode of account ing for the defect and this result
    most artist would have been satisfied but the case wa different with mr watt he
    had now become aware of a great consumption of steam and his curiosity wa excited
    to a more accurate investigation of the cause in which he proceeded in a truly
    philosophical manner the cylinder of his small model being of brass he conceived
    that le steam would be condensed by substituting cylinder of some material which
    would transmit heat more slowly he made a larger model with a cylinder six inch
    diameter and one foot stroke of wood soaked in oil and baked to dryness he ascertained
    from experiment made with boiler of various construction that the evaporation
    of boiling water is neither in proportion to the evaporating surface nor to the
    quantity of water a had been supposed but to the heat that enters it and that
    the latter depended chiefly on the quantity of surface exposed to the action of
    the fire he likewise determined the weight of coal required for the evaporation
    of any given quantity of water being convinced that there existed a great error
    in the statement which had been previously given of the bulk of water when converted
    into steam he proceeded to examine that point by experiment and discovered that
    water converted into steam of the heat of boiling water wa expanded to  time it
    bulk or a a rule for ready calculation that a cubic inch of water produced a cubic
    foot of steam he constructed a boiler to be applied to his model which should
    show by inspection the quantity of water evaporated and consequently would enable
    him to calculate the quantity of steam used in every stroke of the engine this
    he now proved to be several time the full of the cylinder he also observed that
    all attempt to improve the vacuum by throwing in more injectionwater caused a
    disproportionate waste of steam  and it occurred to him that the cause of this
    wa the boiling of water in vacuo at very low heat recently determined by dr cullen
    to be under  consequently at greater heat the injectionwater wa converted into
    steam in the cylinder and resisted the descent of the piston he now perceived
    clearly that the great waste of steam proceeded from it being chilled and condensed
    by the coldness of the cylinder before it wa sufficiently heated to retain it
    in an elastic state and that to derive the greatest advantage the cylinder should
    always be kept a hot a the steam which entered it and that when the steam wa condensed
    it should be cooled down to  or lower in order to make the vacuum complete early
    in  the fortunate thought occurred to him of accomplishing this by condensing
    the steam in a separate vessel exhausted of air and kept cool by injection between
    which and the cylinder a communication wa to be opened every time steam wa to
    be condensed while the cylinder itself wa to be kept constantly hot no sooner
    had this occurred to him than the mean of effecting it presented themselves in
    rapid succession these o v to  icijivi in a great measure have already been described

  text: language  language a the knowledge of language constitutes a great part v  f
    erudition a their beauty and deformity furnish emgeliius of ppy ment t taste and
    a these depend much upon the language p m the different tongue we shall proceed
    to make a few remark upon the advantage and defect of some of those idiom of language
    with which w r e are best acquainted a the word idiom and genius of a language
    are often confounded it will be necessary to inform the reader that by idiom we
    would here be understood to mean that general mode of arranging word into sentence
    which prevails in any particular language  and by the genius of a language we
    mean to express the particular set of idea which the word of any language either
    from their formation or multiplicity are most naturally apt to excite in the mind
    of any one who hears it properly uttered thus although the english french italian
    and spanish language nearly agree in the same general idiom yet the particular
    genius of each is remarkably different the english is naturally bold nervous and
    strongly articulated  the french is weaker and more flowing the italian more soothing
    and harmonious and the spanish more grave sonorous and stately now when we examine
    the several language which have been most esteemed in europe we find that there
    are only two idiom among them which are essentially distinguished from one another
    and all those language are divided between these two idiom following sometimes
    the one and sometimes the other either wholly or in part the language which may
    be said to adhere to the first idiom are those which in their construction follow
    the order of nature  that is express their idea in the natural order in which
    they occur to the mind the subject which occasion the action appearing first then
    the action accompanied with it several modification and last of all the object
    to which it ha reference these may properly be called analogous language and of
    this kind are the english french and most of the modern language in europe the
    language which may be referred to the other idiom are those which follow no other
    order in their construction tnan what the taste or fancy of the composer may suggest
    sometimes making the object sometimes the action and sometimes the modification
    of the action to precede or follow the other part the confusion which this might
    occasion is avoided by the particular manner of inflecting their word by which
    they are made to refer to the others with which they ought to be connected in
    whatever part of the sentence they occur the mind being left at liberty to connect
    the several part with one another after the whole sentence is concluded  and a
    the word may be here transposed at pleasure those language may be called transpositive
    language to this class we must in an especial manner refer the latin and greek
    language a each of these idiom ha several advantage and defect peculiar to itself
    we shall endeavour language to point out the most considerable of them in order
    to ascertain with greater precision the particular character and excellence of
    some of those language now principally spoken or studied in europe the partiality
    which our forefather at the revival of letter in europe naturally entertained
    for the greek and roman language made them look upon every distinguishing peculiarity
    belonging to them a one of the many cause of the amazing superiority which those
    language evidently enjoyed above every other at that time spoken in europe this
    blind deference still continues to be paid to them a our mind are early prepossessed
    with these idea and a we are taught in our earliest infancy to believe that to
    entertain the least idea of our own language being equal to the greek or latin
    in any particular whatever would be a certain mark of ignorance or want of taste
    their right therefore like those of the church in former age remain still to be
    examined and we without exerting our reason to discover truth from falsehood tamely
    sit down satisfied with the idea of their undoubted preeminence in every respect
    but if we look around u for a moment and observe the many excellent production
    which are to be met with in almost every language of europe we must be satisfied
    that even these are now possessed of some power which might afford at least a
    presumption that if they were cultivated with a proper degree of attention they
    might in some respect be made to rival if not to excel those beautiful and justly
    admired remains of antiquity without endeavouring to derogate from their merit
    let u with the cool eye of philosophic reasoning endeavour to bring before the
    sacred tribunal of truth some of those opinion which have been most generally
    received upon this subject and rest the determination of the cause on her impartial
    decision the learned reader well know that the several change which take place
    in the arrangement of the word in every transpositive language could not be admitted
    without occasioning great confusion unless certain class of word were endowed
    with particular variation by mean of which they might be made to refer to the
    other word  with which they ought naturally to be connected from this cause proceeds
    the necessity of several variation of verb noun and adjective  which are not in
    the least essential or necessary in the analogous language a we have pretty fully
    explained under the article grammar to which we refer for satisfaction on this
    head we shall in this place consider whether these variation are an advantage
    or a disadvantage to language a it is generally supposed that every language the
    verb of which admit of inflection is on that account much more perfect than one
    where they are varied by auxiliary we shall in the first place examine this with
    some degree of the e lei edition of this work we are far from adopting the very
    unphilosophical opinion which it support we do not asseit because we could have
    nothing like evidence for such an assertion that the deity did not originallv
    p bestow on man the gift of speech  but we think with lord monboddo and many others
    that if such a boon ever wa conferred it must in the revolution an h it   ri bef
    t lle  n the lu  man race  inevitably have been lost and therefore that a multitude
    of language exist and have evei existed the art of speech is one which man is
    capable of attaining to independently of any supernatural aid  this is the view
    taken by our best philosopher thus mr stewart notwithstanding hi allknown caudon

    human faculty are competent to the formation of language philosophy of the mind
    vol m chap  in another place the same admirable writer make the following philosophical
    observation on this subjectthe step in the formation oflanguage cannot probably
    be determined with certainty  yet if we can show from the known principle of human
    nature how the various part may naturally have arisen the mind is not only to
    a certain decree satisfied but a check is given to that indolent philosophy which
    refers to a miracle whatever appearance either in the natural or moral world it
    is unable to explain one of the most ingenious attempt that ever ha been made
    to show by what step the human mind would naturally proceed in the acquisition
    of speech is that contained in dr adam smith  consideration on the formation of
    language his theory may perhaps be liable to objection in some of it detail but
    it is developed with singular clearness and simplicity and it must in it general
    scope and design be allowed by all candid and competent judge to beaminently philosophical

    reason of the equal splendour of their talent although in other respect they were
    extremely unlike they were of the same intellectual stature but differently moulded  the
    one being remarkable for gracefulness of manner and symmetry of power with much
    elegance and refinement the other plainer and withal le polished but distinguished
    for perfect sincerity ardent piety and undeviating love of truth the society and
    conversation of hall had great influence on mackintosh mind their controversy
    were almost unceasing even at this early period hall  displayed the same acuteness
    and brilliancy the same extraordinary vigour both of understanding and imagination
    which have since distinguished him and which would have secured to him much more
    of the admiration of the learned and the elegant if he had not consecrated his
    genius to the far nobler office of instructing and reforming the poor a  in the
    spring of  having previously taken his degree of master of art he finally quitted
    king college  with he say  but little regular and exact knowledge but with considerable
    activity of mind and boundless literary ambition and in the october following
    he set out for edinburgh to commence the study of physic which he had made choice
    of a a profession his arrival in that city opened a new world to his mind edinburgh
    wa then the residence of many eminent men  of adam smith dr black john home henry
    mackenzie dr cullen principal robertson dr ferguson dr hutton professor robison
    mr dugald stewart and others and although his age did not allow him to be much
    acquainted with these celebrated person yet accident furnished him with opportunity
    of access to some of them whilst the concentration of so much genius and talent
    produced a powerful impression on his ardent and susceptible nature his speculative
    turn of mind however soon betrayed itself within a few week after his arrival
    in edinburgh he became a zealous partisan of brown who had just become a teacher
    of medicine and the founder of a new medical system  and having been elected a
    member of the medical society he in a few month  before he could have distinguished
    bark from james powder or a pleurisy from a dropsy in the chamber of a sick patient
    discussed with the utmost fluency and confidence the most difficult question in
    the science of medicine but he had soon an opportunity of displaying his peculiar
    talent on a theatre better fitted for the exercise of his power he wa admitted
    a member of the speculative society which had been established about twenty year
    before and during that period numbered amongst it member all the distinguished
    youth in scotland besides many foreigner attracted to edinburgh by the fame of
    it medical school in this society which had general literature and science for
    it object he found some congenial spirit of whom he ha left very graphic sketch
    particularly malcolm laing the historian john w t ilde afterwards professor of
    the civil law in the university of edinburgh benjamin constant adam gillie now
    lord gillie and several other young men who afterwards rose to eminence or attained
    distinction in different pursuit in this exciting atmosphere speculation rather
    than study engrossed his attention youth the season of humble diligence and laborious
    application wa wasted a he himself complains in vast mack vain and fruitless project
    speculator indeed are seldom submissive learner those who will make proficiency
    in useful knowledge must for a time trust to their teacher and believe in their
    superiority but those who too early think for themselves must sometimes imagine
    themselves wiser than their master  and hence docility is often extinguished when
    the work of education is scarcely commenced after three year spent in irregular
    application he became a candidate for a degree  and having obtained his diploma
    he quitted edinburgh in the month of september  with a large stock of miscellaneous
    information acquired by habitual though desultory reading but without having concentrated
    his power upon any one pursuit or given to professional subject that systematic
    and methodical attention which is indispensable to the attainment of professional
    eminence early in  he set out for london accompanied by one of his college friend
    and arrived on that great theatre of action at a moment sufficiently distracting
    for one of more advanced age and more settled pursuit an ardent enthusiast for
    political amelioration he came in contact with society when it wa already heaving
    with the first throe of that great convulsion which wa soon to overturn all the
    institution of a neighbouring country and to shake those of every other to their
    lowest foundation to a young man like mr mackintosh a period of such excitement
    had irresistible allurement he had cultivated habit of public speaking both at
    aberdeen and at edinburgh  he wa fond of moral and political controversy rather
    perhaps a an exercise of the reasoning power than with any view to the formation
    of settled opinion he found on the subject of politics the boldest speculation
    in which his mind had been engaged about to receive a practical application  and
    he longed to mingle in the discussion if not to take part in the scene which distinguished
    that memorable time still his view were in the first instance at least directed
    to the medical profession and he wa led from circumstance to contemplate a medical
    appointment in russia but this project in which he wa supported by mr dugald stewart
    did not take effect and it is probable that he felt but little regret at the failure
    of a scheme which would have removed him from such a scene of interest and enjoyment
    a london then presented in the same year his father death freed him from the little
    control which a soldier of careless and social habit had attempted to exercise
    over a studious youth and a the succession to his paternal estate of kellachie
    brought with it but little advantage to his mean his habitual profusion in money
    matter soon involved him in pecuniary difficulty his next step wa one which seemed
    but little calculated to diminish them on the th of february  he wa privately
    married to miss catharine stuart a young lady of a respectable scotch family and
    at the age of twentyfour he found himself with no prospect of any immediate professional
    settlement his little fortune rapidly diminishing and a wife to provide for the
    struggle regarding the regency that followed the announcement of the malady with
    which the king had been attacked in the autumn of  wa the occasion of a pamphlet
    by mr mackintosh in support of the analogy which mr fox endeavoured to establish
    between the actual state of his majesty and a natural demise of the crown this
    seems to have been his first public appearance in the field of politics for which
    his mind had now taken a decided turn about the same time he made the acquaintance

  text: s m e  ie his next publication wa  an address to the people of  scotland on
    the nature power and privilege of jury by a juryman edinb  vo this tract is entitled
    to particular notice because it contains a clear and judicious exposition of legal
    principle very important in themselves and at that period very little understood  it
    is he remark a common notion that juryman are judge of theac only and not of the
    laiv this absurd and often fatal prejudice is much more prevalent than might be
    expected in a city like this where general knowledge ought to be pretty widely
    diffused it ha perhaps been too much fostered by the injunction of judgesand magistrate
    it is exceedingly natural that plain simple juryman should look up with veneration
    to the high rank and superior ability of those men who are appointed by their
    sovereign to dispense justice over the nation for this reason it is that the english
    judge are so extremely solicitous not to inculcate their own opinion on the mind
    of juryman but to leave their determination solely to the dictate of their own
    conscience but from whatever source this prejudice may have derived it origin
    i shall endeavour to shew that it ha neither law nor common sense for it support
    a further specimen may very satisfactorily be produced  i know it to be the opinion
    of many juryman that after the court admits a relevancy they are bound by their
    oath to find the libel either proved or not proved but these gentleman should
    consider that their business is to give a verdict of a very different kind they
    are to judge both of the criminality of the culprit and of his exculpatory evidence
    the word proved or not proved should be for ever banished from the verdict of
    jury a relevancy may be found when the juryman who hear the indictment impugned
    are of an opposite opinion from the court a crime may be libelled when the fact
    related in the indictment though completely proved do not constitute the essence
    of the crime charged hence whenever the mind of juryman are convinced that a relevancy
    ha been improperly found their verdict however the proof may stand should be not
    guilt i indeed the expression guilty or not guilty ought alone to be employed
    in verdict this tract excited a considerable degree of attention  and it wa quoted
    with much approbation by lord erskine in his famous speech in defence of dr shipley
    dean of st asaph he published several other pamphlet which chiefly related to
    local politics but the most elaborate of his wwks is  the philosophy of natural
    history edinb  to this is an ingenious book written in a very pleasing style and
    it accordingly experienced a favourable reception it wa reprinted at dublin and
    philadelphia lichtenstein published a german translation to which some note were
    added by c a w zimmermann for the original volume charles elliot agreed to pay
    one thousand guinea at six twelve and eighteen month a well a a certain sum for
    every edition after the first this enterprising bookseller died before the work
    wa ready for publication but the agreement wa mnourably fulfilled by his trustee
    though the benefit accrued not to the author himself but to his family  this say
    mr kerr wa probably the largest sum that had ever been given at least in edinburgh
    for the literary property of a single quarto volume and evinced both the libera
    ity of the bookseller and the high estimation in which he very justly held the
    fame and talent of the author his plan however wa not yet completed and he immelately
    applied himself to the preparation of a second volume e ived to bring it to a
    conclusion though not to make a ny arrangement for it publication during the last
    year  is ife his health appears to have been infirm and precanous i n june  he
    stated to his friend dr hutton a he had for several month been distressed with
    a debi v m m limb accompanied with a want of appetite  and  another medical friend
    dr gardiner we find him statl l i e ing very unfavourable symptom in the course
    of the following year after a long illness he died on the th of june  at the age
    of sixtyfive he left a widow with four son and four daughter two son and three
    daughter having died before their father his eldest daughter wa married to mr
    george watson an eminent portraitpainter in edinburgh smellie had never been in
    affluent circumstance but he left to his family the mean of prosperity and the
    printing business ha been more successfully conducted by his son mr alexander
    smellie of his philosophy of natural history the second volume wa published by
    this son in the year another posthumous work speedily followed  literary and characteristical
    life of john gregory md henry home lord kames david hume esq and adam smith ll
    d to which are added a dissertation on public spirit and three essay edinb  vo
    his original plan comprehended the life of other twentyfive men of literary eminence
    with whom he wa personally acquainted one of these wa his friend dr stuart with
    whose private history he wa sufficiently familiar and of which he could have supplied
    very curious though perhaps not very edifying detail it is not however a subject
    of much regret that his plan wa never completed in the specimen with which we
    have thus been presented there is too little biography and too much discussion
    this remark is more particularly applicable to the life of dr gregory which extends
    to  page but is almost entirely occupied with an account not of the writer but
    of his writing the other life are of le extent in his account of hume he relates
    without any symptom of disapprobation the indecent levity with which he sported
    on the verge of another world and in the same manner he likewise repeat the declaration
    of dr smith a to the character of that philosopher  i have always considered him
    both in his lifetime and since his death a approaching a nearly to the idea of
    a perfectly wise and virtuous man a perhaps the nature of human frailty will permit
    this ingenious printer may himself have been somewhat too anxious to be classed
    among philosopher smellie appears to have been a man of excellent talent and of
    extensive knowledge his disposition wa social his habit were convivial and he
    wa distinguished by a sarcastic vein of wit and humour according to the description
    of his biographer he wa about the middle size and had been in his youth welllooked
    and active  but when rather past the middle of life he had acquired from almost
    constantly stooping at his desk to write or correct a rather lounging gait and
    appearance and from a longcontinued series of difficulty in his affair and much
    disappointment in matter of affectionate moment he had become careless and rather
    slovenly in his dress and appearance  wearing his hair long and bushy his ordinary
    black and widemade clothes ill brushed and well sprinkled w ith snuff and his
    usual oldfashioned cocked hat for the most part rusty burn describes him a  a
    man positively of the first ability and greatest strength of mind a well a one
    of the best heart and keenest wit that he had ever met with  and in the following

    proposition that the interest of the individual and of the community in a free
    commerce are the same we need not repeat  because it can neither be rendered more
    clear nor more cogent than it is already in work with which every person is familiar
    who is at all conversant with political science  from this principle m de gournay
    concluded that the sole duty of government with regard to commerce are  to render
    to all the branch of industry that precious liberty of which the prejudice of
    barbarous time the proneness of government to lend themselves to the gratification
    of individual interest and the pursuit of a mistaken good have conspired to deprive
    them   to facilitate the exercise of industry and ingenuity to every member of
    the community exciting thereby the greatest competition among seller and ensuring
    the greatest perfection and cheapness of the commodity sold   to admit the greatest
    competition among buyer by opening to the seller every possible market the sole
    mean of encouraging reproduction which hence derives it only reward  to remove
    every obstacle by which the progress of industry is retarded by depriving it of
    it natural reward it is to m de gournay therefore that turgot ascribes the origin
    of political economy in france  it is to the  ardour say he  with which m de gournay
    endeavoureconoed to direct to the study of commerce and of political ecomists
    nomy all the talent which he wa able to discover and to the facility with which
    he communicated the light which he himself had acquired that we ought to ascribe
    the happy fermentation which for some year ha been excited on these important
    subject a fermentation which arose two or three year after m de gournay wa intendant
    of commerce and ha since that time procured u several work calculated to wipe
    off from our nation that reproach of frivolity which by it indifference for the
    more useful study it had but too justly incurred francis quesnay wa born in the
    village of ecqueville in the year  according to m dupont de nemours the editor
    and commentator of the work of turgot and a zealous economist he wa the son of
    a small proprietor who cultivated his own little property  and he wa eminently
    indebted to his mother for the fashion of his mind though he wa educated a a physician
    and rose to such eminence in his profession a to be first physician to the king
    the early occupation of his mind on the business of agriculture had given the
    current of his thought a permanent direction  and when he wa summoned to reflect
    on the source of wealth by the discussion probably to which the speculation of
    m de gournay had given birth agriculture wa the object on which his attention
    wa more particularly fixed he produced several work on different point of the
    science and practice of medicine  and it wa only at a late period of life that
    his work on political economy appeared his chief production on this subject physiocralie
    ou du gouvernement le plus avantageux au genre humain wa first published in  not
    only had the speculation which he broached and which he propagated with much fervour
    and diligence considerable success in the world but he had the fortune to gain
    a considerable number of proselyte who exerted themselves with an ardour for the
    diffusion of his doctrine and with a devotion to the opinion of their master which
    more resembled the enthusiasm of the votary of a new religion or that of the follower
    of some of the ancient philosopher than the indifference with which new speculation
    in philosophy have on all other occasion been received in modern europe and which
    gave to the economist more of the character of a sect or a school than ha appeared
    to belong to those who have in recent time concurred in any other system of philosophical
    opinion there wa in truth in the system of m quesnay and the other economist many
    thing well calculated to attract attention and excite enthusiasm from a few simple
    principle they deduced a they imagined by a chain of very close and imposing argument
    a system of change which would easily be introduced without the smallest interruption
    to the tranquillity and happiness of the existing generation calculated to remove
    from society all the deformity by which it wa overspread and to communicate to
    the mass of human being a fulness of happiness hitherto altogether unknown at
    this point therefore we may close the historical part of this article  tor the
    success of the great work of dr adam smith in a short time superseded the political
    economy of the sect and after the political economy wa discredited the rest of
    their doctrine met with little regard i he memory of them however is well worthy
    of being preserved and this task we shall now in a few word a possible endeavour
    to perform ii the economist proceeded upon no utopian plan which supposes society
    to be composed of being different from those with whom we are already acquainted
    they took man a he is a being having want and governed by the desire of avoiding
    pain and obtaining pleasure

    depend upon the opinion of the thing which act in moral on the other hand the
    thing which are depended upon for counteraction change their duration according
    to their opinion a theory which supposes that to be uniform and constant which
    is known to be the reverse is evidently absurd suppose every thing which the theory
    need to be supposed conceive an assembly or assembly provided to counteract the
    sovereign and so constituted a to form the most perfect counteraction possible
    that the sovereign can ordain nothing but with the consent of the assembly and
    the assembly nothing but with the consent of the sovereign in this case it is
    not a government of one but a government of many each member of the assembly share
    in the sovereignty they are so many partner therefore with a particular partner
    at their head the question is what are the interest of the partnership those of
    the nation or not the interest of the partnership doubtless are to make it a profitable
    to the member a possible for it would be absurd to suppose them not governed by
    their private interest suppose then that there is originally a tendency to counteraction
    between the sovereign and the assembly it is very obvious that they will put an
    end to this counteraction a far a they discover that the suspension of it is conducive
    to their private interest this is a law of nature and may be taken for granted
    a far then a the serving of the private interest of the member is concerned there
    is no balance of opposite force the force combine instead of opposing and so far
    the balance is lost the loss of the balance to this extent may be a loss engrossing
    the whole of the protection to the common interest which it wa expected to yield
    or it may be a loss not extending so far if it go to the whole extent of that
    protection there is to the purpose in question no balance at all if it doe not
    go to the whole extent there will still be some balance more or le what then is
    the case  the case is that the loss go to the whole and that the balance doe not
    exist the balance doe not exist a far a the private interest of those who share
    among them the governing power are concerned but it is only from the private interest
    of those who govern that the nation ha any thing to fear it is only against these
    interest that the balance is provided a far however a these private interest are
    concerned the balance doe not exist a far therefore a the balance is even supposed
    to be of any service the balance is excluded by the law of nature it follows a
    a corollary that in a country where the people depend upon what is called a balance
    a the whole of their security for good government they have no security at all
    such is the analysis which the economist present of the cause of good and evil
    in human society and of that order of thing which best insures the presence of
    the one and the absence of the other that part of their doctrine which alone is
    yet known to the mere english reader their political economy is introduced a only
    an auxiliary exposition it is part of the development by which they endeavoured
    to prove the identity which they supposed between the interest of the sovereign
    and the interest of the people but a a very distinct account of this part of their
    system ha been given by dr adam smith and other writer and a our object rather
    wa the exhibition of those doctrine of the sect which nobody ha yet presented
    to our countryman in their own language we shall content ourselves with only marking
    the place which their political economy held in their general system a the society
    ha public expense it is necessary that it also have a public revenue to reconcile
    the formation ecoi of a public revenue with the idea of social order it ought
    mi to be formed if possible without infringing the property y of individual for
    the sake of which the order of society itself is established it ought therefore
    if possible to be formed without diminishing the revenue of individual when the
    real origin of revenue the source from which it all is drawn is sufficiently understood
    the mode of forming a revenue for the sovereign without diminishing that of individual
    would be immediately apparent the source of all rich is the land because the land
    alone of all the source of production yield a produce greater than the cost of
    the production the surplus produce of the land therefore constitutes a fund which
    is over and above the remuneration to the agent of production and out of which
    the revenue of the sovereign may be taken without diminishing the motive to production
    that is without retarding the natural progress of the state in wealth population
    and felicity to lay the foundation for this plan of a public revenue it wa necessary
    to prove that the land is the only source of production and that manufacture and
    commerce though they alter the form of thing never add any thing to the amount
    or value of production in the development ol these view one of the most remarkable
    result at which the economist arrived wa the necessity of perfect freedom to all
    the proceeding which lead to production  a giving to produce that form which is
    most agreeable to those who are to make use of it till the time of the economist
    the necessity of holding those proceeding in chain and binding them to the will
    of government wa the universal doctrine of government and to a great degree of
    speculator themselves the general principle of the economist respecting ie freedom
    of property necessary to constitute the foundation of social order led them to
    infer the evil of those abridgment of freedom but they examined the inference
    in detail and showed that the meddling officiousness of government to compel industry
    to one thing and exclude it from another not only failed to effect any good purpose
    but of necessity created obstruction of the greatest magnitude to production in
    general and tended powerfully to keep down the wealth population and prosperity
    of the state the light which they diffused on this subject and which soon produced
    a grand effect on the mind of men wa a good the magnitude of which is beyond calculation
    another of their conclusion is that the revenue of the sovereign taken a they
    said it ought to be wholly from the net produce of the land ought to be a fixed
    and unalterable proportion of that produce the reason appeared to them conclusive
    if the proportion wa variable and depended upon the will of the owner of the land
    they might be induced to break upon the public revenue and deprive the state of
    those benefit which the public revenue is necessary to produce if it depended
    upon the sovereign the property of the land might be detached from that of it
    produce nobody would have a motive to become a proprietor in land and all the
    advantage which depend on the existence of that property would be lost the production
    of subsistence would fail and the community could not exist this proportion being
    once fixed there is no longer any contrariety between the interest of the sovereign
    and the interest of any portion of his people  and the proprietor of land are
    a completely and securely exempt from contributing to the expense of the state
    a any other class of the community the sovereign derives no part of his revenue
    from the subject and this deplorable source of the conflict of interest is wholly
    cut off the proportion being settled for ever between the sovereign and the land

    professorship of anatomy but the latter branch of medical study wa either not
    so suitable to his taste or he did not consider himself so well qualified to be
    useful in it for soon after arrangement were made with the professor of medicine
    by which the professor exchanged department dr black undertaking that of the institute
    and practice of medicine at this time his lecture on medicine formed his chief
    occupation  while the perspicuity and simplicity the caution and moderation which
    he discovered in the doctrine which he delivered gave great satisfaction the time
    and attention which were occupied in these lecture and in the medical practice
    in some measure necessarily connected with his situation are supposed by some
    to have been the principal cause of dr black having suddenly stopped short in
    that brilliant career on which he had at first so successfully entered it is more
    probable however that the calm and unambitious temper which seems to have formed
    a striking feature of his character and which a le friendly hand than his learned
    biographer might have set down a nearly allied to indolence checked the ardour
    and perseverance which were necessary to excite and carry him forward in the path
    of research and discovery whatever may have been the cause it is to be regretted
    that dr black so conspicuous for his patient judicious and elegant mode of investigation
    and so distinguished for the simplicity perspicuity and precision of his reasoning
    and deduction should have contributed so little in rearing the noble superstructure
    of chemical science the foundation of which he had been the mean of establishing
    on a firm and solid basis the theory of the nature of quicklime and the cause
    of it causticity soon became known to the german chemist and from them it met
    with strong opposition various mysterious doctrine at this time prevailed in the
    german school concerning the peculiar nature of fire  and a the notion there entertained
    of the causticity of alkaline substance involved some of these doctrine a great
    many objection were started to a theory which threatened to overthrow long established
    and favourite opinion the most formidable opponent of the new theory wa professor
    meyer of osnaburg all the phenomenon of the causticity and mildness of lime and
    alkali were according to his explanation to be accounted for by the action of
    a substance of a peculiar nature to which he gave the name of acidum pingue this
    substance which wa supposed to be formed in the lime during calcination consisted
    of an igneous matter in a certain state of combination with other substance it
    is a matter of some surprise that dr black should have experienced any uneasiness
    on account of the opposition made to this discovery on mere hypothesis unsupported
    by fact or even by plausible argument when his own doctrine had been fully and
    irrefragably established by the test of decisive experiment nor is it le surprising
    that in the course of his lecture for several year he should have taken great
    pain in refuting the argument and in combating the objection of meyer dr black
    reception at the university of glasgow wa highly flattering and encouraging a
    a student he had not only done himself much credit by his successful progress
    in the different pursuit in which he wa engaged but he had also during his residence
    there conciliated in a high degree the attachment and affection of the professor
    when he returned a a professor he immediately became connected in the strictest
    friendship with dr bl adam smith then professor of moral philosophy in that dr
    j ph university and the friendship thus commenced grew    stronger and stronger
    and wa never interrupted throughout the whole of their life a simplicity and sensibility
    an incorruptible integrity the strictest delicacy and singular correctness of
    manner marked the character of each of these philosopher and firmly bound them
    together in the closest union at glasgow dr black soon acquired great reputation
    a a professor and became a favourite physician in that large and active city his
    engaging countenance his agreeable and attractive manner free from all studied
    endeavour to please and the kind concern he took in the case intrusted to his
    care made him a most welcome visitor in every family it wa between the year  and  that
    he brought to maturity his speculation concerning heat which had occupied his
    attention at interval from the very first dawn of his philosophical investigation
    his discovery in this department of science were by far the most important of
    all that he made and perhaps indeed among the most valuable which appeared during
    the busy period of the eighteenth century to enter fully into the nature of his
    investigation would be improper in this place  but the sum of them all wa usually
    expressed by him in the following proposition when a solid body is converted into
    a fluid there enters into it and unites with it a quantity of heat the presence
    of which is not indicated by the thermometer and this combination is the cause
    of the fluidity which the body assumes on the other hand when a fluid body is
    converted into a solid a quantity of heat separate from it the presence of which
    wa not formerly indicated by the thermometer and this separation is the cause
    of the solid form which the fluid assumes when a liquid body is raised to the
    boiling temperature by the continued and copious application of heat it particle
    suddenly attract to themselves a great quantity of heat and by this combination
    their mutual relation is so changed that they no longer attract each other but
    are converted into an elastic fluid like air on the other hand when these elastic
    fluid either by condensation or by the application of cold body are reconverted
    into liquid they give out a vast quantity of heat the presence of which wa not
    formerly indicated by the thermometer thus water when converted into ice give
    out  of heat ice when converted into water absorbs  of heat and water when converted
    into steam absorbs about  of heat without becoming sensibly hotter than  philosopher
    had long been accustomed to consider the thermometer a the surest method of detecting
    heat m body yet this instrument give no indication of the  of heat which enter
    into air when it is converted into water nor of the  which combine with water
    when it is converted into steam dr black therefore said that the heat is concealed
    jatet in the water and steam and he briefly expressed this fact by calling the
    heat in that case latent heat dr black having established this discovery by simple
    and decisive experiment drew up an account of the whole investigation and read
    it to a literary society which met every friday in the facultyroom of the college

    from which rent is paid and there is no authentic record of the price of butchermeat
    wool cheese butter and other article in every county to refer to a there is of
    corn this is not the place to inquire whether the price of corn regulates the
    price of all the other product of land in a country whose statutebooks are full
    of duty bounty drawback c to say nothing of it internal regulation  but it is
    sufficiently evident that if corn doe posse this power it price operates too slowly
    on that of other product to serve a a just criterion for determining rent on a
    lease of this duration besides in the progress of agriculture new specie or variety
    of the cerealia themselves are established even in so short a period a twentyone
    year the price of which may be very different from that of the corn specified
    in the lease what security for a full rent for instance would it give to a landlord
    to make the rent payable according to the price of barley when the tenant might
    find it more for his interest to cultivate some of the variety of summer wheat  or
    according to the price of a particular variety of oat when within a few year we
    have seen all the old variety superseded throughout extensive district by the
    introduction of a new one the potatooat which may not be more permanent than those
    that preceded it  there may be no impropriety in adopting this plan for ascertaining
    the rent of land kept always in tillage but it would be idle to expect any important
    benefit from it during such a lease a we have mentioned in some instance it is
    the practice to agree for a certain rent in money which doe not vary and another
    portion is determined from time to time by the price of corn the quantity and
    kind of the corn only being previously fixed by the lease this we think is a better
    plan than to make the whole rent vary with the price of corn with regard to much
    longer lease this plan will no doubt diminish the evil which we think are inseparable
    from them but it cannot possibly reach some of the most considerable it utmost
    effect is to secure to the landholder a rent which shall in all time to come be
    an adequate rent according to the state of the land and the mode of cultivation
    known at the date of the lease but it can make no provision that will apply to
    the enlargement of the gross produce from the future improvement of the land themselves
    or of the disposable produce from the invention of machinery and other plan for
    economizing labour old cornrents therefore though much higher at present than
    old moneyrents are seldom or never so high a the rent that could now be paid on
    a lease of twentyone year but independently of these consideration which more
    immediately bear upon the interest of the party themselves one insuperable objection
    to all such lease is that they partake too much of the nature of entail and depart
    too far from that commercial character which is most favourable to the investment
    of capital and consequently to the greatest increase of land produce nt a lease
    for a term of year is not however in all case a sufficient encouragement to spirited
    cultivation it covenant in respect to the management of the land may te injudicious
    the tenant may be so strictly confined to a particular mode of culture or a particular
    course of crop a not to be able to avail himself of the beneficial discovery which
    a progressive state of agriculture never ai s to introduce or on the other hand
    though this is oiuch more rare the tenant may be left so entirely at  erty that
    either the necessity of his circumstance durvol ii  mg the currency of the lease
    or his interest towards it agriculexpiration may lead him to exhaust the soil
    instead of ture  rendering it more productive when a lease therefore is either
    redundant or deficient in this respectwhen it either permit the land to be deteriorated
    or prevents their improvementthe connection between landlord and tenant is formed
    upon other view and regulated by some other principle than the general one on
    which we think it should be founded notwithstanding the high authority of adam
    smithrestrictive covenant are always necessary to the security of the landlord
    and in some case beneficial also to the tenant their expediency cannot well be
    questioned in those part of the country where an improved system of agriculture
    ha made little progress a landholder assisted by the advice of experienced men
    in framing these covenant cannot adopt any easier or le offensive plan for the
    improvement of his property and the ultimate advantage of his tenantry even in
    the best cultivated district while farm continue to be let to the highest responsible
    offerer a few restrictive covenant cannot be dispensed with the supposed interest
    of the tenant is too feeble a security for correct management even during the
    eailier part of a lease and in the latter part of it it is thought to be his interest
    in most case to exhaust the soil a much a possible not only for the sake of immediate
    profit but frequently in order to deter competitor and thus to obtain a renewal
    of his lease at a rent somewhat le than the land would otherwise bring with tenant
    at will and such a hold on short lease restrictive covenant are more necessary
    than with tenant on lease of  or  year but in many instance they are too numerous
    and complicated and sometimes even inconsistent with the best course of modern
    husbandry the great error lie in prescribing rule by which a tenant is positively
    required to act not in prohibiting such practice and such crop a experience ha
    not sanctioned i he improved knowledge and the liberality of the age have now
    expunged the most objectionable of these covenant and throughout whole county
    almost the only restriction in reference to the course of crop is that the tenant
    shall not take two culmiferous crop ripening their seed in close succession this
    single stipulation combined with the obligation to consume the straw upon the
    farm and to apply to it all the manure made from it produce is sufficient not
    only to protect the land from exhaustion but to insure in a great measure it regular
    cultivation for half the farm at least must in this case be always under either
    fallow or green crop the only other necessary covenant when the soil is naturally
    too weak for carrying annual crop without intermission is that a certain portion
    of the land shall be always in grass not to be cut for hay but depastured according
    to the extent of this will be the interval between the succession of corn crop
    on the same field if it is agreed that half the farm for instance shall always
    be under grass there can be only two crop of corn from the same field in six year
    in this case not more than twosixths being in corn onesixth in green crop or fallow
    and threesixths in clover or grass it becomes almost impossible to exhaust any
    soil at all fitted for tillage there are few indeed that do not gradually become
    more fertile under this course of cropping it is sufficiently evident that other
    covenant are necessary in particular circumstance such a permission to dispose
    of straw hay and other crop from which manure is made when a quantity of manure
    equal to what they would have furnished is got from other place and a prohibition

    in the only way compatible with his precarious existence namely by publishing
    a violent diatribe entitled denonciation de vagiotage in which personality were
    accumulated without reserve against both calonne and necker the consequence wa
    an order of the king which condemned the pamphleteer to imprisonment in the castle
    of saumur but mirabeau evaded the intended punishment and having placed himself
    in safety published the suite de la denonciation  and in his lettres a m lacretelle
    a well a in his correspondance avec cerutti he scrupled not to assail the reputation
    of necker which wa then at it height these production appear to have made a considerable
    impression in fact mirabeau gained much celebrity by his polemical writing at
    a time when political subject had not yet entered into the circulation of common
    idea when the art of pamphleteering wa scarcely cultivated and only a small number
    of writer ventured to engage in this specie of warfare they were attractive novelty  and
    their effect wa enhanced by his dogmatic and tranchant manner of handling subject
    which he had scarcely studied and especially by the haughty and arrogant tone
    which he assumed towards his adversary but if he had aggrandized his reputation
    a a writer his personal character had sunk to the very lowest possible state of
    degradation his discreditable employment a a sort of licensed spy at berlin his
    open connection with the enemy of necker and his ingratitude to calonne made him
    be regarded a a dangerous enemy and a slippery friend  whilst his lawsuit with
    his family his elopement his imprisonment and his moral could not be overlooked
    even in a city so lax a paris  and hence his name wa pronounced with detestation
    and his company shunned q if he had carried about with him some deadly infection
    but common fame is almost always in excess either on the one side or the other
    he wa by no mean the abandoned and demoralized monster he wa at this time generally
    thought to be  on the contrary there were high and redeeming quality in his nature
    which afterwards displayed themselves on a great theatre of action and amidst
    alfhis excess he never lost his respect for virtue nor his taste for the society
    of those whose principle and habit formed a perfect contrast to his own in  his
    monarchic prussienne appeared at paris in eight volume vo with an atlas in folio
    this production consisted of a work written for him by major mauvillon and of
    extract from different memoir procured at great expense no one can for a moment
    suppose that during a residence of only eight month at berlin mirabeau could himself
    have executed a work of such magnitude in which every possible information had
    been introduced respecting t e geography production manufacture commerce and military
    condition of prussia a well a concerning the reigion education legislation and
    administrative system of that country but he had the merit of employing the talent
    of an officer who wa scarcely known to the government he served and the prussian
    minister must have een much surprised at finding that a man who had reside so
    short a time in the country could singly undertake so arduous a task and succeed
    in supplying them with more material than could be found in the united office
    o their several department  the work say dumont j an illustration by fact of adam
    smith principle of po itical economy  and it clearly prof that prussia ha a way
    been a sufferer whenever she ha departed from these principle his next publication
    wa one of a much le creditable c aracter  he histoire secrete du cabinet de berlin
    is an m iscreet revelation of the diplomatic manoeuvre of mirabeau written in
    a spirit of bitter criticism with all the icentious freedom of a libel and it
    excited general indigvol xv   nation against the author who had unscrupulously
    violated mirabeau the secret of hospitality and the confidence of his friend s
    v a well a that of the government in order to supply pabuum to public malignity
    in this disgraceful production the emperor joseph ii the king of prussia and particularly
    prince henry who wa then at paris were all equally ill treated louis xvi conceived
    that some satisfaction wa due to the diplomatic corp who had been so grossly assailed
    and accordingly the libel wa adjudged by the parliament to be burned by the hand
    of the common hangman the worst passage of mirabeau life is the publication of
    the letter to sophie but that of the berlin correspondence is equally without
    justification although on different ground in extenuation of this proceeding it
    ha been observed that the whole object of his existence depended upon the supply
    which it furnished  that without it his election in provence wmuld have been hopeless
    but this is a sorry topic even of palliation great event were now near at hand
    on the th of december  the longexpected royal proclamation appeared definitively
    convoking the statesgeneral for may  need we ask whether mirabeau now bestirred
    himself whether or not he wa off to provence to the assembly of the noblesse with
    all his faculty screwed to the stickmgplace  a prospect had at length opened to
    him of rising superior to the humiliation of his youth and the contempt attached
    to the precarious and degraded life he had led  he seems to have had a presentiment
    of the part which he wa soon destined to perform in a mighty revolution now about
    to commence  and he lost no time in taking mean to bring about the accomplishment
    of his destiny in the list of the popular candidate his name wa accordingly proclaimed
    in all part of provence beside that of raynal and he laboured with unwearied activity
    in stimulating public feeling proclaiming the necessity of political regeneration
    denouncing abuse exposing tyranny and misgovernment agitating and contending by
    day writing pamphlet and paragraph by night and in short strainmg every nerve
    to attain the first and grand object of his ambition nevertheless when he presented
    himself in the assembly of the noblesse to vote with his peer the latter excluded
    him upon the pretence that the possessor of fief alone had the right of sitting
    amongst them against this fatal decision which confirmed the alienation of the
    most dangerous enemy which the ignorance and insolence of a privileged order raised
    up for their own overthrow mirabeau protested in eloquent and energetic term exposing
    the folly of his order and prognosticating the doom which it wa now preparing
    for itself we can only afford room for two paragraph of this celebrated remonstrance  what
    have i done that wa so criminal  he exclaimed  i have wished that my order were
    wise enough to give today what will infallibly be wrested from it tomorthat it
    should receive the merit and glory of sanctioning the assemblage of the three

    or rather i have ventured to believe that the people might be in the right ah
    doubtless a patrician soiled with such a thought deserves vengeance but i am still
    guiltier than you think for it is my belief that the people which complains is
    always in the right that it indefatigable patience invariably wait the uttermost
    excess of oppression before it can determine on resisting that it never resists
    long enough to obtain complete redress and doe not sufficiently know that to strike

  text: coinage coinage lowering that of gold it may be inferred that the legislature
    were aware that the gold coin had attained the prerogative of being the standard
    of value at this time though the recommendation in sir isaac newton report wa
    carried into effect by making the guinea current at s yet it did not restore silver
    to it function a the standard of our money and this because the current value
    wa not made still lower sir isaac newton seemed aware of this himself and recommended
    that lod or d should be taken from the guinea instead of d i his however wa not
    done  and a the rate of s to the guinea the proportion of standard gold to standard
    silver at the mint wa a  to  the proportion of the market a we find by the price
    of gold and silver at this period in castaigns paper wa about d to  which constitutes
    a difference of about three per cent gold being still thus much rated above it
    value to silver and consequently not only wa no silver coined but the good and
    heavy coin were still melted for the high price they brought in the state of bullion
    it is surprising that the government having seen the operation of the principle
    recommended in the report of sir isaac newton did not carry it a little farther
    and bring the current value of the guinea to a par with the market proportion
    of the two metal and so render it the interest of the public to cany silver to
    the mint to be coined before concluding our observation upon this highly interesting
    subject we must remark that mr locke himself did not impute the high price of
    silver after the recoinage to the cause to which we have here ascribed it he attributed
    it to the permission to export silver bullion and to the prohibition of exporting
    silver coin this permission he said rendered the demand for silver bullion greater
    than the demand for silver coin dr adam smith remark upon this opinion that the
    number of people who want silver coin for the common us of buying and selling
    at home is surely much greater than that of those who want silver bullion either
    for exportation or any other purpose there subsists at present a like permission
    of exporting gold bullion and a like prohibition oi exporting gold coin and yet
    the price of gold bullion ha fallen below the mint price but in the english coin
    silver wa then in the same manner a now underrated in proportion to gold  and
    the gold coin which at that time wa not supposed to require any reformation regulated
    then a well a now the real value of the whole coin no other legislative measure
    having been taken than that which we have mentioned founded upon the report of
    sir isaac newton and the market proportion of gold to silver having seldom rendered
    it the interest of the public to coin silver this account satisfactorily for the
    degiaded state of our silver currency during the last century itecoinae in the
    year  and subsequent year we had a geneof gold in ral recoinage of our gold currency
    which form the next i prominent feature of our mint history the avowed object
    of this recoinage wa a reformation of the light and defective coin then in circulation
    and the motive for doing so wa to prevent the new and heavy coin from being selected
    from the circulation and melted for the high price which the gold brought in the
    state of bullion in fact l of the gold coin then in circulation would not weigh
    more than an ounce and by reference to the price paid by the bank for gold we
    find that this wa the market price the holder of bank note demanding new and heavy
    coin for them required the bank to have a large coinage of gold annually to supply
    this demand these coin were melted and sold in the state of bullion to the bank
    for the high price of l per ounce to remedy this inconvenience the recoinage wa
    completed and it had the effect desired for the price of gold during more than
    twenty year never exceeded but wa coinage rather under it mint price political
    economist have disagreed a to the cause of the high price of gold previously to
    the recoinage dr smith say  by issuing too great a quantity of paper of which
    the excess wa continually returning in order to be exchanged for gold and silver
    the bank of england wa for many year together obliged to coin gold to the extent
    of between eight hundred thousand and a million a year or at an average about
    eight hundred and fifty thousand pound for this great coinage the bank in consequence
    of the worn and degraded state into which the gold coin had fallen a few year
    ago wa obliged frequently to purchase bullion at the high price otl per ounce
    which it soon after issued in coin at l s  d an ounce  losing in this manner between  and  per
    cent upon the coinage of so very large a sum though the bank therefore paid no
    seignorage though the government wa properly at the expense of the coinage this
    liberality of government did not prevent altogether the expense of the bank mr
    ricardo very justly remark upon this passage that  on the principle above stated
    it appears most clear that by not reissuing the paper thus brought in the value
    of the whole currency of the degraded a well a the new gold coin would have been
    raised when all demand on the bank would have ceased or in other word the price
    of gold would have fallen to it mint pi ice mr buchanan is not of this opinion
    for he say  that the r reat expense to which the bank wa at this time exposed
    wa occasioned not a dr smith seems to imagine by any imprudent issue of paper
    but by the debased state of the currency and the consequent high price of bullion
    the bank it will be observed having no other way of procuring guinea but by sending
    bullion to the mint to be coined wa always forced to issue new coined guinea in
    exchange for it returned note and when the cunency wa generally deficient in weight
    and the price of bullion high in proportion it became profitable to draw these
    heavy guinea from the bank in exchange for it paper to convert them into bullion
    and to sell them with a profit for bank paper to be again returned to the bank
    for a new supply of guinea which were again melted and sold to this drain of specie
    the bank must always be exposed while the currency is deficient in weight a both
    an easy and a certain profit then arises from the constant interchange of paper
    for specie it may be remarked how ever that to whatever inconvenience and expense
    the bank wa then exposed by the drain of it specie it never wa imagined to be
    necessary to rescind the obligation to pay money for note at xi mr ricardo remark
    upon this passage that  mr buchanan evidently think that the whole currency must
    necessarily be brought down to the level of the value of the debased piece but
    surely by a diminution of the quantity of the currency the whole that remains
    can be elevated to the value of the best piece with this opinion of mr ricardo
    we cordially agree and it is upon this principle that a seignorage can be laid
    upon coinage without any one directly paying for it a a tax by restricting the
    quantity of a currency this seignorage may be   or even  per cent and the price
    of gold neither raised above it mint price nor the bank subjected to a run for
    guinea   during the period of these important transaction the new conconstitution
    of the mint remained without alteration ithutiono had not however escaped the
    attention of the legislature  uie  for we find that on the th of february  his

    the number of those who were sacrificed with their leader brissot but having employed
    his pen against the victorious party he fell under the invincible displeasure
    of that inhuman and bloodthirsty monster robespierre who issued a decree of accusation
    against him in july  he however found mean to effect his escape from the arrest
    and during nine month concealed himself in paris but at length dreading that the
    tyrant would order a domiciliary visit for the purpose of discovering the place
    of his retreat he passed through the barrier without being noticed and went to
    the house of a person in whom he confided on the plain of montrouge unfortunately
    for condorcet however this friend wa at that time in the metropolis and he wa
    in consei quence under the necessity of passing two dreary night in the open field
    a prey to hunger and to cold on the third day he obtained an interview with his
    friend who unhappily durst not venture to afford him shelter under his roof so
    that he wa once more compelled to wander in the field at length worn out by hunger
    and fatigue and life being no longer supportable without sustenance he applied
    at a public house for an omelette which a soon a he obtained it he devoured greedily
    his cadaverous appearance and uncommonly keen appetite roused the suspicion of
    a municipal officer who happened to be present and by whom he wa interrogated
    and the ambiguity and hesitation which characterized his answer made the officer
    conclude that it would be proper to apprehend him he wa accordingly consigned
    to a dungeon to be next day conducted to paris but his melancholy fate rendered
    such a measure unnecessary he wa found dead in the morning and a it wa generally
    understood that he constantly carried with him a dose of poison to this cause
    his vol vii con  melancholy exit wa ascribed thus terminated the cacondorcet reer
    of condorcet on the th of march  who for ii many year sustained a brilliant and
    honourable reputacondormition in the republic of letter his manner were replete  ene  with
    urbanity and he wa a well qualified to please in company a could be expected in
    a man who w r a conceived whether rightly or not to be destitute of heart la bonte
    brillait dans s yeux say grimm  et il auiait eu plus de tort qu aucun autre de
    netre pa honnete homme parce qu il aurait trompe davantage par sa physionomie
    qui annonait le qualites le plus paisibles et le plus douces his character though
    not exempt from pride wa always peaceful and obliging he appeared timid and embarrassed
    in a numerous circle but with his friend he displayed a gaiety and liveliness
    quite fascinating and never made any pretension to superiority on account of the
    great extent of his knowledge he had read a great deal and his memory wa prodigious
    soon after his death appeared his sketch of an historical draught of the progress
    of the human mind a methodical performance evincing profound research in which
    he strongly recommends his favourite idea of gradually bringing human nature to
    a state of perfection by considering what man ha been now is and may be this treatise
    will no doubt be viewed by some a rather fanciful but it is clearly the effort
    of a superior genius and must be peculiarly interesting when it is known that
    it wa composed while it author wa in circumstance of danger and distress  he idea
    of man progressive advancement towards perfection and happiness inspired him with
    consolation under his complicated misfortune although he wa an enemy to revealed
    religion he wa certainly a man of virtue and integrity yet all his philosophy
    could never inspire him with that heroic fortitude and contempt of death in a
    just cause for which the sincere votary of christianity have ever been conspicuous

  text: 's papermoney  bank numerous body of partner generally speaking they vhave
    been eminently successful an original share l of the stock of the aberdeen banking
    company established in  is now  worth no le that l their affair are uniformly
    conducted by a board of director chosen by the shareholder there are very few
    bank with le than six partner in scotland almost all the great jointstock bank
    have numerous branch so that there is hardly a town or village of any consequence
    without two or more bank the bank of scotland began to issue onepound note a early
    a  and their issue ha since been continued without interruption with only one
    exception all the scotch bank issue note  and taking their aggregate circulation
    at from l to l it is supposed that from l to l consists of note for ll in  it
    wa proposed to suppress onepound note in scotland a well a in england  but the
    measure having been strongly objected to by the people of scotland a being at
    once oppressive and unnecessary wa abandoned asons there have been very few bankruptcy
    amongst the r the few scotch bank this superior stability is to be ascribed to
    lure a var i et y  f cause s  partly to the great wealth of the early established
    bank which had a considerable influence in preventing an inferior class of bank
    acquiring any hold on the public confidence  partly to the comparatively little
    risk attending the business of banking in scotland  partly to the facility afforded
    by the scotch law for attaching a debtor property whether it consist of land or
    moveables  and partly and principally perhaps to the fact of the scotch bank being
    but indirectly and slightly affected by a depression of the exchange and an efflux
    of bullion the circumstance now mentioned render it unnecessary to enforce that
    suppression of local issue in scotland i long lotch ink ppressln of lo i note
    i scotland  s  dispensable in england where the system of itoecesev oosits provincial
    banking is of a very inferior description the risk attending the business much
    greater and where any excess in the amount of the currency necessarily occasion
    a fall of the exchange and a demand for bullion the commerce and population of
    scotland are too limited and that country is too remote from the metropolis or
    from the centre of the monied world the pivot on which the exchange turn to make
    it of importance that her currency should be identical with that of england we
    believe that the scotch attach much more importance than it deserves to the issue
    of paper and especially to the issue of onepound note  still however we do not
    think that the circumstance are at present such a to call for or warrant any attempt
    to introduce any material change in their banking system all the scotch bank receive
    deposit even of the low amount of l and allow interest on them at from one to
    two per cent below the market rate but should a deposit be unusually large a from
    l to ll a special agreement is usually made with regard to it this bank part of
    the system ha been particularly advantageous it in fact render the scotch bank
    a sort of saving bank for all class  and their readily receiving all sort of deposit
    at a reasonable rate of interest ha tended to diffuse a spirit of economy and
    parsimony among the people that would not otherwise have existed the total deposit
    in the hand of the scotch bank are believed at present  to exceed l of which fully
    a half is understood to be in sum of from l to l the scotch bank make advance
    in the way of discashaccounts and loan and on what are called cashcredits or count
    cashaccounts by the latter are meant credit given by the bank for specified sum
    to individual each of whom give a bond for the sum in his account with two or
    more individual a surety for it payment person haying such account draw upon them
    for whatever sum within their amount they have occasion for repaying these advance
    a they find opportunity but generally within short period interest is charged
    only on the average balance which may be found due to the bank the total number
    of these account in scotland in  wa estimated at about  and it may now perhaps
    be taken at about   hey are relieved to average about l  few are for le than l
    and fewer still above l it ha been contended and by no le an authority than adam
    smith that this specie of accommodation give the scotch merchant and trader a
    double command of capital  they may discount their bill of exchange say he  a
    easily a the english merchant and have besides the additional conveniency of their
    cashaccounts  but this is an obvious error the circulation will take off only
    a certain quantity of paper and to whatever extent it may be issued by mean of
    cashaccounts so much the le can be issued in the way of discount the advantage
    of a cashaccount doe not really consist in it enabling a banker to enlarge his
    advance to his customer but in the extreme facility it affords of making them
    an individual who ha obtained such an account may operate upon it at any time
    he plea and by draft for any amount an advantage he could not enjoy to any thing
    like the same extent without an infinite deal of trouble and expense were the
    loan or advance made to him through the discounting of bill the scotch bank draw

  text: aristotle jvi ical pression is a continuation of the same physical notion
    ppjsounder which bi theory of the chief good is represented xhe soul of man is
    conceived to be wrought to a temperament or mean state all it affection and action
    being in their due proportion to determine however this due measure of the affection
    or this mean to which the constitution of the soul must be brought in order to
    the virtuous character is the great question of ethic to what arbitration shall
    we resort to fix the evanescent boundary of the territory of virtue  now the instance
    in which this selfmoderation belonging to the character of virtue is observed
    become in themselves the object of approbation exciting in u sentiment of love
    esteem admiration honour and commending themselves at the same time to our intellectual
    perception hence the various expression introduced into moral philosophy of moral
    fitness propriety proportionthe decent the fair the honourable the amiable in
    conduct the adoption of one or more of which test of the morality of action ha
    given it peculiar shade of opinion to different system aristotle contemplates
    these sentiment of approbation not a they are in themselves but a they are outwardly
    evidenced by the praise of mankind at large accompanying certain action  it is
    clear that men praise some action and censure others here then is a conclusive
    evidence of the moral nature of action where mennot any particular society of
    men but the wide society of mankindare unanimous in praising any action  there
    the quality of praiseworthiness may be imputed to the action itself or the action
    is not only  good in being the attainment of some natural end but is further in
    itself the object of approbation the combination of these two effect is expressed
    by aristotle under the term zaxov  to which we have no perfect counterpart in
    our language though the word  honourable if understood in it full meaning may
    sufficiently represent it aristotle classification of action under the head of
    different virtue is founded on this analysis of the moral nature of action a distinct
    class of natural object of desire to the pursuit of which within certain limit
    praise is attached is in his system the ground of a distinct virtue his enumeration
    of the virtue is evidently incomplete it seems chiefly intended a an evidence
    by induction of that moderation of the affection in which he had stated the nature
    of virtue to consist his division indeed of virtue is physical rather than logicalan
    enumeration of the part of virtue rather than of the kind of it and his method
    accordingly did not require of him an exact statement of all the particular comprized
    under the general term virtue he ha been accused of attending chiefly to the more
    splendid virtue he wa very probably led by the very criterion of virtue which
    he employed a well a by his view of the connection between ethic and politics
    to sketch more prominently those particular virtue which recommend a man in society
    and thus he ha drawn beautiful little outline of those charm of familiar intercourseaffability
    frankness agreeableness  his introduction indeed of these quality among the virtue
    of his system is a striking evidence of the philosophy  practical nature of that
    virtue which he inculcates it is practical a virtue wdiich is not to be forgotten
    in any part of a man philosodaily life whilst it nerve his arm in danger distriph
    y  butes his bounty shield him against temptation of pleasure it unbends him in
    the hour of leisure and is ever on his tongue whether gravely pronouncing in his
    assertion and judgment or playing in the sally of his wit these very instance
    show that he did not regard splendour a the exclusive attribute of virtue on the
    contrary he expressly speaks of it a only the heightening and decoration of the
    several virtue and a meritorious because it presupposes all the virtue in their
    perfection  another evidence of his not being exclusive in his regard to the more
    showy virtue is his treating of gentleness  he selects the virtue of justice  for
    more particular discussion he distinguishes it a a particular virtue from the
    whole of virtue which it denotes reaftwiin it being the moderation of the love
    of gain or selfinterest seduced however by the example of plato he departs in
    his mode of treating this virtue from the strict province of ethic into that of
    politics the justice which he explains is a political virtue applicable to the
    citizen of a common state rather than to man a man and this confusion of ethical
    and political justice ha led him into a speculative refinement which give the
    appearance of a forced effort to reconcile the notion of justice with his theory
    of virtue looking at justice a a dispensing power he observed that it wa concerned
    about  a mean in thing themselves apportioning to each person his exact due whether
    of reward or punishment on the ground of this fact he point out that justice is
    not  a mean a the other virtue are but is  of the meannot in itself  a relative
    mean but  relative to a mean had he considered justice solely a a moral habit
    he would have seen that the distinction wa unnecessary since in this point of
    view it conforms precisely to his general notion of virtue in being a principle
    of selfmoderation there is however a foundation for the remark in the circumstance
    that justice admits of greater exactness in it exercise than other virtue  the
    rule of justice say an excellent writer   may be compared to the rule of grammar
    the rule of the other virtue to the rule which critic lay down for the attainment
    of what is sublime and elegant in composition in the other virtue we are thrown
    more on our sense of propriety in forming our practical decision in justice we
    have evident fact before usthe merit or demerit of individual in themselves and
    these form an external standard to guide u in our conduct over and above our internal
    conviction of right so far then justice may be regarded a  of the mean besides
    being also a point of propriety or a mean within ourselves aristotle it should
    be observed had no other more appropriate word distinct from  justice to express  honesty
    or  integrity and consequently wa led to generalize too far in his analysis of
    justice aristotle discussion of friendship  is open to similar objection he ha
    considered it in it outward effect a a social principle akin to justice to which
    justice is subordinate and supplementary rather than a an internal ethical principlethe

    theoretical astronomy chap i general phenomenon of the heaven sect i of the celestial
    sphere when a spectator on a clear evening directs his attention to the sky he
    perceives a concave hemisphere studded with innumerable brilliant point all which
    appear to move in parallel direction constantly preserving the same distance and
    relative position new group of star incessantly follow one another rising in the
    east mounting to a certain height and then gradually sinking till they disappear
    in the west on turning his face towards the north he observes some group of star
    which remain visible during the whole night wheeling round a certain fixed point
    and describing circle of greater or le magnitude according a they are at a greater
    or le distance from that point the same phenomenon are observed every successive
    night and a the star present always the same configuration and succeed each other
    in the same order the mind is irresistibly led to the hypothesis of the diurnal
    revolution of the whole heaven about a fixed axis this hypothesis implies that
    the star move in parallel plane and that their mutual distance remain invariable
    in order however to be assured that such is the case it is necessary to have recourse
    to more accurate observation and to refer their successive position to something
    that is fixedto certain point or plane which do not participate in the general
    motion horizon what is most obviously adapted for this purpose is the horizon
    or the plane which appears extended all round u and bounded by a circle of which
    the eye of the spectator occupies the centre let the circle senw fig plate  represent
    the horizon c being the centre or place of lxxix the observer suppose now that
    a star is observed to rise eigl a t a certain point of the horizon a and after
    tracing it circuit in the sky to set at the point a suppose also that another
    star rise at b and set at b then if the distance ab ab are measured by mean of
    some angular instrument it will be found that ab is equal to ab and that this
    is the case with regard to any two star whatever since therefore the arc ab and
    ab are equal it follows that the chord a a b b joining their extremity are parallel
    whence we infer that if two star rise successively at the same point of the horizon
    a they will also set at the same point a a circumstance which is of itself strikingly
    indicative of the uniformity of the motion of the celestial body through c let
    a perpendicular be drawn to the chord cardinal a a meeting the boundary of the
    horizon in s and n point these two point are the south and north point of the
    horizon  and another straight line drawn through c parallel to a a will meet the
    horizon in e and w the east and west point the four together namely s e n w are
    called the four cardinal point of the horizon the horizontal circle is itself
    denominated the azimuth cirazimuth cle azimuth distance are measured from the
    north and south point so that s a is the azimuth distance of a star rising at
    a and s a is that of it setting at a the complement of the azimuth or it defect
    from a right angle is called the amplitude which is consequently meaamplisured
    from the east and west point thus the arc eatude is the amplitude of a star rising
    at a or it ortive amplitude and wa is that of it setting or it occasive amplitude
    conceive a straight line to pas through c perpendicular to the horizon this line
    which is called the vertical will meet the visible hemisphere in a point directly
    above the observer which is denominated the zenith the zenith point diametrically
    opposite in which the prolongation of  the vertical meet the invisible hemisphere
    is the nadir nadir the plane determined by the vertical and the straight line
    n is called the meridian because when the sunmendar reach it he is equally distant
    from the point at which he rise and set or it is midday the great circle formed

    circle it divide the sphere into the eastern and western hemisphere any circle

    say  there are uncommon strain of eloquence in it and i wa surprised to find not
    one single idiom of his country i think in the whole work mr hume in a letter
    to the author dated th march  congratulates him on the success of the book adding
    that he had  met with nobody that had read it who did not praise it lord mansfield
    is very loud to that purpose in his sunday society i heard lord chesterfield and
    lord lyttleton express the same sentiment and what is above all caddel i am told
    is already projecting a second edition of the same quarto size mr hume then informs
    him that lord shelburne and lord bute were amongst his most zealous partisan the
    last declaring the book one of the best he had ever read charles townshend appears
    to have been of the same opinion a he read it five time general clerk had pressed
    the author to dedicate his work to lord shelburne who had signified his intention
    of offering mr ferguson the government of west florida  upon which occasion his
    lordship laughed very heartily when the general expressed his conviction that
    mr ferguson wa more usefully employed a a teacher of science the book however
    appeared without any dedication in the course of the following year lord shelburne
    intimated a hope of getting mr ferguson established with a proper appointment
    at oxford  and some other person of influence meditated a design of employing
    him in one of the department of state this purpose wa frustrated in all probability
    by a temper which did not permit him to accommodate himself to the view of those
    whose maxim of conduct he did not entirely approve another circumstance may be
    considered a having also operated to obstruct the fulfilment of the scheme which
    were devised for his advancement at this time he married miss burnet a young lady
    nearly connected with his mother family and still more nearly related to his intimate
    friend dr black soon afterwards he began to cultivate a farm in the parish of
    currie and at a considerable sacrifice of private interest gratified his taste
    for improvement by transforming a barren heath into a scene which became distinguished
    for beauty and fertility it wa impossible however for any combination of circumstance
    to abate his literary activity and he not only continued to conduct the business
    of his class with unremitted diligence but seized every interval of leisure which
    he could command to collect material for a history of the roman commonwealth whilst
    he wa proceeding in his research he wa solicited by philip earl of stanhope the
    editor of dr robert simsons posthumous work and the other guardian of charles
    earl of chesterfield to superintend the education of that young nobleman then
    in his nineteenth year the negotiation wa conducted through the mediation of dr
    adam smith who judging the offer to be advantageous to his friend exerted himself
    with great earnestness to induce him to accept it lord stanhope wa extremely anxious
    to obtain the able service of dr ferguson without delay a he conceived it to be
    of the utmost consequence to his young kinsman to be placed under the care of  a
    person so well qualified to complete the remaining part of his education and to
    repair the neglect omission and error which had unfortunately been committed in
    the former part of it the proposal had originally been made early in the year  and
    wa renewed in december soon after the commencement of the session of the college
    when dr ferguson wa engaged not only in teaching his own class but also in lecturing
    on natural philosophy the professorship of which had recently become vacant by
    the death of his relation mr russell fie wa not able to prevail on the patronsfw
    to accept of a substitute to complete the labour of that session  but after obtaining
    leave of absence for the next session he joined his young charge at geneva in
    may  and at first entertained hope that his labour might prove beneficial the
    connection however wa not so agreeable a he expected and it terminated about twelve
    month afterwards in the mean time he had very nearly been deprived of his office
    in the university the towncouncil had at his desire appointed mr john bruce then
    assistant and afterwards successor to mr stevenson to teach the moral philosophy
    during the session  but before the conclusion of the session they thought fit
    to rescind this act and to declare the office vacant his friend in the university
    particularly drs robertson blair and black were exceedingly indignant at this
    proceeding more especially a sir john pringle had been permitted to be several
    year absent and at that very time the professor of mathematics and of the theory
    of medicine had both been allowed to discharge their duty by substitute for two
    year without challenge or complaint a the council however seemed to have determined
    to fill up the place by a new election it became necessary for his friend to apply
    to the court of session to put a stop to their proceeding  i have been much obliged
    say he in a letter to a friend  to the general voice that wa raised in my favour
    a well a to the ardent zeal of particular friend hay campbell afterwards lord
    president ha given me proof of friendship which i can never forget pulteney ha
    behaved to me in every thing a he would have done at the beginning of the poker
    club i have always been an advocate for mankind and am a more determined one than
    ever the fool and knave are no more than necessary to give others something to
    do after his return he continued a formerly to divide his time between his literary
    and agricultural pursuit and engaged occasionally in the political controversy
    which agitated the country during the progress of the american war besides his
    pamphlet in answer to dr price observation on liberty he communicated his view
    from time to time to sir william pulteney and other member of parliament and when
    it wa resolved by government to send out commissioner to quiet the disorder in
    the colony he wa appointed secretary to the commission it appears from a letter
    of general putnam dated july  that the nomination of dr ferguson wa very agreeable
    to the more intelligent part of the american who not without reason were dissatisfied
    to find that the commissioner were fettered by restriction which rendered their
    appointment nugatory  i am very sorry he writes  that the parliament of great
    britain is still so blind to their own and our interest a to send dr ferguson
    and the rest of the worthy gentleman over to america with limited power and that
    to last only till july  and then to be revoked by them it they think fit by which
    mean i am deprived of seeing your friend dr ferguson which give me great pain
    a  always have heard of his being a gentleman of the first character lor learning
    good sense and humanity it is well known that the commissioner returned without
    accomplishing the object of their mission but they had an opportunity of acquiring
    more useful information of the state and temper of the country than government
    had received m a the previous course of the contest whilst dr ferguson wa absent
    during the session  his place wassupplied by mr dugald stewart who about five
    year alterwards wa destined to succeed him in the chair of mora philosophy in

    manufacturer of sheffield at twopence halfpenny a pound and the latter at the
    rate of two for three halfpenny here a well a in other part of the country the
    poor it is stated received the fish distributed among them at low price with the
    liveliest gratitude  and one gentleman in worcestershire state that  the herring
    in particular have proved a bonus to the poor of the most essential benefit we
    sold them he say  at a very low and reasonable rate on account of the extreme
    indigence of the purchaser  and they have produced lao profit which after the
    expense of carriage is paid will be laid out in employing the poor in repairing
    the road it deserves to be mentioned a an instance of the certainty of a supply
    to answer the demand that when the association wa formed in  the north sea and
    iceland fishery had for some time entirely ceased but on the committee offering
    the fisherman l a ton for all the fish they should catch and cure they supplied
    in the first instance  ton of drysalted and fifty ton of fresh cod in the second  ton
    of drysalted and  ton of fresh  in the third  ton of drysalted and  ton of fresh
    in all  ton of fish w ere taken and brought to market in consequence of this offer
    not a fish of which would otherwise have been caught the obvious policy then to
    be pursued for extending the british fishery is by creating an extended and constant
    demand in the foreign market this can only be done by the care and attention bestowed
    in curing the fish so that in point of quality it may compete with those of the
    dutch and other nation of the continent a point which we have just now happily
    attained  but in the supply for home consumption every thing almost yet remains
    to be done the fish association have however clearly shown the way of proceeding
    to obtain this desirable end they have proved that not only in the metropolis
    but in the interior of the country the poor have none of those prejudice which
    were ascribed to them against the use of fish when it is fresh and sweet and when
    they are able to procure it at a moderate price a free circulation by mean of
    market established in the metropolis and at all the fishing port might effect
    this to a certain degree but in addition to these some artificial expedient might
    be advisable for a time at least to raise and keep steady the demand it is much
    to be regretted that queen elizabeth who wa well aware of the importance of the
    fishery in a political a well a economical point of view did not in regulating
    the church ritual ordain two day in every week to be set apart by protestant a
    fish day which would have created a steady and permanent demand for fresh and
    salted fish in every part of the united kingdom such an ordinance might in her
    reign have been enforced and long habit would have reconciled people to the observance
    of those day in our time but it would be in  f sively placed the monopoly of fish
    in the hand of a few interested salesman the establishment of that splendid and
    most commodious market the hungerford ha put an end to that injurious monopoly
    and consequently reduced the price and increased the quantity of this specie of
    food for the use of the metropolis the encouragement given by the government in
    the shape of bounty appears to have contributed but little to the success of the
    fishery if a branch of trade once fairly established will not support itself without
    being bolstered up by bounty it never can be worth carrying on bounty should only
    be continued for a definite time and decreased gradually those on the fishery
    should be given on the quantity procured and the quality of those cured and not
    on the instrument of their production  on the fish and not on the vessel it wa
    proved by a committee of the house of common in  that the herring fishery absolutely
    cost little short of l annually which on an average of ten year wa equal to l
    per cent on the value of all the fish that had been taken by the vessel on which
    it wa paid adam smith ha justly observed that a tonnagebounty proportioned to
    the burden of the ship and not to her diligence and success in the fishery is
    not the best stimulus to exertion  it wa an encouragement for fitting out ship
    to catch not the fish but the bounty  or to induce rash adventurer to engage in
    concern which they did not understand and cause them to lose by their ignorance
    more than wa gained by the liberality of government the carelessness of such person
    and the ignorance of those employed by them in curing and packing the fish not
    only robbed the public purse but destroyed the character of the article in the
    foreign market where if saleable at all it fetched only an inferior price whilst
    the skill and attention of the dutch secured for their fish that preference to
    which they were justly entitled the change of the bounty however from the tonnage
    to the quantity and the quality of the fish caught and cured with the regulation
    adopted by the act of th and th geo iii have had the good effect of raising the
    character and consequently increasing the demand for british fish in the foieign
    market where the herring in particular are now held in equal estimation with those
    ot the dutch the bounty granted by the act  geo iii c  is s per barrel on all
    herring branded by the proper officer and s a barrel granted by the act  geo iii
    c  and is so considerable that at this time it amount to a sum not le than l a
    year it would appear however that all which is now wanting for the encouragement
    and extension of the british fishery is a constant steady and increased demand
    in the home and foreign market an experiment made by mr hale one of the member
    of the committee for the relief of the manufacturing poor prof decisively how
    easy it would be to introduce the general use of fish in the metropolis he agreed
    with some fisherman to take from ten to twenty thousand mackerel a day at a price
    not exceeding s the hundred of six score or at a penny a piece a price at which
    the fisherman said they could afford to supply the london jnarket to any extent

    celebrity and so peculiarly a benefactor to this publication a would have made
    it nt that some memorial of him should be preserved in these page even if it could
    have been surmised that it might not have been found in any other place there
    are few name however in the recent history of british science that are more extensively
    or advantageously known or of which the lew particular that remain to be recorded
    will be more generally interesting his life like most others that have been dedicated
    to the silent pursuit of learning and science doe not abound in incident or adventure  but
    it is tull of honour both for the individual and the study to which he wa devoted
    and may be read with more profit than many more ambitious history  he wa the eldest
    son of the reverend james  layiair minister of benvie in forfarshire in which
    place he wa born on the th of march  tie resided at home under the domestic tuition
    of his father until the age of fourteen when he entered at the university of st
    andrew and wa almost immediately distinguished not merely for his singular proficiency
    in mathematical learning but for the extent of his general knowledge the clearness
    of his judgment and the dignity and propriety of his conduct a remarkable testimony
    to this effect ha been made public in an early letter of principal george hill
    who wa at this time one of his fellowstudents and wa himself so remarkable for
    early talent that we find it recorded of him that he had privately composed an
    excellent sermon in the tenth year of his age a youth of this description cannot
    be supposed to have been very indulgent in his estimate of the merit of his competitor  and
    it could therefore have been no ordinary measure of ability that called forth
    the following ingenuous avowal in a confidential letter to his mother   playfair
    ha very great merit and more knowledge and a better judgment than any of his classfellows
    i make no exception  my part might be more showy and the kind of reading to which
    my inclination led me wa calculated to enable me to make a better figure at st
    andrew but in judgment and understanding i wa greatly inferior to him  it isscarcely
    a stronger though undoubtedly a very different proof of his rare attainment that
    when the professor of natural philosophy wilkie the once celebrated author of
    the epigoniad w r a prevented by indisposition from delivering the regular lecture
    he used generally to delegate the task of instruction to his youthful pupil wilkie
    besides being a scholar and philosopher of no mean note wa a man of primitive
    benevolence and integrity and of great vivacity in conversation and the friendship
    which in spite of the disparity of their year wa speedily formed between him and
    young playfair speaks a much for the social and moral character of the latter
    a his substitution of him in the classroom doe for his early proficiency in science
    on this last subject we shall mention but one fact more in  when only eighteen
    year of age he offered himself with the approbation of his instructor at st andrew
    a candidate for the professorship of mathematics in mareschal college aberdeen
    and sustained with the most distinguished credit an examination or comparative
    trial which lasted eleven day and embraced nearly the whole range of the exact
    science out of the six competitor who entered the list against him two only were
    judged to have excelled him the reverend dr trail who wa appointed to the office
    and dr hamilton who afterwards succeeded to and long filled it with much reputation
    in  he removed to edinburgh where his merit and modesty very soon introduced him
    to the friendship of dr robertson adam smith dr matthew stewart dr black and dr
    hutton  with all of whom he continued on term playfair of the utmost cordiality
    during the whole period of their life in  he wa a candidate for the professorship
    of natural philosophy at st andrew vacant by the death of his friend dr wilkie
    there wa no comparative trial on this occasion  and he wa again unsuccessful under
    circumstance which have led one of the most dutiful son of that university dr
    cook in his life of principal hill to remark  how much it suffered in thus losing
    a man by whose talent it reputation would have been so highly promoted in the
    course of the same year the death of his father suddenly devolved upon him the
    burden of supporting the family and admonished him no longer to delay the final
    election of a profession he had been educated with a view to the church and wa
    every way qualified to accept a living on the establishment but his decided predilection
    for science had hitherto made him hesitate about engaging in a vocation the duty
    of which he felt if conscientiously discharged would necessarily interfere to
    a great extent with the study he wa loth to abandon in this emergency however
    he thought himself no longer entitled to indulge in those predilection and accordingly
    made application to lord gray the patron for a presentation to the living of liff
    and benvie which had been filled by his father his lordship wa too well aware
    of his merit to hesitate about conferring so great a benefit on the parishioner
    and immediately issued a presentation in his favour although from some challenge
    of his right to the patronage induction wa not obtained until late in the year  from
    this period until  mr playfair w r a constantly resident at liff and occupied
    almost exclusively with the pastoral duty of his office in this retreat his leisure
    hour were dedicated to the education of his younger brother and to a very close
    and intimate correspondence with mr robertson afterwards lord robertson the son
    of the illustrious historian to whom he seems to have confined the remark that
    occurred to him upon the different author he perused and the subject of speculation
    which they suggested we cannot help hoping that some selection from this correspondence
    may one day be given to the public in the year  he contributed to the transaction
    of the royal society of london a paper on the arithmetic of impossible quantity
    which exhibit within a very small compass a striking example of the rare and admirable
    talent of detaching the sound spirit of science from what may be termed it mysticism
    and circumscribing by the most precise and luminous boundary the vague and unlimited
    inquiry into which many mathematician had been seduced by the nature of the instrument
    they employed in the year  he wa induced by very advantageous offer to resign
    his charge and to superintend the education of mr ferguson of raith and his brother
    sir ronald an arrangement which restored him in a great measure to the literary
    and scientific society of edinburgh and enabled him to gratify himself by a personal
    introduction to several of the most eminent cultivator of science in london he
    had repeatedly visited dr maskelyne astronomer royal whilst that ingenious mathematician
    wa busied in  in making a series of observation in perthshire on the attraction
    of mountain andwhilstsharingthe shelter of his tent on the side of schehallien
    contracted with him a cordial friendship which continued unbroken for the remainder
    of their life under these honourable auspex he made his first appearance in london

    semiprivate kind have been formed chiefly in the western part of the town for
    the instruction of the child of both sex of the higher class the number of elementary

    a population of  at  and under  year of age and  at  and under  year of age these
    figure however do not express the precise educational destitution the number between  and  year
    of age being estimated at about  or   and although the number in this last category
    ha of late year been gradually reducing through the increased zeal of ecclesiastical
    educationalist a well a the benevolence of general philanthropist still there
    is left a wide field of ignorance to cultivate and which it is feared can only
    be reclaimed by some governmental and unsectarian system of tuition one of the
    most striking fact connected with the educational statistic of glasgow is that
    in  there were  sabbath school which were attended by  young person although glasgow
    can boast of having had many learned and able men at various time born or resident
    within it border still it inhabitant cannot lay claim to having much of a literary
    character about the middle of last century a literary society wa established consisting
    chiefly of the professor and clergy of the city and neighbourhood and reckoned
    amongst it distinguished member professor simson adam smith traill reid john millar
    and the messrs foulis the celebrated printer another literary and commercial society
    wa also formed about the beginning of the present century in which drs chalmers
    and wardlaw and other able men took an interest and where essay are still read
    and discussion take place on the literary commercial statistical and political
    topic of the day a philosophical society wa also established in  which uniting
    a it now doe the man of science with the practical chemist and mechanic form a
    most effective nucleus for mutual encouragement and advancement in  a society
    for promoting astronomy wa formed which in due time erected an observatory at
    first placed on garnethill which wa thereafter removed to a rising ground about
    two mile west of the city where it now stand it is occupied and conducted by the
    professor of astronomy in the university in addition to an antiquarian society

    society and also to those founded by mr stirling and established under the title
    of the glasgow public library in consequence of an invitation from the magistrate
    letterpress george anderson wa induced to come to glasgow in  printing and here
    printed an account of the celebrated assembly of the church of scotland which
    met in that year the printing of book however doe not appear to have succeeded
    well until the messrs foulis commenced in  after which and during a succession
    of year they sent forth from their press work and particularly edition of the
    classic which for accuracy and beauty have never been surpassed in great britain

  text: a g r agrarian agrarian law leges agrarice when used in the most extended
    signification of the term are law for the distribution and regulation of property
    in land the history of these enactment is not only important a explanatory of
    the constitution of the ancient republic but is rendered highly interesting by
    the conflicting opinion which have been entertained respecting their object and
    operation it seems to have been a notion generally entertained in the ancient
    world that every citizen of a country should be a landholder and that the territory
    of a state so far a it wa not left uninclosed or reserved for public purpose should
    be divided in equal portion among the citizen such a distribution of public land
    seems to have been acted upon a a recognised principle from the earliest period
    to which existing historical record extend hence we find the almighty giving express
    instruction to moses a to the manner in which the land of canaan wa to be portioned
    out among the hebrew num xxxiii  and naming the person to whom the division wa
    to be entrusted num xxxiv  a division of the land wa accordingly made and the
    portion assigned to each man became his inalienable property and descended in
    perpetuity to his heir and successor by the law of jubilee all land were re stored
    free from encumbrance on the recurrence of the  year of releaseso that though
    a man estate might in the interval have been repeatedly sold or alienated yet
    on the return of the fiftieth year it reverted to the heir of the original possessor
    levit xxv  in the republic of ancient greece and also in the grecian colony a
    similar principle of division of land prevailed thuc v  herod iv  lycurgus is
    represented by plutarch lycur a redividing the whole territory of laconia into  parcel
    of which  were assigned in equal lot to a many spartan family and  also in equal
    lot to their free subject  and although this statement is not borne out by any
    of the early greek historian and is even inconsistent with the assertion of aristotle
    polit ii  yet it is valuable a recognising the principle of the division of the
    public land see thirlwalls hist of greece chap viii and grotes hist of greece
    part ii chap vi with the authority there quoted it wa long a prevalent and undisputed
    opinion that the territory of the hebrew and of the republic of ancient greece
    were divided into equal portion and that the object of such a distribution wa
    to maintain a state of equality among all the member of the community this however
    doe not appear to be consistent with the distinction of rank which we find admitted
    in scripture josh ix   xxii   sam ix  c c and from a remark of thucydides i  taken
    in connection with the statement of aristotle polit ii  it may be legitimately
    inferred that property did not continue to be equally distributed at lacedaemon
    distinction of rank are clearly recognised in the legislation of solon aristotle
    in the second book of his politics chap vi c explains the constitution of several
    of the ancient republic and endeavour to show how the population is to be accommodated
    to this equal division of land but it would be foreign to our object to review
    his argument it may be sufficient to remark that such an attempt to arrest the
    progress of enterprise is altogether inconsistent with the spirit of liberty which
    gave life and energy to the ancient republic  and that though it might have been
    carried into effect under the despotism of persia or the predominant rule of the
    king of macedonia it wa entirely at variance with the freedom of opinion which
    prevailed in greece and the stubborn resistance to control which animated the
    roman after the expulsion of the king but granting that such a policy had been
    practicable it would have been highly inexpedient the ignorant hindoo might remain
    satisfied with the class which nature had transmita g r  ted to him through successive
    generation because his proagrarian genitor had been prevented from emerging from
    their ob scurity but the citizen of greece and italy being themselves constituent
    member of the body politic and not ignorant of the power thereby conferred on
    them could not have been kept in check by the same principle of fear such an attempt
    moreover to prevent the acquisition of property would have obstructed the advancement
    of the art of civilised life would have extinguished those feeling of patriotism
    which led the greek so often to hazard their life in defence of their country
    and by engendering discontent and exciting internal commotion would have made
    them an easy prey to their enemy the expression agrarian law however is more commonly
    applied to the enactment among the roman for the management of the public domain
    ager publicus  and to an account of these the remainder of our space must be devoted
    it is a singular fact that while almost every other subject connected with the
    roman constitution had been successfully investigated and explained the object
    and intention of the agrarian law were entirely misunderstood by scholar for many
    century after the revival of letter they were invariably represented a intended
    to prohibit roman citizen from holding property in land above a certain fixed
    amount and a authorising the division among the poorer citizen of the estate of
    private individual when these exceeded the prescribed limit thus legalising a
    system of plunder which would have been subversive of all social order no such
    doctrine had indeed been admitted in any wellregulated state ancient or modern  nor
    did anything analogous to it appear in the principle or practice of the roman
    constitution  yet the expression used by the ancient author in reference to these
    enactment and the disturbance to which they invariably gave rise seemed to justify
    an unfavourable interpretation  and the opinion when once propounded wa unconditionally
    received by successive generation of learned men notwithstanding the many embarrassment
    and contradiction to which it led romulus is represented a dividing his small
    territory among the member of his infant community at the rate of two jug era
    each extending to twothirds of an english acre apiece a inheritable property the
    whole district however wa not thus assigned one portion wa set apart for the service
    of the god and for the royal domain and another wa reserved a common land for
    pasture the stock kept on the common land served to eke out a maintenance which
    two jugera could not otherwise have furnished to a family and an agistment wa
    paid to the commonwealth for the pasturage it is probable that the same principle
    prevailed under the regal government and that successive adjustment of the territory
    were made such a law existed among those of servius tullius the equality of property
    thus established seems to have been considered a a fundamental principle of the
    roman constitution and the agrarian law were regarded a the necessary mean of
    wresting from the large proprietor the possession which they had illegally acquired
    machiavelli and montesquieu both participate in this mistake and are far from
    condemning the agrarian law even when taken in the common meaning the former alleges
    that the interest of every republic requires that the state should be rich and
    the citizen poor and thus justifies the assumed spoliation while montesquieu receives
    it a an historical fact that romulus adopted the principle of equality in his
    original distribution of the territory of rome a the future ground of her strength  and
    that the tribunitian contest were but attempt to restore the original constitution

    signifying money and of all it derivative would seem to prove that cattle pecus
    had been the primitive money of the roman  and that they had been used a such
    by the ancient german is obvious  for their law uniformly fix the amount of the
    penalty to be paid for offence in cattle  in remoter age corn wa very generally
    used in agricultural country a money and even now nothing is more common than
    to stipulate for corn rent and wage other article have been used in other country

    on the shore of the maidive island are used in smaller payment throughout hindostan
    and form the only money of extensive district in africa  dried fish serf a money
    in iceland and newfoundland   and adam smith mention that at the period of the
    publication of the wealth of nation  it wa customary in a village in scotland
    for workman to carry nail a money to the baker shop and the alehouse  defect of
    j u  these article universally want some of the prinmodities   p ro p eres which
    money ought to posse product must frequently be brought to market which are worth
    only part of an ox and part of a skin  but a an ox could not be divided and a
    the division of a skin would most probably deprive it of part of it value they
    could not be exchanged for such money divisibility is not however the only indispensable
    quality in a commodity used a a medium of exchange it is farther necessary that
    it should admit of being kept for an indefinite period without deteriorating  that
    it should by possessing great value in small bulk be easily carried about and
    that one piece of money of a certain weight and fineness should be precisely equivalent
    to every other piece of money of the same weight and fineness but none of the
    commodity specified above a having been used a money posse these property though
    cattle had been sufficiently divisible they could neither be preserved nor transported
    from place to place without a great deal of trouble and expense while owing to
    the difference in their quality one ox of a superior might be worth two or three
    ox of an inferior variety it is plain therefore that they could not serve a money
    except in a very rude state of society when the art were almost unknown and the
    rearing of cattle formed the principal employment corn is sufficiently divisible  but
    it bulk is far too great in proportion to it value to admit of it easy transportation
    and it also is of very different and not easily appreciated quality salt shell
    and fish are all open to insuperable objection equal quantity of all of them differ
    very greatly in their value  some of them cannot be divided and others cannot
    be preserved or transported without much loss these commodity were also deficient
    in a still more important particular their value wa not sufficiently money invariable
    to permit of their being advantageously used a money they were not durable or
    lasting nor wa it possible to adjust their supply so a to avoid sudden fluctuation
    of price the occasional abundance and scarcity of pasture ha a powerful influence
    over the price of cattle which is still more seriously affected by the occurrence
    of epidemical disease and other contingency the fluctuation in the price of corn
    arising from variation of the season are too frequent and obvious to require to
    be pointed out and in the island where cowry are picked up a strong gale from
    a particular point of the compass ha frequently in a few hour sunk their value
    considerably it wa not therefore to be expected that such commodity should be
    either generally or permanently used a money in civilised society party would
    very frequently be unwilling to buy or barter produce for article which might
    in a few week or even day lose a third or a half of their value the desire of
    uniting the different quality of invarigold and ability of value divisibility
    durability facility of transsilver the portation and perfect sameness doubtless
    formed the fittest ipairresistible reason which have induced all civilised community
    to employ gold and silver a money though far from invariable the value of these
    metal change only by slow degree they are readily divisible into any number of
    part which may be reunited by mean of fusion without loss they do not deteriorate
    by being kept their firm and compact texture make them difficult to wear their
    cost of production especially of gold is so considerable that they posse great
    value in small bulk and can of course be transported with comparative facility
    and their identity is perfect the pure gold and silver supplied by russia and
    australia having precisely the same quality with that furnished by california
    and peru no wonder therefore when almost every property necessary to constitute
    money is possessed in so eminent a degree by the precious metal that they have
    been used a such from a very remote tera their employment in this function is
    not ascribable to accident to the genius of any individual or to any peculiar
    combination of circumstance it grew naturally out of the want and necessity of
    society on the one hand and the mean of supplying them possessed by these metal
    on the other they became universal money a turgot ha observed  not in consequence
    of any arbitrary agreement among men or of the intervention of any law but by
    the nature and force of thing terials for money a considerable period must necessarily
    have elapsed i ntr j uc  after the introduction of the precious metal into comtion

    a state of nature nothing can be unjust the notion of right and wrong justice
    and injustice have there noplace where there is no common power there is no lawwhere
    no law no transgression   no law can be unjust  many similar statement might be
    adduced from the two work from which these sentence are taken and such statement
    it cannot be denied if taken by themselves would fully justify the imputation
    to hobbes of the opinion that it is by the authority of political enactment that
    justice and injustice right and wrong are produced all however that he appears
    to have intended by them is that in a state the governing power must settle the
    condition of property and by it enactment and not by the opinion of each individual
    must the duty and the right of each a a member of the body politic be determined
    that he did not consider his inquiry a directed to the settling of general principle
    of moral but only to the determining of the authority by which in a state the
    boundary of good and evil should for governmental purpose be fixed and that he
    held moral distinction to be in themselves independent of civil enactment may
    be clearly shown from many part of his treatise de give thus in reference to theft
    he say  non queerimus an furtum sit peccatum  quccrimus quid furtum dicendum sit
    et sic de cuteris similibus  according to this his design is not to determine
    the moral virtue but only to ascertain by what authority such and such act are
    to be held breach of these virtue this obviously implies that these virtue themselves
    rest on something else than and anterior to civil enactment for their basis still
    more explicitly and fully is this stated in the following passage  doctrinarum
    quae ad seditionem disponunt una et prima haec est cognitionem de bono et malo
    pertinere ad singulos in statu quidem natural ubi jure aequali singuli vivunt
    nec se per pacta sua aliorum imperio submiserunt veram earn esse concedimus imo
    cap i art  probavimus sed in statu civili falsa est ostensum enim est cap yi art  regulas
    boni et mali justi et injusti honesti et inhonesti esse leges civiles ideoque
    quod legislator praeceperit id pro bono quod vetuerit et pro malo habendum esse  here
    the author distinctly state that in a state of nature every man can and may judge
    for himself what is right or wrong and that it is only when he ha entered into
    a civil compact that he becomes bound to allow the state to fix the rule of rectitude
    for him such a doctiine may be very unsound politically but it doe not amount
    to anything like an affirmation that moral distinction a such have their origin
    in civil enactment on the contrary in that part of his work to which he here refers
    the first chapter hobbes show at length that there are natural law prescribing
    to man what he ought to do that these law are immutable and eternal that they
    bind man inforo rectitude conscientice that they are nothing else than certain
    conelusions understood by reason concerning thing to be done and thing to be omitted
    that they are identical with the moral law  and that they may justly be called
    divine  not only because reason which is itself the law of nature ha been given
    immediately by god to each man a the rule of his action but also because the precept
    of living thence derived are the same a those which have been promulgated by the
    divine majesty a law of the heavenly kingdom through our lord jesus christ and
    the holy prophet and apostle  these sentiment appear altogether incompatible with
    the theory of moral distinction usually imputed to hobbes it belongs to another
    department to examine the soundness of hobbes doctrine concerning the relation
    of subject to their governor the opinion which ha been thus injuriously imputed
    to hobbes wa certainly however held by some ancient philosopher a cudworth ha
    showed in his learned way by numerous citation  unfortunately these are for the
    most part given in such a way that we have been unable to verify them all and
    of those we have succeeded in tracing all do not appear apposite to the purpose
    for which they are cited when every deduction however ha been made on these account
    there still remains enough to prove that there were philosopher in ancient time
    who not only affirmed what hobbes ha affirmed a to justice and injustice good
    and evil being determined by law but who affirmed also what hobbes ha denied viz
    that such distinction are not also by nature  now to all such doctrine the answer
    is sufficiently obvious a law a law is the mere expression of the supreme will
    in a community and can never confer a moral character on any act to which it relates
    the utmost law can do is to indicate that a given course will be followed by a
    given punishment and so to affix a character of imprudence or folly to the pursuing
    of that course it can never per se make that which wa before right to become wrong
    nor that which wa before wrong to become right  a sovereign a ha been truly said  may
    enact and rescind law but he cannot create or rescind a single virtue nor can
    any mere expression of his will or any penalty he may attach to the violation
    of it awaken one feeling of remorse or selfcondemnation in the bosom of the man
    who transgresses the law under a clear and firm conviction that it enjoins what
    a regard to a higher lawthe law of rectitude or of godforbids the mere utterance
    of will can never of itself add moral quality to an act or bring one under an
    obligation to perform it and it matter not whether this will be that of an individual
    or of a community for mere number in a case of this sort go for nothing where
    x   a or a amount to no more a dr brown put it though he erroneously ascribes
    this argument to cudworth  it must either be right to obey the law and wrong to
    disobey it or indifferent whether we obey it or not if it be morally indifferent
    whether we obey it or not the law which may or may not be obeyed with equal virtue
    cannot be a source of virtue and if it be right to obey it the very supposition
    that it is right to obey it implies a notion of right and wrong that is antecedent
    to the law and give it it moral efficacy  it is not easy to conceive what could

    to have been the principal cause of dr black s haying suddenly stopped short in

    probable however that the calm and unambitious temper which seems to have formed
    a striking feature of his character and which a le friendly hand than his learned
    biographer might have set down a nearly allied to indolence checked the ardour
    and perseverance which were necessary to excite and carry him forward in the path
    of research and discovery whatever may have been the cause it is to be regretted
    that dr black so conspicuous for his patient judicious and elegant mode of investigation
    and so distinguished for the simplicity perspicuity and precision of his reasoning
    and deduction should have contributed so little in rearing the noble superstructure
    of chemical science the foundation of which he had been the mean of establishing
    on a firm and solid basis the theory of the nature of quicklime and the cause
    of it causticity soon became known to the german chemist and from them it met
    with strong opposition various mysterious doctrine at this time prevailed in the
    german school concerning the peculiar nature of fire  and a the notion there entertained
    of the causticity of alkaline substance involved some of these doctrine a great
    many objection were started to a theory which threatened to overthrow long established
    and favourite opinion the most formidable opponent of the new theory wa professor
    meyer of osnaburg all the phenomenon of the causticity and mildness of lime and
    alkali were according to his explanation to be accounted for by the action of
    a substance of a peculiar nature to which he gave the name of acidum pingue this
    substance which wa supposed to be formed in the lime during calcination consisted
    of an igneous matter in a certain state of combination with other substance it
    is a matter of some surprise that dr black should have experienced any uneasiness
    on account of the opposition made to this discovery on mere hypothesis unsupported
    by fact or even by plausible argument when his own doctrine had been fully and
    irrefragably established by the test of decisive experiment nor is it le surprising
    that in the course of his lecture for several year he should have taken great
    pain in refuting the argument and in combating the objection of meyer dr black
    reception at the university of glasgow wa highly flattering and encouraging a
    a student he had not only done himself much credit by his successful progress
    in the different pursuit in which he wa engaged but he had also during his residence
    there conciliated in a high degree the attachment and affection of the professor
    when he returned a a professor he immediately became connected in the strictest
    friendship with dr black adam smith then professor of moral philosophy in that
    i r jose  h university and the friendship thus commenced grew stronger and stronger
    and wa never interrupted throughout the whole of their life a simplicity and sensibility
    an incorruptible integrity the strictest delicacy and singular correctness of
    manner marked the character of each of these philosopher and firmly bound them
    together in the closest union at glasgow dr black soon acquired great reputation
    a a professor and became a favourite physician in that large and active city his
    engaging countenance his agreeable and attractive manner free from all studied
    endeavour to please and the kind concern he took in the case intrusted to his
    care made him a most welcome visitor in every family it wa between the year  and  that
    he brought to maturity his speculation concerning heat which had occupied his
    attention at interval from the very first dawn of his philosophical investigation
    his discovery in this department of science were by far the most important of
    all that he made and perhaps indeed among the most valuable which appeared during
    the busy period of the eighteenth century to enter fully into the nature of his
    investigation would be improper in this place  but the sum of them all wa usually
    expressed by him in the following proposition when a solid body is converted into
    a fluid there enters into it and unites with it a quantity of heat the presence
    of which is not indicated by the thermometer and this combination is the cause
    of the fluidity which the body assumes on the other hand when a fluid body is
    converted into a solid a quantity of heat separate from it the presence of which
    wa not formerly indicated by the thermometer and this separation is the cause
    of the solid form which the fluid assumes when a liquid body is raised to the
    boiling temperature by the continued and copious application of heat it particle
    suddenly attract to themselves a great quantity of heat and by this combination
    their mutual relation is so changed that they no longer attract each other but
    are converted into an elastic fluid like air on the other hand when these elastic
    fluid either by condensation or by the application of cold body are reconverted
    into liquid they give out a vast quantity of heat the presence of which wa not
    formerly indicated by the thermometer thus water when converted into ice give
    out  of heat ice when converted into water absorbs  of heat and water when converted
    into steam absorbs about  of heat without becoming sensibly hotter than  philosopher
    had long been accustomed to consider the thermometer a the surest method of detecting
    heat in body  yet this instrument give no indication of the  of heat which enter
    into air when it is converted into water nor of the  which combine with water
    when it is converted into steam dr black therefore said that the heat is concealed
    latet in the water and steam and he briefly expressed this fact by calling the
    heat in that case latent heat dr black having established this discovery by simple
    and decisive experiment drew up an account of the whole investigation and read
    it to a literary society which met every friday in the facultyroom of the college
    consisting of the member of the university and several gentleman of the city who

  text: o r e heid thus hume liad the unexpected credit of awakening the suspicion
    of reid by his sceptical conclusion a he not long afterwards had of arousing kant
    from his  dogmatic slumber a the refutation of hume scepticism wa the great object
    of reid inquiry he took the opportunity of submitting his manuscript through dr
    blair to the great sceptic perusal hume after reading the manuscript wrote to
    reid  i have read your performance with great pleasure and attention it is certainly
    very rare that a piece so deeply philosophical is wrote with so much spirit and
    affords so much entertainment to the reader and again  i kept a watchful eye all
    along over your style  but it is really so correct and so good english that i
    found not anything worth the remarking reid had unquestionably in this work fallen
    upon a mine of the very purest metal and  by an ignorance wiser than knowledge
    worked it out with untiring perseverance it may be fairly questioned however whether
    he wa in all respect consistent in his application of the principle of common
    sense to the refutation of the scepticism of hume or of an idealism more subtle
    than that of berkeley reid informs u that he  had embraced the whole of berkeley
    system in the course of his speculative inquiry  and wa only withheld from giving
    it his final approbation on  finding other consequence to follow from it which
    gave me more uneasiness than the want of a material world his reading in philosophy
    wa to say the least exceedingly limited and this limitation had both it advantage
    and it disadvantage for while it kept his mind comparatively tree and untrammelled
    to look at the fact which his consciousness revealed to him it by this very freedom
    threw him off his guard in analysing the content of his experience and deluded
    him with the conviction that when he had confuted a doctrine under a particular
    development his principle were proof against that doctrine under whatever guise
    it might assume so it wa with the doctrine of idealism which he hastily identified
    with the idealism of berkeley he raised however a substantial protest against
    the doctrine which it wa his business to refute and in his future work wa more
    guarded in his expression a well a more circumspect in his estimate of philosophical
    opinionthe fame of dr reid spread rapidly all over the country and in  he wa invited
    to glasgow to fill the chair of moral philosophy then vacated by dr adam smith
    glasgow at that time presented strong attraction to a man of dr reid habit of
    mind simson moor and black were still in the full vigour of their faculty and
    were still looking forward to long year of intellectual enjoyment animated by
    the presence and stimulated by the zeal of such associate dr reid entered upon
    the new scene of his labour wiui an ardour that wa very uncommon at his period
    of life dugald stewart who wa a pupil of reid in glasgow and who ha left u an
    elegant account of his life and writing in speaking of his merit a a public teacher
    bear the following testimony  the merit of dr reid a a public teacher were derived
    chiefly from that rich fund of original and instructive philosophy which is to
    be found in his writing and from his unwearied assiduity in inculcating principle
    which he conceived to be of essential importance to human happiness in his elocution
    and mode of instruction there wa nothing peculiarly attractive  a brief account
    of aristotle logic with remark appeared in  from the pen of dr reid in the second
    volume of lord karness sketch of the history of man in  reid resolved to retire
    from his public duty and to devote himself while his health and faculty would
    permit to the further elucidation of the phenomenon and law of the human mind
    although at that time upwards of seventy neither in vigour of body nor of mind
    did he seem to have sustained any injury from time fie published his essay on
    the intellectual power of man in   and his essay i d on the active power of man
    appeared in  this last reid performance may be said to have closed his literary
    career for with the exception of short occasional essay on subject which happened
    to interest him written for a philosophical society of which he wa a member it
    w r a the last work he ever wrote his active and useful life wa now drawing to
    a close fie wa seized with a violent disorder in the month of september  and after
    a severe struggle he died on the th of the following month in the eightyseventh
    year of his age dr reid though somewhat under the middle size wa uncommonly muscular
    and athleticadvantages to which his habit of temperance and exercise a well a
    the extreme evenness of his temper contributed not a little in private he combined
    the dignity of the philosopher with the amiable modesty and gentleness of the
    child his philosophical genius wa peculiarly distinguished by a singular patience
    of thought and by a cautious discriminating judgment fie wa endowed by nature
    with a disposition which early worked itself into a habit of rivetting his most
    fixed and concentrated attention on his own mental operation  and though there
    have been men who with such a disposition would unquestionably have drawn from
    the evanescent sphere on which he fixed his contemplation result more brilliant
    and conclusion more startling yet it remains a question whether a loftier genius
    would have outshone reid in the ultimate task of photographing so to speak the
    phenomenon of the human consciousness and of cautiously attending to what that
    consciousness implied he wa by no mean a brilliant thinker  but no philosopher
    ever surpassed him in patience his style wa simple easy and familiar and perhaps
    his work have suffered somewhat from not being written in a language more elaborately
    technical or at least in a manner le readily accessible to the ordinary comprehension
    of men since reid time the estimate of his philosophical capacity have been alike
    curious and various some would have him endowed with a commanding genius at whose
    light darkness became visible and before whose glow all thing false were consumed
    others would degrade him beneath the dignity of the philosophical class and have
    men believe he had no business among philosopher extravagant a these estimate
    must appear they might perhaps find an explanation in the mode of writing which
    the author adopted to the one class not very discriminating his simple and familiar
    language would at once declare him the man of genius while with the other class
    equally undiscriminating the absence of rigorous and severe technicality would
    at once erect a barrier between his talent and their appreciation suffice it to
    say that his philosophy of common sense his theory of external perception still
    hold ground amid the war of conflicting system and the general uprooting of opinion  and
    so far a one can observe amid the dim and dusky confusion attendant on the strife
    it is a philosophy or if men will a bundle of theory which is likely to outride
    the rough weather of human speculation for a considerable time to come the polemic
    which reid implicitly or explicitly carried on wa of a twofold character and the
    method which he brought to it wa in some measure peculiar in the first place it
    wa against the scepticism of hume he directed his primary and ineradicable belief
    and in the second it wa at the idealism of berkeley he aimed his principle of
    the common sense hume a a sceptic who knew well the function he had to fulfil
    accepted the premise afforded him by the sensationalist and carried these premise
    to their legitimate conclusion these conclusion a all know were one weltering
    chaotic sea of the wildest doubt and the fatal reflection regarding the whole
    of his speculation wa the perfect legitimacy of his polemic and the absolute justness
    of his reasoning it wa obvious that if

  text: economist  etonohow in a country where the succession to title to estate mist
    ant i even to the crown itself rested upon custom and y w where the application
    of even the punishment of death wa rarely guided by any written definition the
    government should have thought proper to fix by written law the length and breadth
    of each piece of cloth and the number of thread which it ought to contain he wa
    not le astonished to see the government take in hand to regulate the supply of
    commodity  proscribe one sort of industry in order to make another flourish shackle
    with peculiar restriction the sale of the most necessary article of subsistence  prohibit
    the storing of commodity of which the quantity produced varies greatly from year
    to year while the quantity required for consumption is pretty nearly the same
    restrain the export and import of a commodity subject to the greatest fluctuation
    of price  and dream of insuring the plentiful supply of corn by rendering the
    condition of the labourer more uncertain and more wretched than that of any other
    part of the community ceuvres de m turgot iii  it may easily be imagined that
    m de gournay would find himself encountered by opposition the moment he endeavoured
    to introduce his beneficial view into practice the grand instrument of this opposition
    were certain word and phrase which have been used to screen misrule in every country
    in which the voice of reform ha begun to be raised  m de gournay say turgot  wa
    opposed under the name of an  innovator and a  theorist for endeavouring to develop
    the principle which experience had taught him and which he found universally recognised
    by the most enlightened merchant of every part of the world among whom he had
    lived the principle marked out for reprobation under the title of the  new system
    appeared to him to be exactly the principle of plain good sense the wb de of this
    system wa founded upon the certain maxim the in general each man is a better judge
    of his own interest than another man to whom it is a matter of indifference from
    this m de gournay concluded that when the interest of individual is precisely
    the same with the general interest the best thing to be done is to leave every
    man at liberty to do what he like now he held it a impossible that in commerce
    fairly left to itself the interest of the individual should not coincide with
    the interest of the community the proof which m turgot give of the fundamental
    proposition that the interest of the individual and of the community in a free
    commerce are the same we need not repeat  because it can neither be rendered more
    clear nor more cogent than it is already in work with which every person is familiar
    who is at all conversant with political science  from this principle m de gournay
    concluded that the sole duty of government with regard to commerce are  to render
    to all the branch of industry that precious liberty of which the prejudice of
    barbarous time the proneness of government to lend themselves to the gratification
    of individual interest and the pursuit of a mistaken good have conspired to deprive
    them   to facilitate the exercise of industry and ingenuity to every member of
    the community exciting thereby the greatest competition among seller and ensuring
    the greatest perfection and cheapness of the commodity sold   to admit the greatest
    competition among buyer by opening to the seller every possible market the sole
    mean of encouraging reproduction which hence derives it only reward   to remove
    every obstacle by which the progress of industry is retarded by depriving it of
    it natural reward it is to m de gournay therefore that turgot ascribes the origin
    of political economy in france  it is to the ardour say he  with which m de gournay
    endeavoureconoed to direct to the study of commerce and of political ecomists
    nomy all the talent which he wa able to discover and to the facility with which
    he communicated the light which he himself had acquired that we ought to ascribe
    the happy fermentation which for some year ha been excited on these important
    subject a fermentation which arose two or three year after m de gournay wa intendant
    of commerce and ha since that time procured u several work calculated to wipe
    off from our nation that reproach of frivolity which by it indifference for the
    more useful study it had but too justly incurred francis quesnay wa born in the
    village of ecqueville in the year  according to m dupont de nemours the editor
    and commentator of the work of turgot and a zealous economist he wa the son of
    a small proprietor who cultivated his own little property  and he wa eminently
    indebted to his mother for the forming of his mind though he wa educated a a physician
    and rose to such eminence in his profession a to be first physician to the king
    the early occupation of his mind on the business of agriculture had given the
    current of his thought a permanent direction  and when he wa summoned to reflect
    on the source of wealth by the discussion probably to which the speculation of
    m de gournay had given birth agriculture wa the object on which his attention
    wa more particularly fixed he produced several work on different point of the
    science and practice of medicine  and it wa only at a late period of life that
    his work on political economy appeared his chief production on this subject physiocratie
    ou du gouvernement le plus avantageux au genre humain wa first published in  not
    only had the speculation which he broached and which he propagated with much fervour
    and diligence considerable success in the world but he had the fortune to gain
    a considerable number of proselyte who exerted themselves with an ardour for the
    diffusion of his doctrine and with a devotion to the opinion of their master which
    more resembled the enthusiasm of the votary of a new religion or that of the follower
    of some of the ancient philosopher than the indifference with which new speculation
    in philosophy have on all other occasion been received in modern europe and which
    gave to the economist more of the character of a sector a school than ha appeared
    to belong to those who have in recent time concurred in any other system of philosophical
    opinion there wa in truth in the system of m quesnay and the other economist many
    thing well calculated to attract attention and excite enthusiasm from a few simple
    principle they deduced a they imagined by a chain of very close and imposing argument
    a system of change which would easily be introduced without the smallest interruption
    to the tranquillity and happiness of the existing generation calculated to remove
    from society all the deformity by which it wa overspread and to communicate to
    the mass of human being a fulness of happiness hitherto altogether unknown at
    this point therefore we may close the historical part of this article  for the
    success of the great work of dr adam smith in a short time superseded the political
    economy of the sect and after the political economy wa discredited the rest of
    their doctrine met with little regard the memory of them however is well worthy
    of being preserved  and this task we shall now in a few word a possible endeavour
    to perform ii the economist proceeded upon no utopian plan which supposes society
    to be composed of being different from those with whom we are already acquainted
    they took man a he is a being having want and governed by the desire of avoiding
    pain and obtaining pleasure

    go to the whole extent there will still be some balance more or le what then is
    the case the case is that the loss go to the whole and that the balance doe not
    exist the balance doe not exist a far a the private interest of those who share
    among them the governing power are concerned but it is only from the private interest
    of those who govern that the nation ha any thing to fear it is only against these
    interest that the balance is provided a far however a these private interest are
    concerned the balance doe not exist a far therefore a the balance is even supposed
    to be of any service the balance is excluded by the law of nature it follows a
    a corollary that in a country where the people depend upon what is called a balance
    a the whole of their security for good government they have no security at all
    such is the analysis which the econcmists present of the cause of good and evil
    in human society and of that order of thing which best insures the presence of
    the one and the absence of the other that part of their doctrine which alone is
    yet known to the mere english reader their political economy is introduced a only
    an auxiliary exposition it is part of the development by which they endeavoured
    to prove the identity which they supposed between the interest of the sovereign
    and the interest of the people but a a very distinct account of this part of their
    system ha been given by dr adam smith and other writer and a our object rather
    wa the exhibition of those doctrine of the sect which nobody ha yet presented
    to our countryman in their own language we shall content ourselves with only marking
    the place which their political economy held in their general system a the society
    ha public expense it is necessary that mist it also have a public revenue to reconcile
    the formation econoof a public revenue with the idea of social order it ought
    nnst  to be formed if possible without infringing the property of individual for
    the sake of which the order of society itself is established it ought therefore
    if possible to be formed without diminishing the revenue of individual when the
    real origin of revenue the source from which it all is drawn is sufficiently understood
    the mode of forming a revenue for the sovereign without diminishing that of individual
    would be immediately apparent the source of all rich is the land  because the
    land alone of cdl the source of production yield a produce greater than the cost
    of the production the surplus produce of the land therefore constitutes a fund
    which is over and above the remuneration to the agent of production and out of
    which the revenue of the sovereign may be taken without diminishing the motive
    to production that is without retarding the natural progress of the state in wealth
    population and felicity to lay the foundation for this plan of a public revenue
    it wa necessary to prove that the land is the only source of production and that
    manufacture and commerce though they alter the form of thing never add any thing
    to the amount or value of production in the development of these view one of the
    most remarkable result at which the economist arrived wa the necessity of perfect
    freedom to all the proceeding which lead to production a giving to produce that
    form which is most agreeable to those who are to make use of it till the time
    of the economist the necessity of holding those proceeding in chain and binding
    them to the will of government wa the universal doctrine of government and to
    a great degree of speculator themselves the general principle of the economist
    respecting the freedom of property necessary to constitute the foundation of social
    order led them to infer the evil of those abridgment of freedom but they examined
    the inference in detail and showed that the meddling officiousness of government
    to compel industry to one thing and exclude it from another not only failed to
    effect any good purpose but of necessity created obstruction of the greatest magnitude
    to production in general and tended powerfully to keep down the wealth population
    and prosperity of the state the light which they diffused on this subject and
    which soon produced a grand effect on the mind of men wa a good the magnitude
    of which is beyond calculation another of their conclusion is that the revenue
    of the sovereign taken a they said it ought to be wholly from the net produce
    of the land ought to be a fixed and unalterable proportion of that produce the
    reason appeared to them conclusive if the proportion wa variable and depended
    upon the will of the owner of the land they might be induced to break upon the
    public revenue and deprive the state of those benefit which the public revenue
    is necessary to produce if it depended upon the sovereign the property of the
    land might be detached from that of it produce nobody would have a motive to become
    a proprietor in land and all the advantage which depend on the existence of that
    property would be lost the production of subsistence would fail and the community
    could not exist this proportion being once fixed there is no longer any contrariety
    between the interest of the sovereign and the interest of any portion of his people  and
    the proprietor cf land are a completely and securely exempt from contributing
    to the expense of the state a any other class of the community the sovereign derives
    no part of his revenue from the subject and this deplorable source of the conflict
    of interest is wholly cut off the proportion being settled for ever between the
    sovereign and the land

    of smith a it touched those matter which may he numbered and measured and weighed

    been le complete his genius is not le conspicuous perhaps there is no ethical
    work since cicero office of which an abridgement enables the reader so inadequately
    to estimate the merit a the theory of moral sentiment this is not chiefly owing
    to the beauty of diction a in the case of cicero but to the variety of explanation
    of life and manner which embellish the book often more than they illuminate the
    theory yet on the other hand it must be owned that for purely philosophical purpose
    few hook more need abridgement for the most careful reader frequently loses sight
    of principle buried under illustration the naturally copious and flowing style
    of the author is generally redundant and the repetition of certain formulary of
    the system is in the later edition so frequent a to be wearisome and sometimes
    ludicrous perhaps smith and hobbes may be considered a forming the two extreme
    of good style in our philosophy the first of graceful fulness falling into flaccidity
    while the masterly concision of the second is oftener tainted by dictatorial dryness
    hume and berkeley though they are nearer the extreme of abundance  are probably
    the least distant from perfection that mankind are so constituted a to sympathize
    with each others feeling and to feel pleasure in the accordance of these feeling
    are the only fact required by hr smith and they certainly must be granted to him
    to adopt the feeling of another is to approve them when the sentiment of another
    are such a would be excited in u by the same object we approve them a morally
    proper to obtain this accord it becomes necessary for him who enjoys or suffers
    to lower his expression of feeling to the point to which the bystander can raise

    prevented by indisposition from delivering the regular lecture he used generally
    to delegate the task of instruction to his youthful pupil wilkie besides being
    a scholar and philosopher of no mean note wa a man of primitive benevolence and
    integrity and of great vivacity in conversation  and the friendship which in spite
    of the disparity of their year wa speedily formed between him and young playfair
    speaks a much for the social and moral character of the latter a his substitution
    of him in the classroom doe for his early proficiency in science on this last
    subject we shall mention but one fact more in  when only eighteen year of age
    he offered himself with the approbation of his instructor at st andrew a candidate
    for the professorship of mathematics in marischal college aberdeen and sustained
    with the most distinguished credit an examination  comparative trial which lasted
    eleven day and embraced nearly the whole range of the exact science out of the
    six competitor who entered the list against him two only were judged to have excelled
    him the reverend dr trail who wa appointed to the office and dr hamilton who afterwards
    succeeded to and long filled it with much re j n  he removed to edinburgh where
    his merit and modesty very soon introduced him to the friendship of dr robertson
    adam smith dr matthew stewart dr black and dr hutton  with all of whom he continued
    on term of the utmost cordiality during the whole period of their life in  he
    wa a candidate for the professorship of natural philosophy at st andrew vacant
    by the death of his friend dr wilkie there wa no comparative trial on this occasion
    and he wa again unsuccessful under circumstance which have led one of the most
    dutiful son of that university dr cook in his life of principal hill to remark  how
    much it suffered in thus losing a man by whose talent it reputation would have
    been so highly promoted in the course of the same year the death of his father
    suddenly devolved upon him the burden of supporting the family and admonished
    him no longer to delay the final election of a profession he had been educated
    with a view to the church and wa every way qualified to accept a living on the
    establishment but his decided piedilection for science had hitherto made him hesitate
    about engaging in a vocation the duty of which he felt if conscientiously discharged
    would necessarily interfere to a great extent with the study he wa loath to abandon
    in this emergency however he thought himself no longer entitled to indulge in
    those predilection and accordingly made application to lord gray the patron for
    a presentation to the living of lift and benvie which had been filled by his father
    his lordship wa too well aware of his merit to hesitate about conferring so great
    a benefit on his parishioner  and immediately issued a presentation in his favour
    although from some challenge of his right to the patronage induction wa not obtained
    until late in the year  from this period until  playfair wa constantly resident
    at lift and occupied almost exclusively with the pastoral duty of his office in
    this retreat his leisure hour were dedicated to the education of his younger brother
    and to a very close and intimate correspondence with robertson afterwards lord
    robertson the son of the illustrious historian to whom he seems to have confined
    the remark that occurred to him upon the different author he perused and the subject
    of speculation which they suggested we cannot help hoping that some selection
    from this correspondence may one day be given to the public in the year  he contributed
    to the transaction of the royal society of london a paper on the  arithmetic of
    impossible quantity which exhibit within a very small compass a striking example
    of the rare and admirable playfair talent of detaching the sound spirit of science
    from what may be termed it mysticism and circumscribing by t e most precise and
    luminous boundary the vague and unlimited inquiry into which many mathematician
    had been seduced by the nature of the instrument they emthe year  he wa induced
    by very advantageous offer to resign his charge and to superintend the education
    of ferguson of raith and his brother sir ronald  an arrangement which restored
    him in a great measure to the literary and scientific society of edinburgh and
    enablec him to gratify himself by a personal introduction to several of the most
    eminent cultivator of science in london he had repeatedly visited dr maskelyne
    astronomerroyal whilst that ingenious mathematician wa busied in  in making a
    series of observation in perthshire on the attraction of mountain  and whilst
    sharing the shelter ol his tent on the side of schehallien contracted with him
    a cordial friendship which continued unbroken for the remainder of their life
    under these honourable auspex he made his first appearance in london in  and wa
    speedily introduced to all those in whom he wa likely to take most interest he
    seems to have kept a pretty full and correct journal of all that he observed during
    this journey to the metropolis  and a portion of it which is prefixed to the late
    collection of his work is in our judgment one of the most interesting part of
    that publication it is not only written with great elegance and accuracy but affords
    in the fre candid and pointed observation which it contains on the different individual
    with whom he come in contact a very remarkable proof of his quick and sagacious
    perception of character and his power ot selecting and turning to account even
    in the fever and distraction of a first visit to such a scene all that wa really
    worthy of careful observation or permanent remembrance in  he wa received into
    the university of edinburgh in consequence of an arrangement between his two illustrious
    associate dr adam ferguson and mr dugald stewart mr stewart exchanged the chair
    of mathematics in which he had succeeded to his father for that of moral philosophy
    which had been long filled by dr ferguson who finding that the delicate state
    of his health would prevent him from discharging the active duty of the mathematical
    professor immediately devolved them upon playfair for whom he procured the appointment
    of joint professor in that department in  he published in the transaction of the
    royal society of edinburgh a biographical account of dr matthew stewart which
    is remarkable not only for the ease and purity of the style but also a containing
    a singularly clear and interesting account of the labour of dr simson in the restoration
    of the ancient geometry and of the success both of him and dr stewart in adapting
    the elegant simplicity of the greek method of investigation to problem which had
    previously been regarded a insoluble except by the aid of the modern analysis
    he also published in the same year a paper  on the cause which affect the accuracy
    of barometrical measurement which is written with all the perspicuity caution
    and sagacity that constitute the great excellence and the great difficulty of
    such disquisition where scientific principle are employed to give precision to
    physical observation in  he published in the same transaction a paper of still
    greater interest and delicacy  on the astronomy of the brahminsa subject which
    had been recently recommended to the notice of the european scientific world by

    and to support our lofty idea of the grandeur of human nature  and of which it
    seems hard to confine exclusively the knowledge to that portion of mankind who
    have been favoured with the light of revelation the influence of the same fundamental
    error arising too from the same mistaken idea of thus strengthening the cause
    of christianity may be traced in various passage of the posthumous work of the
    late bishop of llandaff it is wonderful that the reasoning of clarke and of butler
    did not teach these eminent men a sounder and more consistent logic or at least

    of that which is revealedsermon   there is an intrinsical good and evil in thing
    and the reason and respect of moral good and evil are fixed and immutable eternal
    and indispensable nor do they speak safely who make the divine will the rule of

    the performance of such duty a natural light without any express and supernatural
    revelation doth dictate to men these lie at the bottom of all religion and are
    the great fundamental duty which god requires of all mankind these are the surest
    and most sacred of all other law  those which god hath rivetted in our soul and
    written upon our heart  and these are what we call moral duty and most valued
    by god which are of eternal and perpetual obligation because they do naturally
    oblige without any particular and express revelation from god  and these are the

    differenta doctrine which whatever may be thought of it in other respect is undoubtedly
    a great improvement on that of malebranche which by representing god a the only
    agent in the universe wa not le inconsistent than the scheme of spinoza with the
    moral nature of man  the deity say baxter is not only at the bead of nature but
    in every part of it a chain of material cause betwixt the deity and the effect
    produced and much more a series of them is such a supposition a would conceal
    the deity from the knowledge of mortal for ever we might search for matter above

    english themselves we are told are now pretty well convinced that robertson is
    a careless superficial and blundering historian although they study his work and
    are right in doing so a model of pure composition extremely deserving of attention
    during the present declining state of english style    with all the abundance
    of his italian elegance what is the overloaded and affected roscoe when compared
    with gibbon  coxe although master of a good and classical style resembles robertson
    in no respect so much a in the superncialness of his research and the statesman
    fox ha nothing in common with hume but the bigotry of his party zeal such criticism

  text: preliminary dissertation early habit of abstract meditation to this fact burke
    probably alluded when he remarked that i by turning the soul inward on itself
    it force are concentered and are fitted for stronger and bolder flight of science
    and that in such pursuit whether we take or whether we lose the game the chase
    is certainly of service the name of locke of berkeley of hume of quesnai of turgot
    of morellet and above all of adam smith will at once illustrate the truth of these
    observation and show that in combining together in this dissertation the science
    of metaphysics of ethic and of politics i have not adopted an arrangement altogether
    capricious  in farther justification of this arrangement i might appeal to the
    popular prejudice so industriously fostered by many against these three branch
    of knowledge a ramification from one common and most pernicious root how often
    have mr smith reasoning in favour of the freedom of trade been ridiculed a metaphysical
    and visionary  nay but a few year have elapsed since this epithet accompanied
    with the still more opprobrious term of atheistical and democratical wa applied
    to the argument then urged against the morality and policy of the slavetrade and
    in general to every speculation in which any appeal wa made to the beneficent
    arrangement of nature or to the progressive improvement of the human race absurd
    a this language wa it could not for a moment have obtained any currency with the
    multitude had there not been an obvious connection between these liberal doctrine
    and the well known habit of logical thinking which so eminently distinguished
    their author and advocate whatever praise therefore may be due to the father of
    the modern science of political economy belongs at least in part according to
    the acknowledgment of their most decided adversary to those abstract study by
    which they were prepared for an analytical investigation of it first and fundamental
    principle other connection and affinity between political economy and the philosophy
    of the human mind will present themselves afterwards at present i purposely confine
    myself to that which is most obvious and indisputable the influence of metaphysical
    study may be also perceived in the philosophical spirit so largely infused into
    the best historical composition of the last century this spirit ha indeed been
    often perverted to pernicious purpose but who can doubt that on the whole both
    history and philosophy have gained infinitely by the alliance  how far a similar
    alliance ha been advantageous to our poetry may be more reasonably questioned
    but on the most unfavourable supposition it must be admitted that the number of
    poetical reader ha thereby been greatly increased and the pleasure of imagination
    proportionally communicated to a wider circle the same remark may be extended
    to the study of philosophical criticism if it ha not contributed to the encouragement
    of original genius in the fine art it ha been followed by a much more beneficial
    result in diffusing a relish for the beautiful and the elegant not to mention
    it influence in correcting and fixing the public taste by the precision and steadiness
    of the principle to which it appeal  another instance still more important of
    the practical influence of metaphysical science is the improvement which since
    the time of locke ha become general in the conduct of education  it furnishes
    no objection to these remark that some of our best treatise on question of political
    economy have proceeded from men who were stranger to metaphysical study it is
    enough for my purpose if it be granted that it wa by habit of metaphysical thinking
    that the mind of those author were formed by whom political economy wa first exalted
    to the dignity of a science to a great proportion even of the learned the rule
    of a sound logic are best taught by example  and when a precise and welldefined
    phraseology is once introduced the speculation of the most ordinary writer assume
    an appearance sometimes it must be owned a very fallacious one of depth and consistency
    fontenelle remark that a single great man is sufficient to accomplish a change
    in the taste of his age and that the perspicuity and method for which descartes
    wa indebted to his mathematical research were successfully copied by many of his
    contemporary who were ignorant of mathematics a similar observation will he found
    to apply with still greater force to the model of metaphysical analysis and of
    logical discussion exhibited in the political work of hume and of smith  see some
    admirable remark on this subject by gray in his comment on the jo of plato edition

  text: w a t t watt but be remained little more than a twelvemonth the infirm state
    of his health compelling his return to his paternal roof in that short period
    he appears to have made great proficiency and he continued after his return to
    scotland to perfect himself in this art both at home and on his visit to his mother
    relation at glasgow where it wa his wish to establish himself but some opposition
    being made by the corporation who considered him a an intruder upon their privilege
    the professor of the university took him under their protection and accommodated
    him with an apartment and premise for carrying on his business within their precinct
    with the title and office of mathematical instrument maker to the university this
    took place in  when he wa twentyone year of age and it must be inferred that he
    had already given satisfactory proof of talent to the eminent men who then adorned
    that seat of learning  of whom it is sufficient to mention the name of robert
    simson adam smith dr black and dr dick the professor of natural philosophy there
    mr watt applied sedulously to business and in the few interval which it concern
    and ill health allowed cultivated those various talent which distinguished him
    in afterlife and there a lasting friendship wa formed with the kindred mind of
    dr black and of mr afterwards dr robison then a student at the university and
    nearly of his own age he remained in the college until some time in the year  when
    he removed into the town previously to his marriage with his cousin miss miller
    which took place in the summer of the following year the steamengine had been
    a frequent subject of conversation between mr robison and himself and the former
    had suggested the possibility of it application to the moving of wheelcarriages
    about the year  or  mr watt had tried some experiment on the force of steam in
    a papins digester and had constructed and worked with strong steam a small model
    consisting of an inverted syringe the bottom of the rod of which wa loaded with
    a weight alternately admitting the steam below the piston and letting it off to
    the atmosphere observing the imperfection of this construction he soon abandoned
    it but the attention necessary to be bestowed upon his business prevented his
    reconsidering it until the winter of  when he wa employed by the professor of
    natural philosophy to put in order a working model of a steamengine upon newcomens
    construction when he had repaired it and set it to work he found that the boiler
    though large in proportion to the cylinder wa barely able to supply it with steam
    for a few stroke per minute and that a great quantity of injectionwater wa required
    though it wa but lightly loaded by the pump attached to it it soon occurred that
    the cause lay in the little cylinder  inch diameter  inch stroke exposing a greater
    surface to condense the steam than the cylinder of larger engine did in proportion
    to their respective content by shortening the column of water in the pump le steam
    and le injectionwater were required and the model worked at a proper speed thus
    the purpose for which it wa put into his hand wa accomplished  and with this mode
    of accounting for the defect and this result most artist would have been satisfied  but
    the case wa different with mr watt he had now become aware of a great consumption
    of steam and his curiosity wa excited to a more accurate investigation of the
    cause in which he proceeded in a truly philosophical manner the cylinder of his
    small model being of brass he conceived that le steam would be condensed by substituting
    cylinder of some material which would transmit heat more slowly he made a larger
    model with a cylinder  inch diameter and  foot stroke of wood soaked in oil and
    baked to dryness he ascertained from experiment made with boiler of various construction
    that the evaporation of boiling water is neither in proportion to the evaporating
    surface nor to the quantity of water a had been supposed but to the heat that
    enters it and that the latter depended chiefly on the quantity of surface exposed
    to the action of the fire he likewise determined the weight of coal required for
    the evaporation of any given quantity of water being convinced that there existed
    a great error in the statement which had been previously given of the bulk ol
    water when converted into steam he proceeded to examine that point by experiment
    and discovered that water converted into steam of the heat of boiling water wa
    expanded to  time it bulk or a a rule for ready calculation that a cubic inch
    of water produced a cubic loot of steam he constructed a boiler to be applied
    to his model which should show by inspection the quantity of water evaporated
    and consequently would enable him to calculate the quantity of steam used in every
    stroke of the engine this he now proved to be several time the full of the cylinder
    he also observed that all attempt to improve the vacuum by throwing in more injection
    water caused a disproportionate waste of steam  and it occurred to him that the
    cause of this wa the boiling of water in vacuo at very low heat recently determined
    by dr cullen to be under   consequently at greater heat the injectionwater wa
    converted into steam in the cylinder and resisted the descent of the piston he
    now perceived clearly that the great waste of steam proceeded from it being chilled
    and condensed by the coldness of the cylinder before it wa sufficiently heated
    to retain it in an elastic state  and that to derive the greatest advantage the
    cylinder should always be kept a hot a the steam which entered it and that when
    the steam wa condensed it should be cooled down to  or lower in order to make
    the vacuum complete early in  the fortunate thought occurred to him of accomplishing
    this by condensing the steam in a separate vessel exhausted of air and kept cool
    by injection between which and the cylinder a communication wa to be opened every
    time steam wa to be condensed while the cylinder itself wa to be kept constantly
    hot no sooner had this occurred to him than the mean of effecting it presented
    themselves in rapid succession these in a great measure have already been described
    in the present work a model wa constructed and the experiment made with it placed
    the correctness of the theory and the advantage of the invention beyond the reach
    of doubt in the course of these trial he wa much struck by the great heat communicated
    to the injectionwater by a small quantity of steam  and he proceeded by a very
    simple experiment to satisfy himself upon that subject when he discovered that
    water converted into steam will heat about six time it own weight of water at  or  to  he
    mentioned this extraordinary fact to dr black who then explained to him his doctrine
    of latent heat to the support of which mr watt had afterwards the satisfaction
    of contributing his experiment from some of these he wa led to suppose the latent
    heat of steam to be above  but he afterwards considered  a more accurate determination
    from others he deduced the important conclusion that the sum of the latent and
    sensible heat of steam at different temperature is a constant quantity the latent
    heat increasing a the sensible heat diminishes  or in other word that a given
    weight of water in the state of steam contains nearly the same quantity of heat
    whatever may be the bulk or density of the steam he also at this time made experiment
    upon the capacity ol different body for heat and upon the heat at which water
    boil under various pressure from which he ascertained that where the heat proceeded
    in an arithmetical the elasticity proceeded in a geometrical ratio

    more enthusiastic in his appreciation of his genius and sir humphry davy in a
    speech manifesting a just estimate of his peculiar merit did not hesitate to place
    him on a level with archimedes  but a testimony more authoritative and unbiassed
    than any of these is the fact that watt wa elected first a corresponding member
    of the french institute and finally one of the eight foreign associate of the
    academy of science this honour to which so few can attain which newton once owned
    and which now  grace or lately graced the name of young humboldt oersted brewster

    a space of but a few line ha been devoted to them which seems inadequate to their
    importance for detail however we must refer to the article in the encyclopaedia
    where they are explained at full length no doubt we cannot in strictness call
    watt the f     inventor of the steamengine the grand principle of rendering the
    heat contained in steam available a engine an economical source of moving power
    may be traced so far back that we lose the clue altogether in the obscure or impracticable
    or simply puerile shape in w hich the idea wa contained even in the time of worcester  we
    must be allowed to doubt whether the history of the steamengine had outgrown the
    mythical stage  papin indeed proposed a piston and cylinder in which the vacuum
    wa produced by steam instead of by the airpump a already suggested or practised
    by guericke  but savery   wa the first who constructed a steamengine and applied
    it to the drainage of mine his invention included the two capital property of
    steam it power of producing a vacuum by condensation and it elastic force at high
    temperature a few year later the pistonfoim wa introduced or reinvented by newcomen
    and cawley a well a the valuable expedient of producing condensation by a squirt
    of cold w  ater injected into the cylinder and in this condition the atmospheric
    engine remained with slight improvement for above half a century doing the work
    for which it wa inventedthe pumping of water out of shaft the pump being moved
    by a chain attached to the end of a horizontal oscillating beamwherever economy
    of fuel wa unimportant such wa the case at coal pit but in other mine usually
    situated remote from coal it wa of comparatively little use on account of the
    enormous consumption of fuel james watt wa born at greenock in  and  owing to
    feeble health seems to have enjoyed little advantage from regular tuition of any
    kind  which hig  wa however to a great extent made up for by the tory intelligent

    a reduction which wa afterwards confirmed by the th car ii and finally in the
    reign of queen anne a statute th anne cap  wa framed reducing the rate of interest
    to  per cent at which it stood   in the pieamble to this statute it is stated
    that c whereas the reducing interest to  and from thence to  and thence to  in
    the hundred hath from time to time by expei ience been found very beneficial to
    the advancement of trade and the improvement of land it is become absolutely necessary
    to reduce the high rate of interest of  per cent to a nearer proportion to the
    interest allowed for money in foreign state it wa for these reason enacted that
    all bargain or contract stipulating for a higher rate of interest than  per cent
    should be utterly void  and  that all person who should after that time receive
    by mean of any corrupt bargain loan exchange chevizance or interest of any ware

    a year should forfeit for every such offence the treble value of the money or
    other thing so lent bargained c in scotland previously to the reformation no interest
    could be legally charged but that great event by weakening the force of those
    religious prejudice which had chiefly dictated the prohibition of interest led
    to the adoption of more liberal opinion on the subject and to the enactment of
    the statute of th park jac vi cap  which legalized interest to the extent of  per
    cent in  the legal rate wa reduced to  per cent and in  to  per cent the statute
    of anne reducing the rate of interest to  per cent extended to both kingdom the
    statute prohibiting the taking of interest in ireland were not repealed until  when
    the statute th car i cap  gave liberty to stipulate for any rate not exceeding  percent
    in  this rate wa reduced to  per cent in  it wa reduced to  per cent and in  in
    wa further reduced to  per cent in france the rate of interest wa fixed at  per
    cent so rest early a  and this a few short interval only excepted continued to
    be the legal rate till the revolution laverdy  m  reduced it from  to  per cent
    instead however of the market rate being proportionally reduced it wa raised from  to  per
    cent previously to the promulgation of the edict loan might have been obtained
    on good security at  per cent but an additional per cent wa afterwards required
    to cover the illegality this caused the speedy abandonment of the measure  the
    same thing happened in livonia in  when the empress catherine reduced interest
    from  to  per cent ditherto say storch in loco citato those who had good security
    to offer were able to borrow at  per cent but lenceforth they had to pay  per
    cent or upwards and such will be found to be invariably the case when the legal
    is jess man the market rate of interest it ha been observed by adam smith that
    the statutory i egulations reducing interest in england were made with great propriety
    instead of preceding they followed the fall which wa gradually taking place in
    the market rate of interest and therefore did not contribute a they would otherwise
    have done to raise that which they were intended to reduce sir josiah child whose
    treatise recommending a reduction of interest to  per cent wa originally published
    in   state that the goldsmith of london who then acted a banker could obtain a
    much money a they pleased upon their servant note only at  per cent i he supposed
    insecurity of the revolutionary establishment and the novelty of the practice
    of funding occasioned the payment of a high rate of interest for a large portion
    of the sum borrowed by the public in the reign of william iii and anne but private
    person of undoubted credit could then borrow at le than  per cent during the reign
    of george ii the market rate of interest fluctuated from  to  and  per cent  smith
    mention that the increased mean of profitably investing capital acquired during
    the war terminated by the peace of paris in  raised the market rate of interest
    to a level with the statutory rate or perhaps higher but it wa not until the subsequent
    european war that any very material or general inconvenience wa found to result
    from the limitation of interest to  per cent it is necessary however to observe
    that this remark applies exclusively to loan negotiated by individual who could
    offer unexceptionable security  for since the act of  person engaged in employment
    of more than ordinary hazard or whose character for prudence and punctuality did
    not stand high or who could only offer inferior security were unable to borrow
    at  per cent and were consequently compelled to resort to a variety of scheme
    for defeating or evading the enactment in the statute the most common device wa
    the sale of an annuity thus supposing an individual whose personal credit wa indifferent

    an v   unnecessary expense by purchasing bill on london at a greater jtwewzmwi
    than would suffice to cover the expense of a money remittance if owing to the
    badness of road disturbance in the country or any other cause the expense of remitting
    money from glasgow to london were increased the difference in the rate of exchange
    between them might also be proportionally increased but in every case the extent
    to which this difference could attain would be limited by and could not for any
    considerable period exceed the cost of remitting cash exchange transaction become
    more complex when one place a is often the case discharge it debt to another by
    mean of bill drawn on a third place thus though london should owe nothing to glasgow
    yet if glasgow be indebted to london london to manchester and manchester to glasgow
    the latter may wholly or partially discharge her debt to london by remitting bill
    on manchester she may wholly discharge it provided the debt due to her by manchester
    exceed or is equal to the debt due by hei to london if however it be not equal
    to the latter glasgow will either have to remit money to london to pay the balance
    of debt or bill on some other place indebted to her transaction in inland bill
    of exchange are almost entirely conducted by banker who charge a cei tain rate
    per cent for their trouble and who by mean of theii ciedit and connection are
    able on all occasion to supply the demand of their customer london because of
    it extensive correspondence with other part of the country occasioned partly by
    it immense commerce partly by it being the seat of government and the place to
    which the revenue is remitted and partly by it currency consisting of bank of
    england paper for which the note of the country bank are rendered exchangeable
    ha become the grand focus in which the money transaction of the united kingdom
    centre and in which they are all ultimately adjusted these circumstance but especially
    the demand for bill on london to remit revenue and the superior value of bank
    of england paper render the exchange between london and other part of the country
    invariably in her favour bill on london drawn in edinburgh and glasgow were formerly
    made payable at forty day date which wa equivalent to a premium of about  per
    cent but owing to the greater facility of communication this premium is now reduced
    to twenty day interest or to about i per cent bill for remitting the revenue from
    scotland are now drawn at thirty day previously to  they were drawn at sixty day
    these statement are sufficient to show that how well soever bill of exchange may
    be fitted for facilitating the operation of commerce and saving the trouble and
    expense attending the transportation of money mercantile transaction cannot be
    adjusted by their mean except in so far a they mutually balance each other a real
    bill of exchange is merely an order entitling the holdei to receive payment of
    a debt due by the person on whom it is drawn it is essential to the existence
    of such bill that an equivalent amount of debt should be contracted and hence
    a the amount of the real bill of exchange drawn on any number of merchant cannot
    exceed the amount of their debt if a greater sum be owing by them than they owe
    to others the balance must either be paid in money or by the delivery of some
    sort of commodity if fis in the case referred to glasgow owe london ll while london
    only owes glasgow l a reciprocal transfer of debt may be made to the extent of
    l but the glasgow merchant cannot discharge the additional l by mean of bill on
    london for by the supposition london only owed them l and they have drawn for
    it amount this balance must therefore be discharged by an actual money payment
    or by the delivery of some specie of pioduce or by bill on some third party indebted
    to glasexchange gow   it is not meant by this to insinuate that fictitious bill
    of exchange or bill drawn on person who are not really indebtedto the drawer are
    either unknown or very rare in commercial country bill of this description are
    always to be met with  but they are a device for obtaining loan and cannot transfer
    real debt a of london may form a connection with b of glasgow and draw bill upon
    him payable a certain number of day after date which the latter may retire by
    selling bill upon a the merchant who purchase or the banker who discount these
    bill advance their value to the drawer who by mean of this system of drawing and
    redrawing command a borrowed capital equal to the amount of the fictitious paper
    in circulation it is clear however that the negotiation of such bill cannot assist
    in transferring and settling the bona fide debt of two or more place fictitious
    bill mutually balance each other those drawn by london on glasgow equal those
    drawn by glasgow on london for the one set is drawn to pay the otherthe second
    destroys the first and the result is nothing the raising of money by mean of fictitious
    bill ha been severely censured by adam smith who say it entail a ruinous expense
    on those engaged in it and is resorted to only by projector or person of suspicious
    credit when fictitious bill are drawn at two month date it is common to charge
    in addition to the ordinary interest a commission of half or quarter per cent
    which must be paid every time the bill is discounted or at least six time ayear
    the total expense of money raised in this way could not therefore supposing the
    transaction to be always on account of the same individual and interest  per cent
    be estimated at le than  or  per cent per annum ex stamp and the payment of so
    high an interest on borrowed capital in a country where the ordinary rate of mercantile
    profit is not supposed to average more than from six to eight per cent could not
    fail to be frequently productive of ruin to the borrower but it seldom happens
    that in the negotiation of fictitious bill the charge for commission fall on one
    individual only loan obtained in this way are usually on account of two or more
    party at one time a fictitious bill is drawn by a of london on b of glasgow and
    in this case the latter will before the bill becomes due draw upon a for it amount
    including interest and commission at another time the transaction will be on account
    of b who in that case ha to pay commission to his friend in london  so that each
    party may on the whole a mr thornton ha observed gain about a much a he pay in
    the shape of commission it is often extremely difficult to distinguish fictitious
    bill from those which have arisen out of real transaction neither doe it seem
    to be of any very material importance the character and credit of the party whose
    name are attached to bill are the only criterion by which merchant or banker can
    judge whether they ought to negotiate them the circumstance of an individual offering
    accommodation paper for discount ought unquestionably if it be known to excite
    suspicion of his credit but unless in so far a the drawing of fictitious bill
    may be held to be indicative of overtrading or of a deficiency of capital to carry
    on the business in which the party is engaged there doe not appear to be any very
    good reason for refusing to discount them within the last few year it ha been
    the practice to grant money order payable on presentation at the different postoffices
    for sum of l and under these order cost d for sum of l and under and d for sum

    philosophy which had long been a favourite object of his ambition he entered on
    his new duty with a degree of spirit and activity from which the most splendid
    result were to be anticipated in his discourse he seldom had recourse to note

    nearly connected with his mother family and still more nearly related to his intimate
    friend dr black soon afterwards he began to cultivate a farm in the parish of

    the chair vacant his friend in the university particularly drs robertson blair

    particular area whenever there should occur an occasion for enumerating them it
    wa in britain with it abstinent government and unrestrained people that the want
    of population statistic became most flagrantly conspicuous it is difficult at
    present to realize the idea that long after adam smith day the number of the inhabitant
    ot the british empire could only be guessed at a the populousness of china is
    at the present day and a in all matter of statistic which have their own simple
    solution through specific inquiry the guess about the population of the empire
    were not only vague but extravagantly contradictory during the eighteenth century
    the most trustworthy geographer were generally those who did not venture on an
    estimate of the population even in those european state which had the best mean
    of enumeration at their command the first effort to take a census of the population
    ot great britain wa made in  it did not then extend to ireland the success which
    attended this and the two succeeding effort wa mainly owing to the zeal and ability
    of mr rickman the assistantclerk of the house of common where there is an organization
    like that of many in the european state for preserving a constant official record
    of all the fluctuation of the population not only m their absolute number throughout
    a whole territory but in the relative number in it respective part a they may

    obtaining a general census at anv one moment but for checking it accuracy and
    classifying it element but to deal at once with the raw material in the selfgoverned
    british empire required great ingenuity and sagacity a census to be accurate must
    be taken on a uniform system and must be taken simultaneously any enumeration
    going over a tract of time weie it but two day must be more or le inaccurate and
    destitute of the mean of correcting it own inaccuracy besides the mere abstract
    number of the people there  much collateral information to be recorded this besides
    it own intrinsic value is necessary a a check on the number  since a distribution
    into element according to sex age social condition occupation and the like affords
    a seltacting control on the accuracy of mere figure in a census indeed it is a
    simple rule that the information returned should be ramified a far beyond the
    main fact a with safety to these it can be carried the tendency towards complexity
    in the nature of the return must alway s be checked by the liability of the people
    at large to make blunder and create confusion where they are qmred to attest fact
    not of the most obvious nature and by the difficulty of getting a number of subordinate

    there are very considerable difference gold and silver like iron coal tin c are

    in those possessed only of mine of a secondary degree of fertility or where they
    have to be entirely brought from abroad and the exchange between such place is
    not a true par unless adequate allowance be made for this difference of value
    d hus if because of the expense of carriage the value of bullion in great britain

    not be worth  ounce of pure gold in london but  per cent le  and the exchange
    would be at true par when bill for  ounce standard bullion payable in san francisco
    sold in london for  ounce the different value of the precious metal in different
    country do not depend alone on their respective distance from the mine or on their
    greater or le progress in the art the opinion formerly so very prevalent that
    gold and silver were the only real wealth led most nation to fetter and restrain
    their exportation and to adopt a variety of measure intended to facilitate their
    importation but these even when most vigorously enforced were singularly ineffectual
    the great value and small bulk of the precious metal rendered it not only advantageous
    but comparatively easy clandestinely to export them whenever their relative value
    declined  when say adam smith  the quantity of gold and silver imported into any
    country exceeds the effectual demand no vigilance of government can prevent their
    expoitation all the sanguinary law of spain and portugal are not able to keep
    their gold and silver at home the continual importation from peru and brazil exceed
    the effectual demand of those country and sink the price of those metal there
    below that in the neighbouring country if on the contrarv in anv particular country
    their quantity fell short of the effectual demand so a to raise their price above
    that of the neighbouring country the government would have no occasion to take
    any pain to import them if it were even to take the pain to prevent their importation
    it would not be able to effectuate it those metal when the spartan had got wherewithal
    to purchase them broke through all the barrier which the law of lycurgus opposed
    to their entrance into lacedaemon all the sanguinary law of the custom are not
    able to prevent the importation of the tea of the dutch and gottenburg east india
    company because somewhat cheaper than those of the british company a pound of
    tea however is about a hundred time the bulk of one of the highest price s that
    is commonly paid for it in silver and more than two thousand time the bulk of
    the same price in gold and consequently just so many time more difficult to smuggle  but
    though ineffectual to prevent their egress the restriction on the exportation
    of the precious metal have nevertheless contributed to occasion some slight variation
    in their value in different country the risk formerly incurred by the clandestine
    exporter of bullion from spain is supposed to have been equivalent to about two
    per cent or which is the same thing it is supposed that the restncexchange tions
    maintained such an excess of gold and silver in that v country a to sink them
    two per cent below their value in country having a free trade in bullion in calculating
    the true par of exchange between different country circumstance of this kind must
    be taken into account for to whatever extent bullion in one country may be sunk
    below it value in those with which it maintains an intercourse the nominal exchange
    will necessarily be unfavourable to that extent  it consequently result that whatever
    occasion a rise or fill of the value of the precious metal in one country affect
    to the same extent it nominal exchange with other country if more coin or convertible
    paper circulated in great britain compared with the business it ha t form than
    in other country it relative value would be proportionally le foreign bill would
    sell for a premium the amount of which would measure the excess of the value of
    the precious metal in the foreign market caused by their redundancy in the home
    market and on the other hand in the event of our currency becoming relatively
    deficient it value would be proportionally increased bill drawn on foreign country
    would sell at a discount the amount of which would equal the excess of the value
    of our currency over that of other country    in estimating the quantity of bullion
    contained in the coin of different country a particular coin of one such a the
    british pound sterling is selected for a standard by which to compare the others
    and the proportion between it and them supposing them to be all of their standaul
    weight and fineness is ascertained by experiment a par par of exof exchange is
    thus established or rather it is ascertained change that a certain amount of the
    standard currency of one country contains a much gold or silver of the same fineness

    for subsequent variation in the coin of country trading together by rating the
    exchange at so much above or below par in mercantile language that country by
    comparison with one or other of whose coin the par of exchange ha been established
    is said to give the certain for the uncertain and conversely thus in the exchange
    between london and paris london and hamburg c london give the certain or the pound
    sterling for an uncertain or variable number of franc florin c hence the higher

    rate that is when a bill of exchange for  or  franc payable in paris sell in london
    for l or li and vice versa it is but seldom however that the coin of any country

    the new forest in hampshire erected by william the conqueror and hampton court
    erected by henry viii there is no record which make any certain mention of their
    erection though they are often alluded to by various writer and in several of
    our law and statute ancient historian tell u that new forest wa raised by the
    destruction of twentytwo parish church and many village chapel and manor for the
    space of thirty mile together which wa attended with diver judgment on the posterity
    of william i who erected it forwilliam rufus wa there shot with an arrow and before
    him richard the brother of henry i and henry nephew to robert the eldest son of
    the conqueror wa like absalom suspended by the hair of the head in the bough of
    the forest the conqueror say the  saxon chronicle loved the red deer a if he had
    been their father  and he is said to have visited the slaughter of one of these
    animal with greater severity than murder itself this king is said to have possessed
    in different part of england no fewer than sixtyeight forest besides an immense
    number of chase and park legally a forest can only be in the hand of the sovereion  for
    the sovereign alone ha power to grant a commission to be justice in eyre of the
    forest a chase differs from a forest in being capable of being held by a subject
    in being of smaller extent and subject to the common law and not to the forest
    law a chase also may be comprised within a forest forestlaws are peculiar law
    different from the common law of england before the making of the carta de foresta
    granted by henry iii ad  and confirmed by edward i in  offence committed in the
    forest were punished at the pleasure of the king in the severest manner by this
    charter many forest were disforested and stripped of their oppressive privilege
    and regulation were made for the government of those which remained in particular
    killing the king deer wa declared to be no longer a capital offence but only punishable
    by fine imprisonment or abjuration of the realm still in this charter there were
    some grievous article which however were modified by the clemency of later prince
    and indeed the forest law may now be said to be practically abolished forestalling
    in laic is by statute th and th edw vi c  described to be the buying or contracting
    for any merchandise or victual coming in the way to market or dissuading person
    from bringing their good or provision there  or persuading them to enhance the
    price when there this a well a engrossing which is the buying up of large quantity
    of corn or other dead victual with intent to sell them again and regrating the
    buying up of such commodity in any market and selling them again in the same market
    or within four mile of it wa looked upon a injurious to the public by unnecessarily
    tending to raise the price of provision and accordingly several statute were passed
    prohibiting forestalling under severe penalty statute st edw i enacted that no
    forestaller shall be suffered to dwell in any town who manifestly is an oppressor
    of the poore a publike enemie of the whole comminaltie and countrie who meeting
    grain fish herring and other thing coming by land or by water to bee solde doeth
    make haste to buy them before other thirsting after wicked gaine oppressing the
    poore and deceiuing the rich by the statute of edw vi already referred to it wa
    enacted that whoever should buy any corn or grain with intent to sell it again
    should for the first offence suffer two monthsimprisonment for the second six
    month imprisonment and forfeit double it value and for the third be set in the
    pillory suffer imprisonment during the king pleasure and forfeit all his for good
    and chattel this statute further enacted that no forfar one could transport corn
    from one part to another without a licence ascertaining his qualification a a
    man of probity and fair dealing the very imperfect knowledge of political economy
    that then prevailed led to the belief that the intervention of a third party between
    the producer and consumer tended to raise the price of provision and that corn
    would be bought from the farmer cheaper than from the cornmerchant it may seem
    somewhat strange that though the law thus compelled the farmer to deal directly
    with the consumer yet it in many case prohibited the manufacturer from selling
    his own ware by retail in order that the shopkeeper might not be undersold the
    farmer wa thus forced to carry on two trade  and part of the capital which should
    have been employed in the improvement and cultivation of land wa obliged to be
    kept in his granary and stockyard whereas the cornmerchant by affording a ready
    market for the farmer produce enables him to employ his whole capital in cultivation  and
    the existence of a free competition obliges the cornmerchant to sell his corn
    a cheap a the farmer could afford to do the principle here is the same a in manual
    labour the workman who is wholly employed in one operation accomplishes a greater
    quantity of work and can afford to do it at a cheaper rate than one who ha to
    carry on several operation and in the same way the dealer whose whole stock is
    employed in a single branch of business acquires so easy and ready a method of
    transacting business that with the same capital he can carry on a much larger
    business and so dispose of his good cheaper than if his capital and attention
    were employed in a greater variety of object  if say adam smith  a merchant ever
    buy up corn either going to a particular market or in a particular market in order
    to sell it again soon after in the same market it must be because he judge that
    the market cannot be so liberally supplied through the whole season a upon that
    particular occasion and that the price therefore must soon rise the rigour of
    the statute of edward vi wa very much softened by subsequent statute which successively
    permitted the engrossing of corn when the price of wheat should not exceed s s
    s and s the quarter and statute th geo iii cap  repealed the restriction and penalty
    imposed by previous statute which by preventing a free trade in corn and other
    victual had a tendency to discourage the growth and enhance the price of the same
    this statute however did not declare that these offence should no longer be indictable
    at common law  and hence we find that when in  the price of corn rose to an unusual
    height the clamour against the corndealers wa so loud that one of the name of
    rusby wa indicted for the offence of regrating though he wa not brought up for
    judgment it wa not till the passing of the act th and th viet cap  that the several
    offence of badgering engrossing forestalling and regrating were utterly taken
    away and abolished it declares  that no information indictment suit or prosecution

    sort of wealth for another they denied that it could make any addition to it amount
    at first sight this sophistical and delusive statement appears sufficiently conclusive  but
    a very few word will be enough to demonstrate it fallacy in commercial transaction
    none of the party obtain article of greater value than those they gave in exchange
    for them the cloth with which the english merchant purchase portuguese wine may
    have cost a much a the latter or it may have cost more but then it must be observed
    that in making tie exchange the value of the wine is estimated by wdiat it take
    to produce it in portugal which ha peculiar capability tor that specie of industry
    and not by what it would take to produce it in england were the trade put an end
    to and in like manner the value of the cloth is estimated by what it take to produce
    it in england and not by what would to produce it in portugal hence by tradsophism
    of ing together country obtain commodity which it might not be possible for them
    to produce at home or if possible only at a comparatively heavy cost for what
    it take to produce them in other country under the most favourable cucumstances
    and at the least expense the gain of one is not the loss of another they are universally
    benefited by the intercourse  for their labour being better distributed and rendered
    more efficient they all obtain larger supply of useful and desirable article to
    set this important principle in a clearer point of view let it be supposed that
    in england a given number of men can in a given time manufacture  yard of cloth
    and raise  quarter of wheat and that the same num u a gu  en time  man taacture
    in poland  yard of cloth and raise  quarteig of wheat it is plain that the establishment
    of a free intercourse between me two country would in these circumstance enable
    england by manufacturing cloth and exporting it to poand to obtain twice the quantity
    of corn in exchange for a given outlay of capital and labour that she would obtain
    in return for the same outlay on cultivation at home  and oland would on her part
    be enabled to obtain twice a increasing wealth  w ere the intercourse between
    england and portugal and the west indie put an end to it would require at least
    fifty or a hundred time the expense to produce portwine sugar and coffee directly
    in this country that is required to produce the equivalent sent to portugal and
    the west indie in exchange for them and no outlay however great could directly
    supply u with tea spice and fifty other most important article  ihe commerce of
    one country with another is merely an extension of that division of labour by
    which so many benefit are conferred on the human race a the same country is rendered
    richer by the trade of one province with another a it labour becomes thus infinitely
    more divided and more productive than it could otherwise have been  and a the
    mutual interchange of all those commodity which one province ha and another want
    multiplies the accommodation and comfort of the whole and the country becomes
    thus in a wonderful degree more opulent and happy so the same beautiful train
    of consequence is observable in the world at large that vast empire of which the
    different kingdom may be regarded a the province in this magnificent empire one
    province is favourable to the production of one specie of produce and another
    province of another by their mutual intercourse mankind are enabled to distribute
    their labour a best fit the genius of each particular country and people the industry
    of the whole is thus rendered incomparably more productive and every specie of
    necessary useful and agreeable accommodation is obtained in much greater abundance
    and with infinitely le expense mill commerce defended p  j  lo enter into a more
    enlarged discussion of this interesting and important subject would be inconsistent
    alike with the object and limit of this article in the article on colony and the
    corn law and corn trade we have examined the policy of the restriction on the
    colonial and coin tiades and in the article exchange we have pointed out the circumstance
    which regulate the importation and exportation of the precious metal and have
    shown that instead of an excess of export over import being any criterion of an
    advantageous commerce it is quite the levelse and that it is by the excess of
    the import over the export that the gain of the merchant and consequently of the
    community is to be estimated in the fourth book of the wealth of nation adam smith
    ha examined and refuted the various argument in favour of restriction on commerce
    in the most able and masterly manner and with an amplitude of illustration which
    leaf little to be desired a very complete exposure of the sophism of the french
    economist on the subject of commerce may be found in the pamphlet of mill commerce
    defended and colonel torrens economist refuted in answer to spences pamphlet entitled
    britain indepeiident of commerce and ample information on most point relating
    to the practice theory and history of commerce will be found in the principle
    of political economy th edition and in the commercial dictionary by the author
    of this article when the division of labour wa first introduced commodity were
    universally bartered for each other but a the division of employment wa extended
    and exchange became more numerous it became obvious that it would be highly advantageous
    to use some one article a a common medium of exchange a an equivalent for all
    other article and a a standard by which to ascertain their value it is unnecessary
    however to inquire into this subject it ha been already fully discussed in  much

    english manufactured good result no le from the superiority of their fabric than
    from their greater cheapness and for both these advantage we are principally indebted
    to the excellence of our machinery there are other consideration which equally
    illustrate the extreme importance of the accumulation and employment of capital
    setting aside the variation of harvest the produce of the land and labour of a
    nation cannot be increased otherwise than by an increase in the number of it labourer
    or of their productive power but without an increase of capital it is in most
    case difficult to employ additional workman with advantage if capital be not augmented
    and if the food and clothes destined for the support of the labourer and the tool
    and machine with which they are to work be all required for the maintenance and
    efficient employment of those in existence at this or any other period there can
    be no advantageous demand for more in such circumstance the rate of wage cannot
    rise and if the number of inhabitant be increased they can hardly fail to be worse
    provided for neither can the productive power of the labourer be considerably
    augmented without a previous  production of wealth increase of capital for it
    is only by their better education and training by the greater subdivision of their
    employment or by an improvement of machinery that the productive power of workman
    are ever materially increased and in almost all these case additional capital
    is required when the work to be done consists of a number of part to keep every
    man constantly employed in a particular part requires a larger stock than where
    every man is occasionally employed in different part  when say adam smith  we
    compare the state of a nation at two different period and find that the annual
    produce of it land and labour is evidently greater at the latter than at the former
    that it land are better cultivated it manufacture more numerous and more flourishing
    and it trade more extensive we may be assured that it capital must have increased
    during the interval between these two period and that more must have been added
    to it by the good conduct of some than had been taken from it either by the private
    misconduct of others or by the public extravagance of government wealth of nation
    p  it is therefore apparent that no country can ever reach the stationary state
    so long a she continues to add to her capital while she doe this she will have
    an increasing demand for labour and will be constantly augmenting the mass of
    necessary luxury and convenience and consequently also the number of her people
    but with every diminution of the rate at which capital may have been accumulating
    the demand for labour will decline when no addition are made to capital no more
    labour will be or at least can be beneficially employed and should the national
    capital be diminished the condition of the great body of the people would be deteriorated
    for the wage of labour would be reduced and pauperism with it attendant train
    of vice misery and crime would begin to spread it ravage throughout the largest
    portion of society having thus endeavoured to point out the vast importaccumulaance
    of the employment of capital and the manner in tion of ca which it cooperates
    in production we proceed to exp ita  plain the circumstance most favourable for
    it accumulation now a capital is nothing but the accumulated advantage produce
    of bygone industry it is evident that it increase of high will cceteris paribus
    be greatest where industry is mostp rofits productive or in other word where the
    profit of slock are highest a man who produce a bushel of wheat in two day may
    accumulate twice a fast a a man who either from a deficiency of skill or from
    having to cultivate a bad soil ha to labour four day to produce the same quantity
    and capitalist who invest stock so a to yield a profit of ten per cent have it
    equally in their power to accumulate twice a fast a those who can only obtain
    five per cent on their outlay experience too show that while large profit afford
    greater mean of saving they act a incentive to accumulation hence it is found
    that in the country which are making the greatest progress the rate of profit
    is always comparatively high in australia and the united state for example it
    is usually twice a high a in great britain or france  and it is to this that the
    more rapid advancement of the former in wealth and population is mainly to be
    ascribed we do not mean to say that high profit are necessarily and in every instance

    amount moderate seignorage on coined money principle which should regulate it
    reason why a the government of most country have retained the power of coining

    coin of different denomination were individual permitted to issue them at pleasure

    of the exchange becoming unfavourable or of gold becoming a suitable article of
    export and if a adam smith ha observed it became necessary on any emergency to
    export coin they would most likely be reimported abroad they are worth only so
    much bullion while at home they are worth this much plus the expense of coinage
    there would therefore be an obvious inducement to bring them back and the supply
    of currency would be maintained at it proper level without it being necessary
    for the mint to issue fresh coin besides relieving the country from the useless
    expense of coining money sent abroad a an article of commerce a moderate seignorage
    would either prevent or materially lessen that fusion of the heavier coin which
    always take place whenever a currency becomes degraded or deficient in weight
    previously to the recoinage of  the weight of bullion contained in the greater
    number of the gold coin in circulation wa reduced nearly two per cent below the
    mint standard and of course the price and also a a mean of increasing the national
    revenue of gold bullion estimated in this degraded currency rose much difference
    of opinion ha however existed in two per cent or from d it mint price to regard
    to the policy of imposing a tax on coin it ha  per ounce this however wa too minute
    a difference been contended that they ought in no circumstance to to be taken
    into account in the ordinary business of be charged with any duty but that the
    expense of the buying and selling and the possessor of coin fresh mint should
    always be defrayed by the public in this from the mint or of full weight not obtaining
    more proopinion we cannot concur the reasoning of adam duce in exchange for them
    than for the lighter coin smith in favour of a moderate seignorage appears to
    be sent the former to the meltingpot and sold them a quite unanswerable a sovereign
    is more serviceable bullion but it is easy to see that this fusion would than
    a piece of pure unfashioned gold bullion of the same have been prevented had the
    coin been laden with a weight for while it is equally well fitted for being used
    seignorage of two per cent the heavy coin could not in the art it is which bullion
    is not money or legal then have been melted without losing the value given tender
    in imposing a duty or seignorage on coin to them by the seignorage and this being
    equal to the defray the expense of coinage government merely get excess of the
    market price of bullion above the mint back the equivalent of the additional value
    conferred by price nothing would have been gained by the melter the process on
    the bullion and the truth is that those had the seignorage been le than two per
    cent the who carry gold to the mint would have no better reason average degradation
    of the coin had it for example been for complaint were they charged with the expense
    of it only one per cent all those coin whose value wa not coinage than they would
    have had they sent it to a more than one per cent degraded below their mint staniewellers
    that they were charged with expense of it dard might have been melted but if the
    seignorage la manufacture into plate exceeded two per cent no coin would have
    been melted but there are other reason why a seignorage ought until the degradation
    had increased to the same or a to be exacted wherever the expense of coinage is
    greater extent    defrayed by the state gold or silver coin and gold this reasoning
    isbottomed on the supposition that the or silver bullion are very nearly of the
    same value coin on which a seignorage is charged are not issued in and hence whenever
    it becomes profitable to export the excess if they were the abovementioned consequence

    to the mint by prevent the loss that may thus be occasioned  but these individual
    there is little risk of this happening effort having proved singularly ineffectual
    have been abandoned in this and most other country admitting however that it were
    possible which it certainly is not to prevent or materially limit the clandestine
    exportation of coin it is conceded on all hand to be quite nugatory to attempt
    to prevent their conversion into bullion in this there is almost no risk and the
    security with which their fusion may be effected and the trifling expense attending
    it will always enable them to be melted down and sent abroad whenever there is
    any unusual foreign demand for the precious metal this exportation would however
    be either prevented or materially diminished by the imposition of a seignorage
    or duty equal to the expense of coinage coin being by this mean rendered more
    valuable than bullion it no one we may be pretty well assured would carry bullion
    to that establishment and pay the expense of it coinage unless the coin were thereby
    rendered so much more valuable than the unfashioned metal were government to buy
    bullion and coin money on it own account it might by proper attention avoid all
    overissue suppose the seignorage were two per cent then any given weight of coin
    of the mint standard ought provided the currency be not redundant to purchase

    accommodated to variation in the rate of wage taxation a tax and that it will
    be permanent the question is will wage continue at their former rate or will they
    rise and in this case it is all but certain that they will rise for the comfort
    of all class of labourer would be greatly impaired by the rise of price and those
    who previously to it taking place could barely subsist would be reduced to a state
    of destitution or rather we should say of absolute famine under such circumstance
    an increase of mortality could hardly fail to take place while the greater difficulty
    of providing subsistence would interpose a powerful check to the formation of
    matrimonial connection and the increase of population by these mean therefore
    the amount of the population or the ratio of it increase or both would in all
    likelihood be diminished and this diminution would continue till owing to the
    smaller supply of labour in the market wage were raised to their natural rate
    that is a adam smith ha defined it to such a rate a would enable the labourer
    to obtain not only the commodity which are indispensably necessary for the support
    of life but whatever the custom of the country render it indecent for creditable
    people even of the lowest order to be without if a specific quantity of certain
    article were necessary to the subsistence of the labourer it would directly follow
    that the rate of wage could not be reduced for any considerable period below what
    would procure these article but there is no such absolute standard of natural
    wage their amount depends in great measure on custom and habit the article considered
    a necessary are perpetually changing the labourer of hindostan principally subsist
    on rice those of ireland on potato and those of england on bread and beef in one
    country it is discreditable for the lower class to be destitute of comfortable
    clothing and of shoe and stocking while in others shoe and stocking are looked
    upon a luxury to be used only by the rich in many province of france and spain
    a certain allowance of wine is considered indispensable and in england the labouring
    class entertain nearly the same opinion with respect to beer and porter nor have
    the habit of the people and the standard by which the rate of wage ha been regulated
    at different period in the same country been le fluctuating and various the article
    which custom and habit render necessary for the comfortable subsistence of the
    english aid scottish labourer of the present day are a widely different from those
    which were judged necessary by their ancestor in the reign of elizabeth james
    i and charles i a they are from those which form the ordinary subsistence of the
    labourer of france and spain the standard of wage ha happily been raised and the
    poor have been taught to form much more elevated notion respecting the quantity
    and the specie of the article which it would be discreditable for them to be without
    the natural or ordinary rate of wage is not therefore a fixed and unvarying quantity
    and though it be strictly true that the market rate of wage can never when reference
    is made to period of considerable duration be sunk below it contemporary natural
    rate it is no le true that the one ha a tendency to rise when the other rise and
    conversely the reason is that the supply of labour can neither be speedily increased
    when wage rise nor speedily diminished when they fall and it is on this circumstance
    that the powerful influence which fluctuation in the market rate of wage have
    over the condition of the labouring class principally depends if the supply of
    labour were suddenly increased when wage rise that rise would be of little or
    no advantage to the existing labourer it would increase their number but it would
    not enable them to mount in the scale of society or to obtain a greater command
    of necessary and convenience and on the other hand if the supply of labour were
    suddenly diminished when wage fall that fall would merely lessen the number direct
    of labourer without having any tendency to lower the tax habit or the condition
    of those who survived but in the v actual state of thing no rise of wage can be
    countervailed by an increased supply of workman coming into the market until some
    sixteen or eighteen year after it ha taken place  for there are few branch of
    industry in which an active and skilful labourer can be bred in a shorter period
    duradvaning all this interval therefore the labourer is placed in an t g esfa
    improved situation he ha a greater supply of wholesome rise of and nutritious
    food he ha better clothes and a better vktlt  habitation he is rendered more attentive
    to cleanliness and a he rise higher in the scale of society he learns to use more
    prudence and circumspection in forming matrimonial connection in short his opinion
    respecting what is necessary for his decent and comfortable subsistence are raised
    and the natural rate of wage is proportionally augmented but it is equally impossible
    rapidly to diminish the disadvannumber of labourer when wage fall such diminution
    tages of a cannot a already stated be effected otherwise than by the operation
    of increased mortality or by a decrease in the wa  e  number of birth or both
    but unless the fall were sudden and heavy it would require a considerable period
    to render the effect of an increase of mortality very apparent and it is so difficult
    to change the habit of a people that though the demand for labour were to decline
    it would notwithstanding continue for a while to flow into the market with nearly
    the same momentum a before nor would the proportion of birth to the population
    be materially diminished until the misery occasioned by the restricted demand
    on the one hand and the undiminished supply on the other had been generally and
    widely felt but if the country instead of being stationary were increasing in
    wealth and population the result would be different and a fall of wage would then
    be obviated with comparatively little inconvenience to the labourer in whatever
    way therefore wage may be restored to their natural level when the market rate
    decline whether it be by an increase of demand by an increase of industry or by
    a decrease in the number of birth it can never be the work of an instant more
    or le time is always required in which to allow the new circumstance to operate
    and the new habit to be formed and there is in consequence an obvious risk if
    the fall of wage be considerable lest the opinion of the labouring class in regard
    to their condition and place in society should be lowered in the interval when
    wage are reduced the poor are obliged to economise and should the coarse and scanty
    fare which may in the first instance be forced upon them by necessity become congenial
    from habit there would be no longer a motive to occasion increased exertion or
    the exercise of a greater degree of moral restraint so that the natural rate of
    wage would be reduced this however is seldom or never the case in improved and
    prosperous community in these the labourer are always in the enjoyment ol various
    convenience and luxury  and they generally contrive by refraining from some of
    them and becoming more industrious to meet and defeat a fall of wage or to hinder
    it from having any permanently disastrous influence over their condition it is
    true indeed a is stated by malthus that to whatever extent wage fall the labourer
    have the mean in every state of society of raising them in the end to their former
    or even to a higher level for if they understock the labour market wage will continue
    high notwithstanding the mean of employment should be diminished  while if they
    overstock that market wage will be low how much soever those mean may be increased
    but a mechanical theorem of this sort is more easily laid down than acted upon

    really the case is we think sufficiently evident sugar and tea having become necessary
    and the taste for tobacco and we regret to add spirit being generally diffused
    an increase in their price  occasioned by a tax operates in the same way though
    not perhaps to so great an extent a an increase in the price of bread of house
    or of clothing that is it tends to make the labourer more thrifty and le improvident
    in entering into matrimonial connection  and in this way it contributes to improve
    their habit and to raise wage hence it is found that their condition is rarely
    if ever chanoed for the worse by the imposition of reasonable dutieson the article
    in greatest demand amongst them the duty referred to above have been largely increased
    in great britain since the american war and yet the condition of the poor ha been
    greatly improved in the interval and though other cause have cooperated to bring
    about this desirable result there can be no doubt that their improved circumstance
    and conduct are to some considerable extent owing to the greater economy and prudence
    inspired bv the increase of taxation the like result are seen in other country
    the lower class are extremely well off in holland and yet they are apparently
    very heavily burdened with tax we say apparently for owing to the circumstance
    now explained their habit have been improved and their wage raised through the
    agency of these tax the truth of these statement will appear still more obvious
    if we compare the condition of the lower class in england and holland with their
    condition in the great continental monarchy in which the revenue is principally
    derived from direct tax on land house trade c their superior wellbeing in the
    former is a fact not to be demed they are better lodged better clothed and better
    fed  and though they work harder that ha no injurious influence over their health
    on the contrary the chance of life in england are at least i per cent greater
    than in the country referred to and such but for it humidity would also be the
    case in holland  no doubt therefore there is a vast deal of fallacy in the statement
    so frequently put forth in regard to the operation of tax laid on the article
    principally consumed by the working class their mischievous influence ha been
    grossly exaggerated sometimes through ignorance and sometimes and more frequently
    perhaps from le excusable motif in the great majority of case these tax provided
    they are kept within reasonable limit and judiciously assessed are countervailed
    or more by l corresponding rise of wage or by increased industry and economy or

    the wage of agricultural labour it will not really fall on the farmer or the consumer
    but on the landlord effwyf f i he   conclusion a re correct the immediate effect
    of a direct tax on wage doe not depend on the circumstance of the demand for labour
    continuing stationary but on the mode in which the produce of the tax is expended
    and the principle established in the article pot l i  ca  c n  my show  th at
    when wage are raised either thiough their being taxed or otherwise that rise doe
    not tend to raise the price of commodity or lower rent but form a deduction from
    that portion of the produce of inempif f tab d ur therwise s   he capualist  t
    h  to illustrate it operation suppose that a tax of  ner e zrtf wa f r  that a  kburers
    are    per cent of their earnings to collector apwages ttn f   m of this tax t
    taken from the capitalist it cannot in any way diminish their mean of employing
    labour and it effect will entirely depend on the mode in which it is expended
    if the produce of the tax be laid out on additional troop or sailor it is easy
    to see that it could not be productive of any immediate injury to the labourer
    for were such the case the agent of government would enter the market for labour
    with mean of purchasing derived not from the capitalist but from the labourer
    themselvesand in consequence of this greater competition wage would be raised
    in exact proportion to the additional mean in the land of government or in other
    word to the amount of r e  ax  a  n exa mple will render this apparent suppose
    t  nnn nyn k  pep  m a p arucular country receive a wage e  a year and suppose
    further that government wish to increase the military force and that to get the
    mean of doing so a tax of  per cent or of l is laid on wage ihe consequence will
    be that the capitalist lono ome  int  k   market for labour with the e   employed
    by them in the payment of wage while the agent of government will also come into
    the same market with the l derived from the tax  so that between the two wage

    supposed in paying the wage of additional troop but in increasing the pay of those
    already embodied or of the other unctionaries employed by government it effect
    would e different in this case there would be no additional demand for labour
    the individual receiving the tax would indeed have a greater demand for the produce
    of labour but their greater demand being merely equivalent to the diminished demand
    of the labourer by whom the tax had been paid would make no real addition to the
    total demand of the country and thus it appears that when the produce of a direct
    tax on wage is employed to hire fresh individual for the service of government
    it raise by taking so much labour out of the market the price of the remainder
    in proportion to it amount but when it produce is employed to increase the wage

  text: general observation on taxation erroneous opinion of locke and quesnay respecting
    the incidence of tax on the land smith maxim taxation other value the smaller

    taxation or of the expense of government benefit the public precisely in the same
    way that a diminution of the cost of food or of any useful or desirable commodity
    benefit individual there is no mystery in the manner in which government is supported
    and taxation operates government is not a producer it expenditure is not defrayed
    out of it own labour or property but out of that of it subject it is obvious therefore
    that the greater it expense the deeper must they encroach on the mean of those
    by whom they are paid unless a previously stated they be met by increased industry
    or saving or both but this last though a powerful resource is one which is not
    always to be depended upon and hence the paramount duty of enforcing economy in
    the public expenditure various and very discordant opinion have been entertained
    respecting the ultimate incidence and effect of tax locke in england and quesnay
    and his follower in france and italy contended that all tax however imposed fell
    ultimately on the land this erroneous opinion proceeded from their supposing that
    agriculture is the only productive specie of industry whereas it is in no respect
    more productive than others the truth is that all burden which directly or indirectly
    affect the producer of any article fall ultimately on it consumer a tax on hat
    for example raise their price and a tax on leather raise the price of shoe for
    were it otherwise the profit of the hatter and shoemaker would be reduced below
    the general level and a they would not be satisfied with smaller profit than their
    neighbour they would withdraw their capital from such losing business till through
    the diminished supply of hat and shoe their price had been raised to their proper
    height that is to such a height a would yield the hatter and shoemaker the average
    profit of stock exclusive of the tax there are natural limit however to the extent
    to which tax on commodity can be carried  and their effect differ when they are
    laid on commodity required for the consumption of the labouring class and on those
    exclusively consumed by the higher class but before proceeding to inquire into
    the influence of particular tax we shall make a few observation on the maxim laid
    down by adam smith with regard to tax in general which are drawn up with singular
    judgment and comprehension first maxim  the subject of every state ought to contribute
    towards the support of the government a nearly a possible in proportion to their
    respective ability that is in proportion to the revenue which they respectively
    enjoy under the protection of the state the expense of government to the individual
    of a great nation is like the expense of management to the jointtenants of a great
    estate in the observation or neglect of this maxim consists what is called the
    equality or inequality of taxation second  the tax which each individual is bound
    to pay ought to be certain and not arbitrary the time of payment the manner of
    payment the quantity to be paid ought all to be clear and plain to the contributor
    and to every other person when it is otherwise every person subject to the tax
    is put more or le in the power of the taxgatherer who can either aggravate the
    tax upon any obnoxious contributor or extort by the terror of such aggravation
    some present or perquisite to himself the uncertainty of taxation encourages the
    insolence and favour the corruption of an order of men who are naturally unpopular
    even where they are neither insolent nor corrupt the certainty of what each individual
    ought to pay is in taxation of so great importance that a very considerable degree
    of inequality it appears i believe from the experience of all nation is not near
    so great an evil a a very small degree of uncertainty third  every tax ought to
    be levied at the time and in the manner in which it is most likely to be convenient
    for the contributor to pay it  a tax upon the rent of land or of house payable
    at the same term at which rent are usually paid is levied at general the time
    when it is most likely to be convenient for the contributor observato pay or when
    he is most likely to have wherewithal to pay tions on tax upon such consumable
    good a are article of luxury are taxation all finally paid by the consumer and
    generally in a manner that v   is very convenient for him he buy them by little
    and little a he ha occasion to buy the good  and a he is at liberty too either
    to buy or not to buy a he plea it must be his own fault if he ever suffers any
    considerable inconveniency from such tax fourth  every tax ought to be so contrived
    a both to take out and to keep out of the pocket of the people a little a possible
    over and above what it brings into the public treasury of the state wealth of
    nation mcullochs ed  vol vo p  in a theoretical point of view these maxim are
    alike observacomprehensive and accurate  and it follows were it practions on ticable
    that the burden of taxation should be made to press smith on individual in proportion
    to their respective revenue lnaxims a with an income of l ayear ought to pay ten
    time the tax paid by b who ha only l ayear and the latter ten time a much a c
    who ha only a pittance of l  the state ha been ingeniously compared by m thiers
    to a mutual insurance company where the payment  by the member are exactly proportioned
    to the sum they  have insured or to their interest in the company and so it should
    be with the subject of government it is established for the common benefit of
    allof those who labour whether with the hand or the head of those to whom property
    ha descended and by whom it ha been acquired  and is indispensable to their wellbeing
    and to that of every one else and being so it result that all individual should
    contribute to it support according to their stake in society or to their mean
    practically however it is not possible to attain to anything like perfect equality
    in taxation and provided no tax be imposed in the view of trenching on this principle
    or of making one class or order of people pay more in proportion to their mean
    than others equality of pressure is of inferior importance in this a in most department
    of politics we have only a choice of difficulty and what is absolutely right must
    often give way to what is expedient and practicable it is the business of the
    legislator to look at the practical influence of different tax and to resort in
    preference to those by which the revenue may be raised with the smallest inconvenience
    should the tax least adverse to the public interest fall on the contributor according
    to their respective ability it will be an additional recommendation in their favour
    but in this a in every similar matter the salus populi should be the prime consideration  and
    the tax which is best fitted to promote or least opposed to that great end though
    it may not press quite equally on the different order of society is to be preferred
    to a more equal but otherwise le advantageous tax were smith first maxim restricted
    to tax on property or income it would be a true in a practical a in a theoretical
    point of view equality is of the essence of such tax and whenever they cease to
    be equal they become partial and unjust but in laying down a practical rule that
    is to apply to all tax equality of contribution is a minor consideration the distinguishing
    characteristic of the best tax is not that it is most nearly proportioned to the
    mean of individual but that it is easily assessed and collected and is at the
    same time most conducive or least opposed all thing considered to the public interest
    the truth is that the greater number of tax including we believe every one that
    is least injurious are imposed without any regard to their equally affecting different
    class they consist of duty payable by those who use certain article or exercise
    certain privilege and by those only tax of this sort though not proportioned to
    the ability of the consumer are neither partial nor unfair and pro it is perhaps
    needle to say that the income of the different party are supposed to be perpetual
    or of the same duration

    incapable of violating those of natural justice and who would have been in every
    respect excellent citizen had not the law of their country made that a crime which
    nature never meant to be so p  in consequence of this tendency such duty require
    the employment of a number of revenue officer and a they expose the producer of
    the taxed article to considerable inconvenience and hardship from domiciliary
    visit they indemnify themselves by making a corresponding addition to the price
    of their good but these inconvenience are not after all a legitimate consequence
    of duty being laid on commodity  they are occasioned by their abuse or by their
    being carried to an oppressive extent and even when greatest they are altogether
    inconsiderable compared with those that attach to the lowest tax on property or
    income so long a duty on commodity are confined within reasonable limit the temptation
    which they create to engage in illegal transaction may be very easily obviated
    and it will be immediately seen that duty so restricted are uniformly more productive
    than those which are carried to such a height a to hold out any great encouragement
    to smuggling it may be said that duty on commodity do not fall on individual in
    proportion to their mean of paying them and that while they press with undue severity
    on person with large family or who occupy prominent station they may be almost
    wholly avoided by rich miser and those in obscure station but in taxation we have
    only a choice of difficulty however desirable we have shown that it is quite impossible
    to tax individual in proportion to their income and that any attempt to impose
    an equal incometax must certainly fail and be attended with disastrous result
    we should therefore resort to the best practicable tax  that is to duty on commodity
    and it doe not really appear for the reason previously stated that they can be
    considered a either unjust or oppressive if duty be laid on sugar or wine those
    who abstain from their use will of course escape them surely however those who
    use such article have no good right to complain of this seeing that they may also
    by being equally selfdenying exempt themselves from the duty sect iiinquiry into
    the incidence and effect of indirect tax tax on a  tax on commoditiesit is clear
    that if a duty be particular laid on one commodity and not on others it price
    unless commodity some corresponding facility be at the same time given to it production
    will sustain an equal rise  for if it did not so rise the profit of it producer
    would be sunk below the common level and their business would be abandoned indirect
    but it depends on the circumstance of the commodity being tax of the class denominated
    luxury whether a tax on it will vi  v  fall wholly on the consumer tax on necessary
    consumed by landlord and capitalist or by the wealthier class are wholly defrayed
    by them this however is very rarely the case with tax on such necessary a are
    required for the use of the labourer for they are generally made up to the latter
    by a proportional increase of wage or partly in that way and partly by infusing
    a greater spirit of industry and economy into the labourer hence it is seldom
    possible to predicate at the outset what will be the ultimate effect of a tax
    on such article a enter into the subsistence of the poor inasmuch a that depends
    on a great variety of circumstance which it is very difficult if not impossible
    to estimate beforehand but this is never the case with duty on costly article
    such a coach racehorse and hound picture statue vas and so forth or on article
    consumed only by the rich and the great such duty may indeed and most probably
    will even in their case reduce or limit the demand for the article on which they
    are laid but whether this be so or not the taxed article being wholly superfluous
    and nowise necessary for the subsistence of those by whom they are bought the
    latter have no mean or power by which to shift any portion of the tax with which
    they are charged from themselves to any one else but it is nevertheless indispensable
    that the greatest moderation be observed in imposing such duty for otherwise they
    invariably tempt the wealthier class to evade them by resorting to other country
    and usually also induce some of them to take their capital along with them  ad
    valorem tax on commoditiesan equal ad ad valorem valorem duty were it laid on
    all description of commoditaxes on tie would of course affect them all to the
    same extent and c  ommodi it wa universally supposed down to the publication of
    tie  the edition of the wealth of nation by the author of this article that the
    imposition of such a duty would in no degree modify or change the relation or
    proportion which commodity previously bore to each other but though such a duty
    would affect commodity in the same proportion it would not affect the profit of
    their producer in the same but in very different proportion and it is by the degree
    in which the latter are affected that the relation of commodity to each other
    is determined if all class of producer uniformly employed the same proportion
    of fixed and circulating capital  an equal ad valorem duty would affect them all
    equally and the value of their product a compared with each other would not be
    affected by it imposition but this is not the actual state of thing  different
    sort of commodity are produced by the agency of very different proportion of fixed
    and circulating capital  and hence were an equal ad valorem duty laid on them
    all it would not affect profit equally and would consequently cause a transfer
    of capital from one business to another and a variation in the value of commodity

    abatement in the rent which he agrees to pay to the landlord there is no farmer
    who doe not compute beforehand what the churchtithe which is a landtax of this
    kind is one year with another likely to amount to conclusive however a this statement
    appears on a first view it is only under certain condition and limitation that
    it hold good it ha been repeatedly shown that a very large proportion of the raw
    produce raised in every extensive country is produced by mean of capital laid
    out on the land in the view of obtaining the customary profit of the time and
    without it yielding any rent it must also be observed that the cost of producing
    this portion of the required supply of raw produce determines the price of the
    rest for it is produced under the most unfavourable circumstance and unless it
    producer were repaid their expense and profit it would not be brought to market
    and a scarcity would ensue but when a tithe is imposed it affect of course the
    producer of this portion of the required supply in common with the others inasmuch
    however a they pay no rent it is clear they cannot throw the burden of tithe on
    a landlord and a they would not continue in their business unless they obtained
    the same rate of profit a their neighbour it appears unavoidably to follow that
    either the price of corn must rise proportionally to the tithe or that the former
    supply will no longer be brought to market this last is the view that ricardo
    took of the operation of tithe but however ingenious the same remark is applicable
    to his theory a to smith that it is only under certain condition and restriction
    that it is correct it is clear for example that the effect ascribed by ricardo
    to the imposition of a tithe depends first on the demand for corn or it consumption
    remaining about the same after it is charged with tithe a before and second on
    the tithe being made to affect all or nearly all the land of a country and on
    it being exacted from such foreign corn a may be imported if either of these condition
    be wanting ricardo conclusion will be more or le vitiated the tithe will not then
    occasion an equivalent increase of price nor fall wholly on the consumer the commutation
    of tithe effected some year ago ha made the investigation of these and other question
    connected with tithe of comparatively little interest it is however easy to see
    that when the price of corn or anything else is raised by the imposition of a
    tithe or other tax it consumption is cceteris paribus always more or le diminished
    and it is equally easy to see that if a considerable portion of the land in a
    country be exempted from the tithe which is laid on the residue or if foreign
    corn be admitted duty free the tithe will in the former case be but slightly felt
    while in the latter it will have no sensible influence over price  and that consequently
    it will fall principally or wholly on rent the truth is that tithe or tax on the
    produce of land injurious are more injurious from their indirect operation and
    more operation unpopular from the mode in which they are assessed than of tithe
    from the magnitude of the burden which they lay on the public they are imposed

  text: taxation  indirect tax duty on the sale of land do net fall on the seller
    with a public stamp stating the amount of the duty their ultimate incidence varies
    according to the nature of the deed or writing for which it is necessary to use
    stamped paper adam smith ha said that duty on the sale of land or on the paper
    used in it conveyance from one party to another commonly fall on the seller this
    arises he say from the circumstance of  the seller being almost always under the
    necessity of selling which force him to take such a price a he can get the buyer
    is scarce ever under the necessity of buying he will therefore only give such
    a price a he like he considers what the land will cost him in tax and price together
    the more he is obliged to pay in the way of tax the le he will be disposed to
    give in the way of price such tax therefore fall almost always upon a necessitous
    person and must therefore be frequently very cruel and oppressive p  but though
    smith statement may apply in some rare instance there can be very little doubt
    that in the great majority it is quite inapplicable here there are at all time
    large amount of capital seeking investment  and there is nothing which is so much
    run upon a land or which brings so high a price compared with the rent or profit
    derived from it the converse of smith statement would indeed be much nearer the
    mark and there are really no good ground for thinking supposing the stampduties
    on conveyance were abolished that the price of land would be sensibly lessened
    that the existing system of conveying land is injurious by obstructing it easy
    transfer from one individual to another is admitted on all hand that however depends
    on the difficulty of making up a good title to land and not on the duty laid on
    the paper employed the repeal of the latter would not in any degree facilitate
    proceeding that must be effected by totally different mean by adopting a system
    of registration and perhaps also by giving in doubtful case a parliamentary title

    on the transfer of property should be reasonable and they should affect all property

    ably exposed by bentham in his protest against laiv tax stampduties on the voluntary
    sale of commodity fall like other tax on them wholly on the consumer for unless
    such were the case the commodity would not be offered for sale subsequently to
    the imposition of the duty thus the duty on card and dice newspaper c are wholly
    paid by those who use them such too is the case with the duty payable on license

    is no art which one government sooner  learns of another than that of draining
    monev from tlm pocket of the people p  stampduties were introduced into england
    in  by a statute entitled  an act for laying imposition on proceeding at law the
    duty were at first granted for only nine year and were afterwards continued for
    three year more when they were allowed to expire they were again revived in  and
    have since been gradually and greatly increased duty on succession or on the transfer
    of property from legacy the dead to the living are a very common specie of tax

    by augustus on the roman is the earliest example of such a tax dion cassius lib
    iv informs u that this duty wa laid on all succession legacy and donation in case
    of death except upon those to the nearest relation and to the poor pliny ha given
    some of the reason for this exception  in speaking of the vicesima he call it
    tributum tolerabile et facile hceredibus duntaxat extraneis domesticis grave and
    a little after he add itaque mi that is stranger irrogatum his that is near relation

    ut sua semperque possessa ac deinceps proximo cuique transmittenda cepissent panegyricus
    cap  in addition to these cogent reason for exempting the succession of near relation
    from the vicesima it may be observed that the death of a father is seldom attended
    with any increase and frequently with a considerable diminution of revenue to
    such of his child a live in the same house with him  and when this is the case
    the burdening of his inheritance with a heavy tax must be a serious aggravation
    of their loss but if tax on succession be always paid with much reluctance by
    the child and immediate relation of the deceased it is quite otherwise when they
    fall to distant relation or stranger those on whom an unexpected or remote inheritance
    devolves are glad to accept it on any condition  and uniformly pay such reasonable
    duty a may be laid on it with the greatest goodwill in england a stampduty ha

    have died intestate the duty in both case are a follows viz see table next page
    though sound in principle these duty are assessed so a to be open to two very
    serious objection in the first place those on probate are very decidedly heavier
    when the succession are small and moderate than when they are large and in the
    second place those on letter of administration are heavier than those on probate
    in illustration of the first and most important of these unjustifiobjections the
    probate duty a seen above on a succesable pression of l is l and it follows were

    be were the larger a heavily taxed a the smaller sum it is impossible to say a

  text: taxation indirect tax a reduction of duty the only effectual mean of preventing
    smuggling natural and efficient mode of effecting the object in view  but the
    second ha been most generally resorted to in the great majority of case government
    have attempted to suppress smuggling without reducing duty by establishing a more
    vigilant system of collection and by increasing the number and severity of the
    penalty affecting the smuggler but these attempt have for the most part proved
    signally unsuccessful and it ha been almost invariably found that no vigilance
    on the part of the revenue officer and no severity of punishment can prevent the
    smuggling of commodity loaded with oppressive duty the smuggler is generally a
    popular character  and though we have no desire to become the apologist of those
    who endeavour to defraud the revenue and injure the fair trader it is idle to
    expect that the bulk of society should regard those who furnish them with cheap
    tea gin whisky brandy c a guilty of any very heinous offence to pretend say adam
    smith to have any scruple about buying smuggled good though a manifest encouragement
    to the violation of the revenue law and to the perjury which almost always attends
    it would in most country be regarded a one of those pedantic piece of hypocrisy
    which instead of gaining credit with any body seems only to expose the person
    who affect to practise them to the suspicion of being a greater knave than most
    of his neighbour by this indulgence of the public the smuggler is often encouraged
    to continue a trade which he is thus taught to consider a in some measure innocent
    and when the severity of the revenue law is ready to fall upon him he is frequently
    disposed to defend with violence what he ha been accustomed to regard a his just
    property and from being at first perhaps rather imprudent than criminal he at
    last too often becomes one of the hardiest and most determined violator of the
    law of society  p  see also montesquieu esprit de loix liv xiii cap  to create
    by mean of high duty an overwhelming temptation to indulge in crime and then to
    punish men for indulging in it is a proceeding completely subversive of every
    principle of justice it revolt the feeling of the people and make them take an
    interest in the worst charactersfor such smuggler generally areespouse their cause
    and avenge their wrong a punishment not proportioned to the offence and which
    doe not carry the sanction of public opinion along with it is never productive
    of any good effect the true way to suppress smuggling is to render it unprofitable
    to diminish the temptation to engage in it and this is not to be done by surrounding
    the coast with cordon of troop multiplying oath and penalty and making the country
    the theatre of ferocious contest in road and byelanes and of perjury and chicanery
    in the court of law but simply by reducing the duty on smuggled commodity we must
    seek in this and in this only for an effectual check to smuggling whenever the
    profit of the fair trader become nearly equal to those of the smuggler the latter
    is forced to abandon his hazardous profession but so long a oppressively high
    duty are kept up or which is really the same thing so long a a high bounty is
    held out to encourage the adventurous the needy and the profligate to enter on
    this career we may be assured that an army of excise officer backed by the utmost
    severity of the revenue law will be insufficient to hinder them the truth is that
    the too great severity of these law prevents their execution  it stimulates the
    trader to corrupt the officer to conceal a fraud  and it influence the officer
    to overlook what he would otherwise discover hamilton on the principle of taxation
    p  heavy duty on any description of commodity will occasion smuggling but it is
    chiefly caused by their being laid on commodity in general demand whose natural
    or necessary price is not very considerable it is commonly indirect said when
    a proposal is made for laying a heavy duty on a tax lowpriced article that it
    lowness of price fit it to bear such a duty and that notwithstanding it imposition
    it may duty still be brought to market at a sufficiently moderate rate should
    vary but the encouragement of smuggling depends more on tie therieeof proportion
    which the duty bear to the price of the com modity than on the circumstance of
    it being absolutely mo dity high or low to illustrate this principle let u suppose
    that a taxed commodity a soap cost exclusive of duty lod per lb if a duty of a
    penny per lb were laid on it the inducement to smuggle would be equal to  per
    cent of the value of the article  and if the duty were d the inducement would
    be  per cent and so on now let u suppose that the cost of producing the soap or
    it natural price fall to d a duty of a penny per lb would then make an inducement
    to smuggle of  per cent of it value and a duty of d would make an inducement of
    no le than  per cent and hence it is obvious that in order to prevent smuggling
    a system should be adopted precisely the reverse of that which is generally followed
    in the imposition of tax instead of making duty vary inversely a the price of
    commodity that is instead of raising them when the cost of producing the article
    on which they are laid is diminished and reducing them when it is increased they
    should be made to vary directly a this costrising when it rise and falling when
    it fall disproportionally heavy tax are the great cause of smuggling  and they
    have the further and most injurious effect of preventing it being corrected by
    it natural and proper punishment  that is by the confiscation of the smuggledcommodities
    recourse is in consequence had to extraordinary pain and penalty and all proportion
    of punishment being done away  men who a montesquieu observes  can hardly be considered
    a culpable must be punished a atrocious criminal esprit de loix liv xiii cap  certain
    commodity from their greater bulk from their susceptibility of being impressed
    with a permanent stamp or other cause are le liable to be smuggled than others
    and may therefore be loaded with comparatively high duty but a a general rule
    it cannot be doubted that to prevent fraud the duty should be proportioned to
    the cost of the article on which they are laid sect ivcomparative productiveness
    of high and low tax the argument adduced in the foregoing section are sufficient
    to establish the superior productiveness of moderate tax but the subject deserves
    to be treated at greater length  and a the history of taxation furnishes numerous
    conclusive and wellestablished proof of the soundness of this conclusion we shall
    take this opportunity to bring one or two of them under the notice of our reader
    they may be classed under two different headsthe first consisting of instance

    to study some branch of mathematical science and made considerable progress in
    chemistry and mineralogy he fitted up a laboratory formed a collection of mineral
    and wa one of the original member of the geological society it is known however
    that he never entered warmly into the investigation of these science they were
    not adapted to the peculiar cast of his mind and he abandoned them entirely a
    soon a his attention wa directed to the more congenial study of political economy

    u before robertson had become one of the celebrity of the scottish capital he
    had engaged in historical research sitting in his quiet manse at gladsmuir in
    october  we find him writing to lord hailes for information and book relative
    to the history of scotland a he intended to employ some of the idle time of that
    winter in making diligent inquiry into the period between the death of king james

    preached before the society for promoting christian knowledge and entitled the

    some of his clerical friend from the persecution raised against them by the high
    calvinistic party of the church on account of home tragedy ot douglas that a presbyterian
    clergyman should write a play wa held to be a glaring scandal and outrage and
    the offence wa aggravated by the circumstance that several of his brother minister
    had been present at the representation of the tragedy in edinburgh robertson wa
    not of the number he had early promised to his father that he would never enter
    a playhouse  and though he rejoiced in the success of his friend drama and wa
    delighted with private exhibition of the genius of garrick and henderson he faithfully
    kept his promise home bent before the clerical storm by resigning his living at
    athelstaneford and most of the other clergyman having apologised and explained
    were sentenced by their various presbytery to short period of suspension or were
    only subjected to a rebuke the plea of alleviation put in by some of the offending
    minister are amusingly characteristic mr white of libberton owned the charge but
    pleaded that he had gone to the playhouse only once and endeavoured to conceal
    himself in a corner to avoid giving offence the presbytery suspended him from
    the th of january to the d of february mr steel minister of stair urged in extenuation
    that the playhouse wa at a great distance from his parish and he had no reason
    to apprehend that he would be known not one of the minister dared to justify his
    conduct in attending the theatre and all were much indebted to robertson for the
    robertson judgment and eloquence with which he conducted their defence the incident
    is both an interesting and important one in the history of the scottish church  and
    it served to bring more prominently into notice the talent and principle of the
    rising minister of gladsmuir he wa honoured with the degree of doctor of divinity
    by the university of edinburgh and in  wa appointed incumbent of lady tester parish

    himself to procure a good translation of it into french all party political and

    of scotland in  to enter a a student in the university of glasgow so that he wa
    initiated almost in the rudiment of grecian literature under the able instruction
    of dr moor the wellknown professor of greek and he acquired such a knowledge of
    the classical language a served to constitute him a correct scholar through life
    he pursued his study with so much attention a to obtain the approbation of his
    teacher and the admiration of his contemporary who were delighted with the originality
    and ingenuity of his conversation though he did not himself reflect with perfect
    satisfaction upon the degree of application which he had exerted in his academical
    education he took the degree of master of art in  having studied mathematics under
    dr robert simson and moral philosophy under dr adam smith the example of so correct
    and rigid a follower of the ancient method of rob  demonstration a dr simson must
    unquestionably have exercised considerable influence on his yet unformed taste
    in mathematics  but he seems to have had a natural preference either from the
    constitution of his mind or from some previously acquired habit of thinking for
    the geometrical method for we are informed that  he first attracted the regard
    of dr simson by owning his dislike of algebra and by returning a neat geometrical
    solution of a problem which had been given out to the class in an algebraical
    form with this mode of solution the professor wa delighted though the pupil candidly
    acknowledged that it had been adopted only because he could not solve the problem
    in the manner required of the class in the course of his study he had imbibed
    an insuperable aversion to the pursuit of his original object in the church  not
    certainly from any want of religious feeling or from a dislike to the kind of
    life that wa intended for him but probably from some difficulty that had occurred
    to him respecting particular point of doctrine or of practice he wa therefore
    compelled to provide himself with some other occupation  and he readily accepted
    the offer of some of his friend in  to recommend him to dr blair a prebendary
    of westminster who had formed a scheme for sending prince edward the young duke
    of york to complete his professional education at sea in company with a son of
    admiral knowles  and robison wa to have instructed his royal highness in mathematics

    expedition had never been seriously intended and he readily accepted an engagement
    to attend young knowles a a private tutor when he went a a midshipman on board
    of the neptune of ninety gun with admiral saunders who had the command of a force

    for which he wa perfectly qualified both a a geometrician and a draughtsman he

    attempt to turn his mind to the reconsideration of his opinion a remarkable instance
    of this disposition to get rid of expostulation occurs in one of his letter to
    blair cited by mr burton  whenever say hume  i have had the pleasure to be in
    your company if the discourse turned on any common subject of literature or reasoning
    i always parted from you both entertained and instructed but when the conversation

    it is unnecessary to say anything a the subject ha been so admirably touched by
    sir james mackintosh in his preliminary dissertation that he wa very amiable and
    well merited the admiration of his friend cannot be doubted though the eulogy
    of adam smith uttered in the first freshness of grief at his loss is a sir james
    observes  an affectionate exaggeration  such a praise he justly say can never
    be earned without passing through either of the extreme of fortune without standing
    the test of temptation danger and sacrifice it may be said with truth the private
    character of mr hume exhibited all the virtue which a man of reputable station
    under a mild government in the quiet time of a civilized country ha often the
    opportunity to practise in certain respect hume presented rather a curious contrast
    he wa by no mean the impassive person his general coldness of temperament would
    lead u to conclude and by no mean the unprejudiced person which a sceptical philosophy
    may be presumed to have a tendency to form and which he would fain be thought

    and fortunately are never likely to have any more such absurd account to settle
    between them it is the happiness of our age that englishman would a little tolerate
    the prejudice of johnson a scotchman would thoseof humebut it is in his historical
    writing that hume intense capacity of prejudice appears most signally he who wa
    the most sceptical of philosopher became in fact the most bigoted of historian  with
    this aggravation of his bigotry howeverthat all the act and opinion of which in
    his history he wa so keen an apologist were in direct defiance of the general
    strain of his political sentiment and speculation a disclosed in his political
    essay a to his character a a philosopher his genius will probably be more appreciated
    and it achievement le valued by successive generation of reader his capacity cannot
    be well exaggerated that such a work a the treatise of human nature or the essay

    and ingenuity seldom if ever surpassed but these production are chiefly remarkable

    number may be detected in his writing the fact is that provided he coidd find
    any argument to support the paradox of scepticism which happened to be the theme
    of one essay he did not care how it might be opposed to some other paradox of
    scepticism which wa defended in another essay thus while speculatively arguing
    that neither  intuition demonstration experience nor any other conceivable reason

    severe towards female than among the jew if the father died without heirsmale
    of h  s body and without a will the nearest kinsman on the father side wa entitled
    to claim the estate to the exclusion of any daughter whom he had left if he had
    made a will it should have bequeathed his estate to party bound to marry his daughter
    the mohammedan held that female should inherit a certain portion of whatever their
    father might leave allowing the male a double portion among the roman a somewhat
    different policy seems to have prevailed at all event it wa not till the time
    of justinian that daughter v were placed exactly on the same footing a son with
    respect to the succession to intestate property the germanic nation generally
    with the single exception of the visigoth gave a decided preference to heirsmale
    in regard especially to the succession to land female were occasionally excluded
    from succession to the inheritance under any circumstance and in the case where
    they were more favourably treated it wa almost invariably on their having no brother
    the custom of gavelkind which still prevails in kent seems to have existed previous
    to the conquest and most probably extended over the larger portion of england
    and wale by this custom land within the county of kent unless specially excepted
    by an act of the legislature descend where the father dy intestate leaving son
    and daughter in equal portion to the son to the exclusion of the daughter  but
    in the event of his leaving daughter only they share the property equally among
    themselves this law still exists in the copyhold of the manor of stepney and hackney
    in middlesex and in a few other place beyond the bound of kent the custom of borough
    english by which the youngest son succeeds to the whole of the inheritance on
    the intestacy of the father ha prevailed in stamford and one or two other place
    time immemorial the same custom still exists a to copyhold in different part of
    england but whether previous to the conquest property descended to the son or
    indifferently to both son and daughter the introduction of the feudal system led
    to a change in the succession to property in land and paved the way for the universal
    introduction of the custom of primogeniture some writer have taken a very unfavourable
    view of the influence exercised by this custom in modern time adam smith say  nothing

    be we are of opinion that it ha really no good foundation how much of the enterprise
    and industry of the superior wealth and civilization of modern europe may be ascribed
    to the influence of the custom of primogeniture  it is beyond a doubt that the
    possession from infancy of a competency is of all others the most powerful obstacle
    to energy and enterprise those so situated seldom seek any kind of honourable
    distinction and fold their hand in contentment with the humble mediocrity which
    ha fallen to their lot it is not to be expected that the monied fortune accumulated

    is put into their handsi the sense of inferiority will stimulate them to exertion
    and inspire them with a determination to rise to the same or even to a higher

    and in scienceof everything in a word that communicates splendour and give an
    enduring celebrity to nation while doing so it imbues all class with the spirit
    of industry and enterprise it doe not appear therefore that the objection raised
    against the custom of primogeniture are entitled to any considerable notice it
    is not imperative it is a custom only and not a right and may be defeated in the
    event of the misconduct of the eldest son the personal property of one dying intestate
    shall by this rule be dividedafter the widow proportion is deductedequally among
    all the child  but that the real estate shall go in addition to the eldest son
    there is one respect in which the english law of intestacy stand much in need
    of revision the personal property of the intestate is the first fund for their
    debt although secured upon their estate and it is the surplus only if there be
    any that is divisible among the child this is in all respect a most objectionable
    arrangement when an estate is burdened to it full value the eldest son should
    have nothing to look to save his share of the personal property this is in accordance
    with the law of scotland in that country if the eldest son take the real he get
    no part of the personal estate he is permitted to renounce the succession to the
    real property and have it valued and included in a common fund with the moveable

  text: political political the subordinate part of the science of political economy
    economy have been treated in separate article of this work with the fulness which
    their importance seemed to require i he present article therefore will be principally
    confined to an attempt to define the object and limit of the science to trace
    it progressto exhibit and establish the fundamental principle on which it is foundedand
    to point out the relation and dependence of it different part in doing this we
    shall have occasion to examine some of the more prominent theory advanced in this
    field of inquiry  our object being not merely to lay before the reader what we
    conceive to be a true theory of the science but also to present him with a full
    an exposition a our limit will allow of the doctrine advocated by the more celebrated
    of it professor part i definition and history definition of the sciencecauses

    political economy  is the science of the law which reguof the late the production
    distribution and consumption of the science product and service necessary useful
    or agreeable to man which it requires some portion of voluntary labour to  produce
    procure or preserve this definition ha been framed so a to exclude all reference
    to whatever exists independently of man and may be obtained in unlimited quantity
    without any laborious exertion had such been the case with the various article
    required to satisfy our want and desire political economy would not have existed
    it is the most practical of science for it is exclusively conversant with the
    application the object and the result of art and industry it may indeed be said
    to be the science of value inasmuch a those thing only which may be exchanged
    or bartered for other thing that are either wholly or in part produced by mean
    of voluntary exertion or labour come within the scope of it inquiry an article
    may be possessed of the highest degree of utility or a it is sometimes termed
    of intrinsic worth and yet be wholly destitute of value in exchange without utility
    of some sort or other nothing can ever become an object of desire or demand but
    however necessary an article may be to our comfort or even existence and however
    much it may be in demand still if it be a spontaneous production of nature if
    it exist independently of human agency and if every individual have an indefinite
    command over it it cannot become the subject of an exchange or afford any basis
    for the reasoning of the economist t hough food and clothes are not more useful
    than atmospheric air they posse that value of which it is destitute the reason
    is obvious they are not like air gratuitous product which may be had at all time
    without any exertion  they are obtainable only by labour and a none will voluntarily
    sacrifice the fruit of their industry without an economy equivalent they are truly
    said to posse exchangeable definition worth the word value is we are aware very
    often employed distinction to express the utility a well a the exchangeable worth
    of between article but a these quality have nothing in common value in this double
    employment had better be avoided it is obexchange vious for example that the utility
    of bread and water or and utl  their capacity to appease hunger and quench thirst
    is something fundamentally different from their value or capacity to exchange
    for or buy other thing adam smith perceived this difference and wa alive to the
    importance of carefully distinguishing between the utility or a he expressed it
    the  value in use of commodity and their value in exchange but he did not always
    keep this distinction in view and it ha been frequently lost sight of by later
    writer there can indeed be no doubt that the confounding of these opposite quality
    ha been a principal cause of the confusion and obscurity in which many branch
    of the science not in themselves difficult are still involved when it is said
    that water is highly valuable it is meant that being indispensable to existence
    it ha a high degree of utility or of value in use  for being usually obtainable
    in large quantity with little labour or exertion it ha in most place a very low
    value in exchange but when it is said that gold is highly valuable a totally different
    meaning is attached to the phrase gold is of comparatively small utility but a
    it requires a great deal of labour and expense to bring limited quantity of it
    to market it ha a high value in exchange and is readily accepted a an equivalent
    for large quantity of most other article to confound quality which are so very
    different must evidently lead to erroneous conclusion and therefore to avoid all
    chance of error from mistaking the sense of so important a word a value we shall
    not use it except to signify exchangeable worth or value in exchange and shall
    employ the word utility to express the power or fitness of an article to satisfy
    our want and desire were utility and value identical or were they regulated by
    the same law it would follow that whatever increased the utility of an article
    would also increase it value and vice versa but the fact is completely the reverse
    a deficient harvest add nothing to the utilitythat is to the nutritive powerof
    bread  while by increasing it value and price it add to the privation of the great
    bulk of the consumer and especially to those of the lower and poorer and most
    numerous class and so in every case a xise of value or price is always publicly
    injurious  and conversely were the manufacture of hat improved so that they might
    be sold for half their present price everybody would gain by the change those
    by whom they have been worn would save half their outlay upon them while they
    would be brought within the reach of others who may hitherto have been too poor
    to become their purchaser the discovery of the rule or principle by the application
    of which the value of commodity may be reduced to the lowest limit is a principal
    object of this science for the more their value is reduced the more obtainable
    they become and the greater consequently is the amount of necessary and convenience

    be  the definition science which treat of the production distribution and conof

    those product which posse exchangeable value and are necessary useful or agreeable
    the definition would be one of the least exceptionable but those by whom it ha
    been adopted have given to wealth a different and in general much too extensive
    a meaning they have sometimes for example considered it a synonymous with  all
    that man desire a useful and agreeable but if political economy were to embrace
    a discussion of the production and distribution of whatever is useful and agreeable
    it would include within itself every other science and the best encyclopaedia
    would be the best treatise on political economy good health is the greatest of
    boon and therefore on this hypothesis the science of wealth should comprise the
    science of medicine  civil and religious liberty are highly desirable and therefore
    the science of wealth should comprise the science of politics and so on such definition
    are obviously worse than useless they generate confused and erroneous notion respecting
    the object and limit of the science and prevent the student acquiring a distinct
    idea of the nature of the inquiry in which he is engaged malthus defined wealth
    to consist of  those material object which are necessary useful and agreeable
    to man principle of political economy p  but waiving the objection that may perhaps
    be made to the introduction of the word  material it is too comprehensive to be
    of use atmospheric air and the heat of the sun aie both material product and are
    highly useful and agreeable but their independent existence and incapacity of
    appropriation exclude them a already seen from the investigation of this science
    adam smith ha not explicitly stated what wa the meaning which he attached to the
    term wealth probably indeed his idea on the subject were not very precise but
    he most commonly describes it a the annual produce of land and labour it ha however
    been objected to this definition that it refers to the source of wealth before
    it is known what wealth is and that it includes the useless product of the earth
    a well a those which are appropriated and enjoyed by man i he definition we have
    given is not open to any of these objection by confining the science to a discussion
    of the law which regulate  the production distribution and consumption of those
    product and service which have exchangeable value and are necessary useful or
    agreeable we give it a distinct and definite object when thus propel ly restricted
    the research of the economist occupy a held whicftc j exclusively his own he run
    no risk of wasting libvtime in inquiry which belong to other science or in unprofitable
    investigation respecting the production and consumption of article which cannot
    be appropriated and exist independently of human agency capacity of appropriation
    is indispensable to constitute wealth and we shall invariably employ this term
    to distinguish those product which are obtainable only by the intervention of
    human labour and which may in consequence be appropriated and consumed exclusively
    by their owner a man is not said to be wealthy because he ha an indefinite command

    such object in view would be worse than useless ihe consumption of wealth is indispensable
    to existence but the eternal law of providence ha decreed that it can only be
    procured through the intervention of industry that man must earn his bread  in
    the sweat of his face this twofold necessity render the production of wealth a
    constant and principal object of the exertion of the vast majority of the human
    race it ha subdued the aversion of man from labour given activity to indolence
    and armed the patient hand of industry with zeal to undertake and perseverance
    to overcome the most difficult and disagreeable task when pursued with proper
    diligence these effort seldom fail to attain the end in view and while they furnish
    the bulk of society with ample supply of the article required for their comfortable
    subsistence they afford time for the cultivation of those speculative inquiry

    covet with most ardent desire a the great storehouse of their need and convenience
    the sure bulwark of their state and dignity the universal instrument of compassing
    their design and pleasure and most evident it is that in the natural course of
    thing industry is the way to acquire it to secure it to improve and enlarge it
    the which course pursued innocently and modestly god will be so far from obstructing
    that he will further and bless it for that indeed it would be a flaw in providence
    if honest industry using the mean it affordeth should fail of procuring a competency  but
    when the acquisition of wealth make a part of the order of providence and is indispensable
    not merely to the supply of our necessary want but to our progress in intelligence

    by which it acquisition may be facilitated and the greatest amount of wealth obtained
    with the least difficulty  there are none to whom a knowledge of political economy

    to it in the appendix to his life of adam smith and ha quoted some passage illustrative
    of the advantage of commercial freedom which he say  will bear a comparison both
    in point of good sense and liberality with what wa so ably urged by mr hume twenty
    year afterwards in his essay on the jealousy of trade vanderlint close his pamphlet
    with an argument in favour of the substitution of a territorial tax in place of
    every otheran idea borrowed from locke and subsequently adopted by the french
    economist mr richin   mr richardson an extensive merchant pubardson lished an
    essay on the cause of the decline of eoreign trade this essay ha been frequently
    referred to by adam smith and it deserved his notice richardson is an intelligent
    and decided enemy of restriction monopoly and prohibition to give full freedom
    to industry he proposed that corporation privilege should be abolished and that
    the existing tax should be repealed and replaced by a tax laid on the consumer
    of luxury proportionally to their income the following extract will give an idea
    of the spirit and ability which pervades this essay   in the memoir of de witt
    it is said  that restraint is always hurtful to tradethe reason whereof is plain
    for nature ha given various product to various country and thereby knit mankind
    in an intercourse to supply each others want to attempt to sell our product but
    to buy little or none from foreigner is attempting an impossibility acting contrary
    to the intent of nature cynically and absurdly and a ours is a populous manufacturing
    country might be prejudicial to our interest  for could we raise all necessary
    and vanity within ourselves this intercourse designed by nature would be destroyed
    and then how is our navy our only bulwark to be maintained  p   trade cannot will
    not be forced let other nation prohibit by what severity they please interest
    will prevail they may embarrass their own trade but cannot hurt a nation whose
    trade is free so much a themselves spain ha prohibited our woollen but had a reduction
    of our tax brought them to their natural value only they would be the cheapest
    in europe of their goodness consequently history must be more demanded by the
    spaniard be smuggled v  into their country in spite of their government and sold
    at better price their people would be dearer clothed with duty and prohibition
    than without consequently must sell their oil wine and other commodity dearer
    whereby other nation raising the like growth would gain ground upon them and their
    balance of trade grow le and le but should we for that reason prohibit their commodity  by
    no mean for the dearer they grow no more than what are just necessary will be
    used  their prohibition doe their own business  some may be necessary for u  what
    are so we should not make dearer to our own people some may be proper to assort
    cargo for other country and why should we prohibit our people that advantage why
    hurt ourselves to hurt the spaniard  if we would retaliate effectually upon them
    for their ill intent handsome premium given to our plantation to raise the same
    growth a spain might enable them to supply u cheaper than the spaniard could do
    and establish a trade they could never recover premium may gain trade but prohibition
    will destroy it p  mr richardson applies the same argument to expose the injurious
    influence of the restraint on the trade with france  i allow he say  that britain
    should be always vigilant over the design of france but need not be afraid of
    her power her wise regulation in trade should be the object we should keep our
    eye upon and outdo her if possible or else a she rise we must sink but it is our
    comfort that our remedy is always in our own hand  nor can there be any solid
    reason for the nation paying dearer to other country for good we could buy cheaper
    in france would anywise dealer in london buy good of a dutch shopkeeper for d
    or d when he could have the same from a french shopkeeper for is would he not
    consider that by so doing he would empty his own pocket the sooner and that in
    the end he would greatly injure his own family by such whim and shall this nation
    commit an absurdity that stare every private man in the face      the certain
    way to be secure is to be more powerfulthat is to extend our trade a far a it
    is capable of and a restraint have proved it ruin to reject them and depend on
    freedom for our security bidding defiance to the french or any nation in europe
    that took umbrage at our exerting our natural advantage p  we do not know that
    the impolicy of restriction on the importation of foreign corn ha ever been more
    triumphantly exposed than in the following passage every home commodity in a free
    trade will find it natural value  for though that fluctuates a of necessity it
    must according to the plentifulness or scarcity of season yet for the home consumption
    every home commodity must have great advantage over the foreign a being upon the
    spot and free from freight insurance commission and charge which on the produce
    of land being all bulky commodity must in general be about  per cent and a greater
    advantage cannot be given without prejudice for  per cent make a great difference
    in the price of necessary between the nation selling and the nation buying and
    is a great difficulty on the latter but arising from the natural course of thing
    cannot be helped though it is a sufficient security to the landholder that foreigner
    can never import more necessary than are absolutely required and i presume in
    such case they have more charity than to starve the people the progress of enlarged
    and liberal opinion with regard to commerce seems to have been in no small degree

    it may be said perhaps that however true the previous statement are incomplete
    from no mention being made of credit which we are assured play an important part
    in all industrial operation but this is an entire mistake credit is not capital
    nor even anything real it is merely the term employed to designate the lending
    or transfer of capital by one individual to another the lender is said to give
    and the borrower to get or receive credit no doubt we often hear of this that
    and the other undertaking being carried on by mean of credit but by this is really
    meant that they are carried on by the agency of borrowed capital and speaking
    generally the giving of credit or the lending of capital may be said to be advantageous
    because in most instance the borrower employ it to better purpose than the lender
    when however it is otherwise and capital is conveyed a is sometimes the case from
    the industrious and frugal to the idle and improvident the credit that ha been
    given is plainly injurious and in all case it influence whether for good or for

    any considerable diminution of it amount seldom fails to lessen the comfort and
    enjoyment and perhaps also the necessary of the productive class and to spread
    poverty throughout the land and we also endeavoured to show that the increase
    and diminution of the rate of profit is the great cause of the increase and diminution
    of capital but if such be the case it would seem necessarily to follow that those
    employment which yield the greatest profit or in which industry is most productive
    are the most advantageous adam smith however with malthus and others have objected
    to production this inference d hey allow that if two capital yield equal of wealth
    profit the employment in which they are engaged are equally beneficial to their
    possessor  but they contend that if one of them be employed in agriculture it
    will be productive of greater public advantage we believe however notwithstanding
    the deference due to the authority referred to that this opinion rest on no good
    foundation and that the average rate of profit is the test by which we should
    always judge which employment is most and which is least advantageous a capital
    may be employed in four different waysviz first in the acquisition of raw product
    or secondly in manufacturing and preparing these raw product for use and consumption  or
    thirdly in transporting the raw and manufactured product from one place to another
    according to the demand or fourthly in dividing either into such small parcel
    a may suit the public convenience and supplying them to those by whom they are
    wanted the capital of those who undertake the improvement or cultivation of land
    mine or fishery is employed in the first of these way that of master manufacturer
    in the second that of wholesale merchant in the third and that of retailer in
    the fourth it is difficult to conceive that a capital should be employed in any
    way which may not be classed under one or other of these head it is unnecessary
    to enlarge on the importance of ememployploying capital in the acquisition of
    raw produce and men tof especially in the cultivation of the soil it is from the
    ca p ital in latter including therein mine and fishery that the matter agncul  of
    all commodity that minister to our necessity comfort ture  and enjoyment is originally
    derived the industry which appropriates the raw or spontaneous product of the
    earth preceded every other but these are always comparatively limited and it is
    by agriculture onlythat is by the united application of immediate labour and capital
    to the cultivationof the groundthat large supply of those specie of produce which
    form the principal part of the food of man can be obtained it is not quite certain
    whether any of the principal bread corn a wheat barley rye oat c have been discovered
    growing spontaneously but although this must originally have been the case their
    extreme scarcity and the labour required to raise them in considerable quantity
    prove that we are indebted for them almost exclusively to agriculture the transition
    from the pastoral to the agricultural mode of life is the most important step
    in the progress of society whenever indeed we compare the supply of food and other
    raw product obtained from a given surface of a wellcultivated country with those
    obtained from the same extent of an equally fertile country occupied by hunter
    or shepherd the power of agricultural industry in increasing useful production
    appear so extraordinary that we cease to feel surprise at the preference which
    wa so early and generally given to agriculture over manufacture and commerce and

    part iii distribution of wealth having thus endeavoured to trace the various method
    by which that labour which is the only source of wealth may be rendered most productive
    and to exhibit the relation and dependence of the different kind of industry we
    proceed to the third division of our subject or to an investigation of the law
    regulating the proportion in which the various product of art and industry are
    distributed among the different class of the people sect primary division of the
    produce of industry  value of commodity measured in the earliest stage of society
    by the quantity of labour expended in their production rimary it is evident that
    only three classeslabourers capitalivision of i s t and owner of landcan be directly
    concerned in the uoof p roduction of commodity it is to them therefore that idustry
    a that is derived from the surface of the earth or from it bowel by the united
    application of immediate labour and capital must primarily belong the other class
    if such there be have no revenue except what they derive either voluntarily or
    by compulsion from these three class but although there be no state of society
    in which any class besides labourer landlord and capitalist participates directly
    in the produce of industry there are state of society in which that produce belongs
    to one only of these class and others in which it belongs to two of them to the
    exclusion of the third the reason is that in the earlier stage of society little
    or no capital being accumulated there is no distinction between labourer and capitalist  and
    that in all newlysettled and unappropriated country abundance of fertile land
    may be obtained without paying any rent uantity of in that remote period which
    preceded the establishment hour the  f property in land and the accumulation of
    capital or indole   wllen men roatne d without any settled habitation value  ver
    the surface of the earth and existed by the appropriation of it spontaneous productionsthe
    whole produce of labour belonged to the labourer and the quantity of it required
    to procure different article formed the only standard by which their relative
    worth or exchangeable value could be estimated  if among a nation of hunter say
    adam smith  it usually cost twice the labour to kill a beaver that it doe to kill
    a deer one beaver would naturally exchange for or be worth two deer it is natural
    that what is usually the produce of two day or two hour labour should be worth
    double of what is usually the produce of one day or one hour labour if the one
    specie of labour should be more severe than the other some allowance will naturally
    be made for this superior hardship  and the produce of one hour labour in the
    one way frequently exchange for that of two hour labour in the other  or if the
    one specie of labour requires an uncommon degree of dexterity and ingenuity the
    esteem which men have for such talent will naturally give a value to their produce
    superior to what would be due to the time employed about it such talent can seldom
    be acquired but m consequence of long application  and the superior value dtheir
    produce may frequently be no more than a reasonable compensation for the time
    and labour which must be spent in acquiring them in the advanced state of distribusociety
    allowance of this kind for superior hardship and superior skill are commonly made
    in the wage of labour wealth and something of the same kind must probably have
    taken place in the earliest and rudest period  in this state of thing the whole
    produce of labour belongs to the labourer and the quantity of labour commonly
    employed in acquiring or producing any commodity is the only circumstance which
    can regulate the quantity of labour of other commodity which it commonly ought
    to purchase command or exchange for wealth of nation p  thus far there is no room
    for doubt or difference of opinion where there are none but labourer they only
    can share in it produce and the quantity of labour required to produce article
    or procure service form the only standard by which their value is estimated it
    is at this point therefore that the investigation of the law which regulate the
    division of the produce of industry among the three great class of labourer capitalist
    and landlord should properly begin  and we shall commence it by endeavouring in
    the first place to acquire a knowledge of the law which determine the value of
    commodity in an advanced period of society when circulating and fixed capital
    are employed in their production and when land is appropriated and rent paid a
    previous acquaintance with these law is necessary to ascertain the principle which
    regulate their distribution sect preliminary considerationsequality of wage and
    profitsinquiry into the effect of variation of demand and supply on value and
    price cost of production shown to be their regulating principle if the popular
    opinion on this subject were well founded prelimithe inquiry on which we are about
    to enter might be disnai  con posed of in a few word ihe value of commodity when
    serum don compared with each other and their value or price when compared with
    money is held almost universally to depend on their abundance or scarcity in the
    market compared with the demand but though this statement ha some it ha but a
    very small admixture of truth and it will be found that the price of commodity
    are determined speaking generally by the cost of their productionthat is by the
    quantity of labour required to produce them and bring them to market before however
    we proceed further it may be proper the better to facilitate our investigation
    in this and the following section to premise that wherever industry is free the
    rate of wage earned by the labourer in specified department and the rate of profit
    derived from the capital vested in them cannot for any considerable period taking
    everything into account either fall below or rise above the rate of wage and profit
    accruing to the labourer and capitalist engaged in other department with regard
    to the first of these position or the equality equality of of the wage earned
    by those engaged in different employthe wage ments it is not meant to infer that
    all labourer receive earned b y precisely the same sum of money or the same proportion  e
    labour  of the produce of their labour such an opinion would be indifferent equally
    at variance with fact and with principle wage branch of are a compensation made
    to the labourer for the exertion industry of his physical power or of his skill
    or ingenuity they therefore vary according to the greater intensity of the labour
    to be performed and to the degree of skill and ingenuity required wage would not
    be equal if a jeweller or engraver for example received no more than a common
    farmservant or scavenger a long course of trainiim is required to instruct a man
    in the business of jewellery and engraving and if this were not compensated by
    a higher rate of wage none would choose to learn such

    to continue till wage have found their just and true level besides this prominent
    cause of apparent inequality wage vary in amount proportionally to the ease and

    of employment in the greater number ot manufacture a journeyman may except in
    period of general distress usually obtain constant employment but there are several
    business such a those of mason and bricklayer that can neither be carried on in
    hard frost nor foul weather their earnings should therefore be sufficient not
    only to maintain them while they are employed but also while they are idle and
    to make them some compensation for those anxious and desponding moment which the
    thought of so precarious a situation must sometimes occasion hence say smith  where
    the computed earnings of the greater part of manufacturer are nearly upon a level
    with the daywages of common labourer those of mason and bricklayer are generally
    from a half more to double those wage where common labourer earn four and five
    shilling a week mason and bricklayer frequently earn seven and eight and where
    the former earn nine or ten a in london the latter commonly earn fifteen and eighteen
    wealth of nation p  but these variation instead of being inconsistent with the
    principle we have been endeavouring to establish plainly result from it wage are
    not equal when each workman earns the same number of shilling or of penny in a
    given space of time but when each is paid in proportion to the severity of the
    labour he ha to perform the degree of pievious education and of skill that it
    requires and the other cause of variation so long indeed a competition is allowed
    to operate without let or hindrance of any kind or a every one may employ himself
    a he plea the higgling of the market will always adjust the rate of wage on the
    principle now mentioned and it will in reality be neaily equal in different employment
    if it were depressed in one department below the common level labourer would leave
    it to go to others and if it were raised above it labourer would be attracted
    from the department where wage were lower until the increased supply had sunk
    hem to their just level a period of greater or le duration according to the circumstance
    of the country at the time is always required to bring about this equalization
    but all theoretical inquiry and such a have the establishment of principle for
    their object either are or should be founded on period of average duration  and
    when such is the case we may always without occasioning any error of consequence
    assume that the wage earned in different employment are all thing considered about
    equal in like manner the profit accruing to the undertaker of different business
    varies proportionally to the greater or le risk and other circumstance affecting
    the capital which is employed in them it is obvious indeed that distribution of
    wealth equality of the profit of the capital employ ed in different busiprofits
    have not attained their proper level until they have been adjusted so a to balance
    these advantage and disadvantage none would engage in unusually hazardous undertaking
    did the capital which they employ only yield the same profit that might be obtained
    by employing it in more secure business none will voluntarily place their fortune
    in situation of comparative danger extraordinary risk must be compensated and
    hence the wellknown distinction between gross and nett profit gross profit varies
    according to the risk respectability and agieeableness of different employment
    whereas nett profit is the same or nearly the same in them all a gunpowder manufacturer
    for example must obtain a much profit over and above that which is obtained from
    the securest business a will suffice to guarantee or insure his capital from the
    extraordinary risk to which it is exposed in a business of such extreme hazard
    were he to obtain more than this amount additional capital would be attracted
    to the business and were he to obtain le capital would be withdrawn from it the
    everacting principle of competition or which is the same thing the selfinterest
    of every individual will not permit the wage or profit of any particular set of
    workman or capitalist taking all thing into account to continue either long below
    or long above the common and average rate of wage and profit obtained by those
    who are employed or have capital vested in other business it is by this common
    standard that the wage and profit of particular business are always regulated
    they never diverge considerably from it they have a constant tendency to equalization  and
    may in theoretical inquiry be supposed without occasioning any erroi of consequence
    exactly to coincide the equality or rather the constant tendency to equality of
    the wage earned by the labourer and of the profit derived from the capital employed
    at the same time in the various branch of industry wa pointed out by harris and
    also by cantillon in his work entitled the analysis of trade c published in  but
    it wa first fully demonstrated in the eighth ninth and tenth chapter of the first
    book of the wealth of nation i he establishment of this principle wa one of the
    greatest service rendered by adam smith to the science nothing can be more convincing
    and satisfactory than his reasoning on this subject the equality of wage and of
    profit ha since the publication of his work been always assumed a admitted and
    incontestible the equality of wage and profit once established it is variation
    easy to see that variation in the demand and supply of of demand commodity can
    exert no lasting influence over price nsupp v the cost of production denominated
    by smith and the p emarient marquis garnier necessary or natural price is the
    ultimate in fl uenc e regulator of the value of every commodity not subject to
    a on price monopoly of which the quantity may be indefinitely increased by the
    application of fresh capital and labour to it production the market price of such
    commodity and their cost do not always coincide  but they cannot for any considerable
    period be far separated and have a constant tendency to equality commodity will
    not continue to be produced if they sell for le than the cost of their production  that
    is for le than will repay the outlay upon them including the ordinary rate of
    profit on the capital employed this is a limit below which it is plain price cannot
    be permanently reduced and it is equally plain that were they for any considerable
    period to rise above it additional capital would be attracted to the advantageous
    business and the competition of the producer would lower pi ice a demand to be
    effectual must be such a will cover the expense of production if it be insufficient

  text: political economy distribuj ie produce of anterior labour that it accumulation
    and employment is consistent with or rather is embodied in the proposition that
    the value of commodity depends on the labour required for their production a commodity
    may be altogether produced by capital without the cooperation of any immediate
    labour and it so it value will be determined by the quantity of capital that is
    of antecedent labour expended on it production or it may be partly produced by
    capital and partly by immediate labour and then it value will be proportioned
    to the sum of the two or which is the same thing to the total amount of labour
    bestowed upon it the principle now laid down are almost selfevident and have been
    generally assented to but a considerable difference of opinion is entertained
    respecting the influence which the employment of workman by capitalist and the
    fluctuation in their wage have over value it doe not however seem that there is
    much room for ployment these difference suppose that a certain quantity of good
    of workga y twenty pair of stocking manufactured by independent ttalisi   workman
    freely exchange for forty pair of glove also doe not manufactured by independent
    workman  they would conraise the tinue to be exchanged on this footing provided
    the quanprice of tity of labour required for their production continued uncommodichanged
    though the workman should be employed by tie  master manufacturer in the first
    case it is true a adam smith ha observed that the good produced by the workman
    belong wholly to themselves and that in the second case they have to share them
    with others but it must be recollected that in the first case the capital made
    use of in their production also belonged to the workman and that in the latter
    case it ha been supplied to them by others the question then come to bedoes the
    circumstance of labourer voluntarily agreeing to give a portion of the commodity
    produced by them a an equivalent or compensation for the use of capital supplied
    to them by others afford any ground for raising the price of such commodity  it
    is evident it doe not the profit of stock are only another name for the wage of
    accumulated labour they enter into the price of every commodity in the production
    of which any portion of capital ha been expended but whether the capital belong
    to the labourer or is furnished to him by another is obviously of no consequence
    w hen the capital doe not belong to the labourer the commodity he produce are
    divided into txoo portion whereof one is the return for the immediate labour and
    the other for the capital or accumulated labour required for their production
    but the value of the produce is the same into how many portion soever it may be
    divided a shoemaker who manufacture shoe on his own account obtains the same profit
    on their sale that would accrue to the mastershoemaker who should employ him a
    a workman he must have capital to maintain himself and his family until his shoe
    are disposed of to provide himself with a workshop and tool to advance money to
    the tanner to pay his leather and to meet other outgoings if he did not exclusive
    of the ordinary wage of labour realise a profit or a return for his capital equal
    to the profit obtained by the mastershoemaker it would be for his advantage to
    lend his capital to the latter and to work on his account and it is plain inasmuch
    a his shoe would not sell for a higher price than those of the capitalist that
    he could not realise a greater profit it is immaterial therefore whether the accumulated
    labour or capital and the immediate labour employed in the production of commodity
    be furnished by the same or by different party it is by the total quantity of
    labour necessarily expended upon them and not by the channel through which it
    is supplied that their value is determined it now only remains to trace the influence
    of fluctuation the eniof wage on price when this is done the subject will be distribuexhausted
    ton of to simplify this inquiry we shall divide it into two wealth branch we shall
    inquire first whether fluctuation of wage have any and if any what effect on the
    value of effect of commodity produced by the aid of capital of equal degree aquations
    j of durability  and second whether these fluctuation have e rate any and if any
    what effect when the capital employed exchange are of unequal degree of durability
    able i when all class of producer employ fixed or circuvalue lating capital of
    the same degree of durability they must  effect of i i be all equally affected
    by a rise or fall of wage this j principle is admitted by every one and is indeed
    selfeviw heuhe dent but when such is the case it is plainly impossible capital
    that a rise or fall of wage should occasion any variation in employed the value
    of commodity to revert to our former exin producample  let it be supposed that
    wage at the rate of a shilling are of a day were paid by the stocking manufacturer
    a pair of whose stocking exchanged for two pair of glove and durability that from
    some cause or other the wage of his workpeople have been doubled or raised to
    two shilling the question is will he now obtain a greater quantity of glove for
    his stocking  it is obvious he will not he cannot urge the fact of his having
    to pay higher wage a a reason why the glove manufacturer should give him more
    glove in exchange for stocking for the latter would have it in his power to reply
    that the same rise of wage affected him to precisely the same extent if therefore
    one pair of stocking were previously worth two pair of glove they would continue
    to preserve that relation so long a the quantity of labour required for their
    production did not vary whatever might be the fluctuation of wageswhether they
    fell to a sixpence or rose to five shilling a day even if the price of commodity
    rose which it doe not when wage rise that would be no advantage to the producer
    commodity are always bought by commodity or by labour of what consequence then
    would it be to a capitalist to sell when wage rose his commodity at an equal advance
    seeing that he in his turn would be obliged to give so much more for every article
    which he ha to purchase  were wage to rise ten per cent a producera hatter for
    examplewould be in precisely the same condition whether he sold his hat for ten
    per cent advance and gave an additional ten per cent a he would be obliged to
    do for his food shoe clothes c c or sold his hat at their former price and bought
    the article for which he ha occasion at the price he formerly paid for them in
    order farther to illustrate this principle we may be allowed to make a supposition
    which though it cannot actually take place will serve to set this doctrine in
    a clearer point of view should the quantity of labour required for the production
    of all sort of commodity be increased in exactly the same proportion their exchangeable
    value would plainly remain unaltered their cost would however be augmented a bushel
    of corn would not then exchange for a greater quantity of muslin or of broad cloth
    than it did before the increased expense of it production  but each would be the
    produce of more than the former quantity of labour under such circumstance the
    price of commodity would remain stationary while the wealth and comfort of the
    society would be materially diminished every person would have to make greater
    exertion to obtain a given supply of any one commodity  but a the expense of producing
    all commodity is by the supposition equally increased it would not be necessary
    to make any greater exertion to obtain one than another and their value a compared
    with each other would be totally unaffected in these statement it is taken for
    granted that the value of money ha been invariable but if it become either more
    or loss valuable then undoubtedly the rate of

    this difficulty is got over the occupier of the ground forthwith endeavour to

    it exceeds these limit that is when it is greater than the consumer can afford

    to this or that description or specie of article bu except in case where credit
    ha been obtained through fraudulent representation this is a fault which may be
    safely left to be dealt with by those concerned the poverty and degradation that
    are sure to result from reckless consumption is a sufficient guarantee against
    it being carried to an injurious extent to attempt to lessen it by proscribing
    luxury is like attempting to enrich a country by taking away some of the most

    time at least after that labour is past the second of those whose labour leaf
    nothing in existence duetive     after the moment of exertion but perishes in
    the act ofconsumpperformance the former are said by smith to be protioaductive
    the latter miproductive labourer not that in making this distinction he meant
    to undervalue the service rendered by the latter or to deny that they are frequently
    indispensable but he contends that how advantageous soever these service not having
    any result of a fixed and transferable character add nothing to the wealth of
    a country and that consequently the labour of those by whom they have been rendered
    ha been unproductively expended to avoid however all chance of misrepresentation
    we shall give smith opinion in his own word  there is one sort of labour say he  which
    add to the value of the subject upon which it is bestowed there is another which
    ha no such effect the former a it produce a value may be called productive the
    latter unproductive labour thus the labour of a manufacturer add generally to
    the value of the material which he work upon that of his own maintenance and of
    his master profit the labour of a menial servant on the contrary add to the value
    of nothing though the manufacturer ha his wage advanced to him by his master he
    in reality cost him no expense the value of those wage being generally restored
    together with a profit in the improved value of the subject upon which his labour
    is bestowed but the maintenance of a menial servant never is restored a man grows
    rich by employing a multitude of manufacturer he grows poor by maintaining a multitude
    of menial servant the labour of the latter however ha it value and deserves it

    in excess lias been scanty rather than otherwise and without a diminution of the
    former or an increase of the latter most people amongst u will be but little sensible
    of the influence of calilbrnian and australian gold the previous statement seem
    to be sufficient to show that the present supply of the precious metal is not
    more than adequate to meet the existing demand and thattherefore there is no ground
    for anticipating a fall in their value unless the supply should be increased or
    the demand diminished it is now ten year since the increased supply of gold from
    california and seven since those from australia have been poured into the market
    of europe and america and yet there ha not during that period been anything like
    a general rise of price on the contrary the price of most article are a low at
    this moment december  a they were at the same time in  while several are a good
    deal lower and of the few that have risen in price since the latter epoch there
    is not one of which the rise may not be satisfactorily explained by something
    peculiar to itself and affecting either it demand or the condition of it supply
    or both thus the rise that ha taken place in the rate of wage in great britain
    and in ireland is wholly ascribable partly to the greater demand for labour partly
    to the extent to which emigration ha been carried and partly to the potato rot
    and the consequent famine in ireland there is in truth nothing whatever in comparing
    the price of today with those of ten year ago to entitle any one to affirm that
    the value of gold and silver ha undergone the smallest change in the interval
    it ha been attempted to show that gold ha fallen in value by alleging that the
    value of silver a compared with it ha increased but a rise may take place in the
    comparative value of silver without it being occasioned by a corresponding fall
    in the value of gold the value of silver is affected by a variety of circumstance
    peculiar to itself and if it have really increased during the last half dozen
    year such increase may be satisfactorily accounted for by the extraordinarily
    increased demand for it in the east it is however very doubtful whether there

    at an average of the entire period there ha been no sensible variation ihat there
    is but little probability that price will be raised by a continuance of the present
    supply of gold and silver may be inferred from what took place after the discovery
    of america in  it appears from the research of adam smith  and other authority
    that the influx of the piecious metal had exerted it full effect upon price previously
    to or about  and yet this influx wa much greater then and subsequently than it
    had been at any previous period according to the best information attainable the
    average annual importation of the precious metal from america into europe from  down
    to  may be estimated a follows  from  to  l a year                                    annual
    average of the entire period  l in  or  when the bullion of america had produced
    it full effect on price in europe it annual influx amounted to about l and yet
    though it influx wa nearly trebled between that epoch and  it is admitted on all
    hand that down to the lastmentioned year there wa no general rise of price  the
    increased demand of europe wa fully sufficient to take off this great increase
    of supply without any fall taking place in the value of silver indeed it is contended
    by some high authority that instead of falling it rose in value during the period
    referred to there can be no manner of doubt not merely that the quantity of the
    precious metal employed in europe and america is incomparably greater now than
    in the seventeenth and eighteenth century but that the demand for additional quantity
    is also incomparably greater and when it is seen that their value continued stationary
    from  to  despite the immense additional supply that were thrown upon the market
    there is it is plain little ground for wonder that their late increase great a
    it ha been ha not affected their value or for anticipating that they will materially
    decline in the course of the next half century should it however turn out that
    we are mistaken in these conclusion and that a considerable fall in the value
    of the precious metal is about to commence it is satistactory to know that there
    are no really tenable a very considerable addition ha been made to the metallic
    currency of the united kingdom during the last ten year owin ioever to our gold

  text: l a law prevent difference by ruling relationship by conti act would be greater
    tbe more they tended to give bii tli to difference it is on this principle that
    the order of the evolution of law is to be explained in transaction between equal
    entered into oy contract appeared a farther approach to law what they agreed upon
    wa the rule of their relationship what wa once satisfactorily the rule of a relationship
    wa repeated if frequently repeated it became a custom or usage transaction not
    provided for by contract fell to be decided ex post facto to these a rule previously
    acted upon if there wa such would probably be applied where there wa no clear
    rule that could be held to be implied or that could be agreed upon ex post facto
    recourse wa had to other mean of settling the matter in dispute a to a reference
    to an impartial person whose decision again influenced future case and the term
    of future contract it is thus the term of decision and of contract grow into custom
    it is worth while considering how far equity enters into rule of law derived from
    contract whose term are privately arranged where the contractor put themselves
    into the position of an impartial person and settle term from his standpoint equity
    directly enters into the term the only case for consideration is where their conception
    of right being modelled on their desire are made to differ from those commonly
    entertained and the rule is reached by a process of double position here either
    the rule of the contract is what bystander approve of or it is not only in the
    former case will it be adopted and passed into custom contract from this source
    then must involve equity to pas into law that they should often do so appears
    from the consideration that in advancing to a rule the contractor are forced to
    recognise equality of advantage a the ideal rule of the contract custom   y e
    i iave seen i w rule of relationship formed in the intercourse of equal pas by
    arbitration and contract into custom in early time only equal would submit their
    difference to the decision of neutral person or consent to rule their relationship
    by contract because only equal had a common interest in obtaining the settlement
    of their difference by these mean equity then entered into all decision and contract
    in early time and thence into the rule of custom derived from them and into law
    so far a it is an organic growth from the constitution and circumstance of a people
    a distinction already hinted at must here be brought out between custom due to
    the intercourse of equal and those due to the intercourse of superior and inferior
    it wa said that from the latter arose no principle for imitation by equal in forming
    relationship between themselves it may now be said that the latter class of custom
    are permissive and not regulating and are only for consideration here a illustrating
    the condition of thing from which law gradually rescue men all the custom that
    shock one sense of justice and humanitythe exposition of infantsthe power of a
    roman father over his childrenare remnant of the condition anterior to law and
    respect act and relationship not rescued from that condition because they lay
    without the sphere of operation of the cause by which law ha everywhere been developed
    ihey are proof of the slowness of men to extend by sympathy to others benefit
    which by force they assert for themselves  hat sympathy is among the cause which
    develop law is certain  but it is only by concurrence with a highly stimulated
    selfishness that it recovers the relation of superior and inferior from arbitrary
    rule it is owing to this that law ha been almost everywhere developed in some
    degree differently with respect to different class of the same people when it
    wa first asserted in city that law ought to be equal for all the claim wa advanced
    only for the class of freeman who were themselves the party making it at first
    w ireplolkoi peregrini immigrant helot and slave of every law kind were disallowed
    equal privilege woman everywhere to this day are without equal right one class
    of our own people reserve the right of being tried by their peer but it is in
    the intercourse of nation who form a yet a rude society that the truth of the
    proposition is most noticeable war is the moderator of the conscience of state
    where success is easy the sense of justice rarely impedes their aggressive tendency
    where it is difficult their morality shuts them up to noninterference in europe
    where the state are interested in maintaining the balance of power an approach
    to equity is made in the regulation of the relation of state great and small but
    outside europein india china japan africathe european state practise the morality
    of superior and gratify every desire however iniquitous in satisfying which they
    are not led into conflict with one another so that the area over which an approach
    to law ha been made in the intercourse of nation is conterminous with that over
    which the sense of a common interest extends and identifies the security of individual
    state with that of all with the widening of that area and the increasing intensity
    of that sense international law will spread and grow nowhere is law local or international
    other than that sense by it direct or indirect operation constitutes it how sympathy
    of itself fails to effect the recovery of the relation of superior and inferior
    from arbitrariness fall not to be explained here whoever appreciates what adam
    smith moral sentiment part i sect  ha written of the dependence of sympathy on
    imagination will have no difficulty in understanding the failure it is in virtue
    of public opinion originating in the experience of what is conducive to the common
    good and mostly supported by the authority of religion that before government
    is fairly established and exercise it judicial and executive function custom acquire
    for the rule which they embody some degree of the force and generality of law
    one of the first institution of government is an agency to give effect to the
    rule of customfunctionaries appointed by the sovereign to act a judge taking the
    place of selfconstituted umpire and arbiter custom customthe when it rule are
    thus administered and enforced by the sovereign is the highest rudimentary form
    of jaw  it is fnot ary surprising say mr james mill  to what an extent oveij avv  the
    surface of the whole globe law ha in all age remained in that state of imperfect
    existence if indeed with any propriety it can be called a state of existence in
    every part of asia in all age law ha remained in that state of existence or nonexistence
    in europe where at a pretty early period it became the practice to record in writing
    the proceeding of the judge the natural propensity of referring to the past a
    a rule for the present begat in time a specie of obligation of being directed
    by the example which had already been set this created a uniformity and certainty
    which however imperfect afforded something better than the arbitrary proceeding
    of asiatic judge yet this wa a benefit which had a dreadful alloy a body not of
    law but of decision out of which on each particular occasion a law for that particular
    occasion a out of the crude ore wa to be smelted hammered and wiredrawn wa the
    natural material out of which to manufacture a system of chicane a system of law
    so constructed becomes an instrument of conservation of the barbarous custom and
    idea of the time in which they were engendered and infests society with the evil
    of an age which it ha left behind of this effect of custom there will be occasion
    to write hereafter by a change of view however it is possible to admire instead
    of deploring that provision of nature by which custom is made to preserve the
    popular experience and thus to accumulate the material which the legislator must
    employ in attempting

    law and morality to perfect the law of his country even under the legisj lators
    superintendence law is apt to grow up somewhat rankly and it is well that it growth
    is so far independent of his care  a civilization advance and government becomes
    firmly established the sovereign judicial function is exchanged for the legislative
    he enacts new law sometimes arbitrarily sometimes on a principle and amends and
    repeal old rule or rear up a homogeneous and systematic body of law out of the
    mass of popular usage thereafter this body receives successive differentiation
    and accretion a popular habit change with new occupation when the sovereign perceives
    that his interest and those of the people are identical and that the subordination
    of individual interest to those of the community is the principle on which legislation
    ought to proceed he make law in greater consistency with one another seek to anticipate
    case and to make law popular and effective by giving it publicity and certainty
    the consideration however of the bearing of sovereignty on the growth of law must
    be postponed until the action of opinion on law ha been farther considered  while
    in the growth of law custom drew in and hugged the accident of the soil round
    the rule of equity opinion based on these but expanding with improving conception
    tended to loosen and remove them it wa at first wavering and divided  then men
    of speculative mind orator poet philosopher and minister of religion gave it precision
    and definite direction by their sentiment and doctrine they refined the rude juridical
    notion of early time and gave rise to the maxim which by approving themselves
    to popular experience established the despotism of opinion which met many necessity
    for which neither law nor the actual power of each individual could provide whoever
    violated the rule approved of by the people had to dread their resentment weakness
    became formidable to power by being armed with the sympathy of mankind the manner
    in which opinion grew up with law beginning to grow with it first germ but rapidly
    shooting in advance of them and thereafter always maintaining itself in the advance
    may be traced in the history of morality  and a the action of morality on law
    is among the chief of the influence determining it development it is particularly
    important that their relation should be understood the rationale of the action
    of opinion on law is of itself simple enough experience at once generated rule
    of action and doctrine respecting conduct and while use and wont and convenience
    preserved the rule reflection and riper experience changed the doctrine the new
    doctrine on being propagated produced popular disposition or fell in with them
    by which they were in turn passed into rule of law realized and fixed in the rear
    of advancing opinion the conception of right and wrong struck out in the intercourse
    of equal were the foundation of opinion respecting conduct a the highest and lowest
    in society had their coequals all partook of instruction in the same principlesin
    the same schoolif in different form we have seen that these conception rested
    on association of legal quality with fact induced by experience of the imprudence
    and inconvenience of preventing these fact operating to vest enjoyment in particular
    person the conception of enjoyment a properly vested in particular person are
    conception of right and the same experience gave birth to these and to prudential
    motif to respect right it thus at once gave birth to morality and law a these
    prudential motif and the rule for the regulation of the desire based on them which
    afterwards passed into moral rule existed from the first only relatively to the
    reality however rude of law morality wa at the first dependent on if not coincident
    with law the argument from another law point of view of dr whewell element of
    morality vol i pp   on the dependence of morality on law when carried back to
    the limit establishes the same position it truth however rest not wholly on an
    abstract argument it is an historical fact that it is some time before morality
    and law are discriminated from one another mr grote point out the fact that in
    the homeric poem only the germ of the distinction between morality and law can
    be detected in a note volii p  he quote nagelsbach ijomerische theologie abschn
    v p  a giving ajust and wellsustained view of the homeric ethic which is to the
    effect that it is their characteristic standpoint that the sphere of legal right
    morality and religiosity are not a yet at all disengaged from each otherso that
    a man for example could be just without being godlybut exist together in undeveloped
    unity they are only conceived of a distinct when by the advance ofmorality law
    stand out by itself a a rule distinct from moral and religious duty this advance
    is due to the fact of law realizing and fixing conception of right in rule of
    custom  while morality freely change and amplifies them by reflection on a riper
    experience than gave them birth on the advance taking place it arose from the
    necessity of moral rule receiving their interpretation from legal disposition
    that morality divided into two portionsthe one steady relative to law and creating
    a disposition to conform to it the other vague and contemplating better or more
    convenient disposition of thing than those realized by law it thus became in a
    twofold sense the auxiliary of law aiding at once in enforcing and improving it
    it is by the rereciprocal ciprocal influence of morality and other advanced form
    ofinfluence opinion and law that the stability of the social progress is of lav  secured
    opinion steadied and excessive inequality in the r allt y development of the class
    of society prevented while criral j t on tical morality tends to improve popular
    conception and law thus to change the rule of law or custom the latter react on
    the former opinion in a state of fluidity in the front of experience is constantly
    washing the law in it centre of the impurity of the soil but these in turn enter
    into opinion and tone and colour it a most noticeable instance of this is pointed
    out by adam smith in the influence of custom on the opinion of plato and aristotle
    regarding the exposition of infant in the view of this reaction must be noticed
    the tendency to finality in moral a affecting the progress of law the temporary
    effect of assigning absoluteness to moral dogma is to increase their authority  but
    the final effect is to disqualify them for carrying on the improvement of law
    critical morality in the critical relative form with the greatest happiness on
    the whole of morality society for it standard of right continues to be the auxiliary
    and guide of law because it aim at no more than investigating rule the true lesson
    of experience which on being discovered the instinct of men compel them to practise
    and in fact since circumstance and convenience determine law and law interprets
    the rule of morality it is impossible to make them absolute or universal except
    in point of form even the moral rulesbe just pure humanewhich being drawn from

    institution of slavery the relation of other form of advanced opinion to the growth
    of law is for a large part the same a we have above indicated a subsisting between
    morality and law the progress effected resulting from the mutual action of opinion
    on law and law on opinion when the progress ha been carried on up to a certain

    there should not be isolated theory the approximate character of their conclusion
    not being lost sight of m comte however contends that the case are not analogous
    and that in sociology the isolation of effect and their specific cause is strictly
    inadmissible such subdepartments of social science have notwithstanding been formed
    for instance political economy is isolated from general social science and devoted
    to the investigation of the law of the creation and distribution of wealthits
    approximation resting on the operation of a single law of human nature that men

    or projected is ethology political ethology mill logic of the moral science the

    or an age this science investigates the effect of institution or social arrangement
    upon national character and conduct and thus corresponds immediately to the legislative
    art sociological problem come in one or other of two form  given a certain general
    condition of social circumstance to determine the effect of a given cause  or  what
    are the law which determine the circumstance themselves sociology a a science
    of tendency answer the first by demonstrating the tendency of particular cause
    under assumed condition of circumstance when the actual condition differ from
    these the practitioner recurring to the principle of the science must endeavour
    to take the omitted circumstance into account or to omit the superlative circumstance
    a the case may be it answer the second by investigating the law by which one state
    of society generates another with regard to the first mr mill is of opinion that
    it would be an error to suppose that by deduction from the principle of human
    nature we could arrive at any great number of proposition which will be true in
    all society without exception  such a supposition he say  would be inconsistent
    with the eminently modifiable nature of social phenomenon and the multitude and
    variety of the circumstance by which they are modifiedcircumstances never the
    same or even nearly the same in too different society or in two different period
    of the same society every cause a it effect spread through society come somewhere
    in contact with different set of agency and thus ha it effect on some of the social
    phenomenon differently modified and these difference by their reaction produce
    a difference even in those of the effect which would otherwise have been the same
    we can never therefore affirm with certainty that a cause which ha a particular
    tendency in one people or in one age will have exactly the same tendency in another
    without referring back to our premise and performing over again for the second
    age or nation that analysis of the whole of it influencing circumstance which
    we had already performed for the first the deductive science of society doe not
    lay down a theorem asserting in one universal manner the effect of any cause  but
    rather teach u how to frame the proper theorem for the circumstance of any given
    case it doe not give u the law of society in general but the mean of determining
    the phenomenon of any given society from the particular element or data of that
    society the consideration of the second form of the social problem is legislaless
    necessary to our purpose than that of the first and tion would lead farther into
    the method of general social science than is consistent with the limit of this
    article it will by this time be seen that the function of sociology is to supply
    the legislator with general rule and principle for solving particular practical
    problem and that there can be no science of law separate from the science of society
    when the legislator ha to act in any case he may consult the science a to the
    consequence of his acting in a given way or a to the way in which he should act
    to accomplish a proposed end  a to whether the end proposed is itself practicable
    and desirable or a to what end it would be most desirable to accomplish looking
    to the good of society legislation is the art of applying the middle principle
    of sociology and the general rule which it borrows from the science together with
    certain artprinciples of it own make up it whole theory ii it remains to consider
    the nature and limit of the modification of social phenomenon producible by legislative
    measure there are here two guiding principle that event subjected to invariable
    law are susceptible of modification in proportion to their complexity  and  that
    the change are producible by affecting their intensity and secondary operation
    but not their nature or filiation the posture into which an automaton may be thrown
    increase in number with the number of it joint while each joint definitely prescribes
    a peculiar motion to the portion of the figure in which it is situated and in
    a degree determines the fashion of all the posture when there are many joint an
    indefinite number of posture are readily producible while it is vain to attempt
    to throw the figure into any one for which a single joint would have to yield
    a motion contrary to it nature the case of a ship at sea moving between the point
    up to which it can be made to sail to the wind illustrates the same principle
    in this and every case of a combination of cause the producible modification are
    more numerous and easily effected the more numerous the cause are and the way
    in which they may be resolved so a to vary their joint effect  coming now to legislative
    action on the complex phenothe limit mena of society the former principle guarantee
    it facility of legislawhile the latter assigns it limit it may be stated in tlve
    actln general term that it is limited by the sociological law of harmony and succession
    and that within the limit prescribed by them it must operate by affecting their

    positive vol iv p   having ascertained the existence of general limit of variation
    peculiar to social phenomenon and especially of the modification dependent upon

    character and limit of such modification it belongs to the direct development
    of social science to determine in each case the influence and actual reach of
    this general principle by a special appreciation of the corresponding situation
    it is by such appreciation made empirically that those men of genius who have
    really exercised a great and profound influence on humanity in any way whatever
    have been guided  accepting the definition of evil that it is the result  of the
    nonadaptation of constitution to condition the consciousness of our power to modify
    phenomenon so a to accommodate constitution to condition within certain limit
    must be accepted a the ultimate source of our feeling of responsibility the legislator

    give a brief account of the different sens in which the term legislation and jurisprudence
    have been employed by different writer and indicate the division  of our subject
    which remain for discussion i he word jurisprudence and legislation have been
    employed in many sens legislation at one time denoted the science explaining the
    principle from which law ought to be universally derived and their application
    to particular country recently it ha been employed to represent that poition of
    the law of a state directly derived from the supreme authority in it legislative
    capacity and in this sense nnrdn ct s i jed z france from j uris prudence or that
    p rdon of the law derived from judicial decision in the nt r f se  nse  a s a  n  legislation

    knowledge of law a it is austin province of jurislegislaprudence on the other
    hand jurisprudence or in tion whewells element of morality ha both ot old andrecently
    been employed to signify the doctrine of right and obligation or the science of
    law and legislation to signify the art of applying the principle of the science

    the qualification of  natural or  universal ha had various province assigned to
    it adam smith moral sentiment vol ii speaking of the civil and criminal law of
    particular country observes that the principle upon which those rule either are
    or ought to be founded are the subjectof the science of natural jurisprudence
    the same function have been assigned by various writer to universal jurisprudence
    which again ha been limited by others to the investigation of the principle common
    to the law of all country sir james mackintosh us jurisprudence by itself in the
    sense assigned above to universal jurisprudence and again in a sense in which
    it is difficult to say whether he doe not mean it to stand for the who e body

    vol i p  carmignani again us the word legislation to signify  the science of establishing
    law and thus distinguishes it from jurisprudence or  the science of the application
    of law  and this is the sense in which mr james mill us the word jurisprudence
    when he say that it ha nothing to do with the constitution of right or the adapting
    them to the requirement of universal benevolence but that it object is to show
    the best mean of protecting right that exist whatever they are not to dwell on
    the misuse of the word science in most of the above cited application of these
    term it ha been shown that strictly there can be no science of law separate from
    the general science of sociology political ethology convert the theorem of social
    science into rule of policy and legislation is the art of applying these rule
    to particular case and the general rule and maxim of policy derived from the science
    together with it peculiar art principle make up the whole theory of legislation

    sentiment is a highly original work having published the substance of so important
    a part of his lecture smith wa enabled to make considerable retrenchment from
    the ethical part ot his course and to give a proportional extension to the disquisition
    on jurisprudence and political economy he had long been in the habit of embodying
    the result of his study and investigation with respect to both these department
    of political science but particularly the latter in his lecture and it appears
    from a statement which he drew up in  to vindicate his claim to certain political
    and literary opinion that he had been in the habit of teaching from the time he
    obtained a chair in the university of glasgow and even when at edinburgh the same
    enlarged and liberal doctrine with respect to the freedom of industry and the
    injurious influence of restraint and regulation which he afterwards so fully established
    in the wealth of nation his residence in a large commercial and manufacturing
    city like glasgow gave him a considerable advantage in the prosecution of his
    favourite study by affording mean of easily obtaining that correct practical information
    on many point which cannot be found in book and by enabling him to compare his
    theoretical doctrine with the experimental conclusion of his mercantile friend
    notwithstanding the alleged disinclination of men of business to listen to speculative
    opinion and the opposition of his leading principle to the old maxim of trade
    he wa able before leaving the university to rank some eminent merchant among his
    proselyte the publication of the theory of moral sentiment brought a vast accession
    of reputation to smith and placed him in the estimation of all who were qualified
    to form an opinion on such a subject in the first rank of moralist and of able
    and eloquent writer in  the senatus academicus of the university of glasgow unanimously
    conferred on him the honorary degree of doctor of law  in testimony a it is expressed
    in the minute of the meeting of their respect for his universally acknowledged
    talent and of the advantage that had resulted to the university from the ability
    with which he had for many year expounded the principle of jurisprudence but the
    most important effect of his increasing celebrity in so far at least a respected
    himself wa his receiving in  an invitation from mr charles townshend who had married
    the widow of the earl of dalkeith to attend her ladyship son the young duke of
    buccleuch on his travel  and the advantageous term that were offered combined
    with his strong desire to visit the continent induced him to accept the offer
    and to resign his chair at glasgow  with the connection which he wa led to form
    in consequence of this change in his situation say stewart  he had reason to be
    satisfied in an uncommon degree and he alwavs spoke of it with pleasure and gratitude
    to the public it wa not perhaps a change equally fortunate  a it interrupted that
    studious leisure for which nature seems to have destined him and in which alone
    he could have hoped to accomplish those literary project smith which had flattered
    the ambition of his youthful genius adam smith set out for france in company with
    his noble pupil in march  they remained only a few day at paris on their first
    visit to that capital but proceeded to toulouse where they continued for about
    eighteen month this being a considerable city and at that time the seat of a parliament
    the society in it may be presumed to have been a good deal superior to that of
    most country town and smith no doubt availed himself of it and of the leisure
    he then enjoyed to perfect and extend his knowledge of the literature internal
    policy and state of france he ha told u that he wa not disposed to place much
    confidence in the fact and reasoning of political arithmetician  and it is evident
    from his rarely making statement on the authority of others and from his occasionally
    referring to circumstance connected with toulouse geneva and other place which
    he visited that he wa chiefly indebted to his own observation and inquiry for
    his extensive information in regard to the institution habit and condition of
    the french people  after leaving toulouse smith and his noble pupil proceeded
    to geneva where they resided two month they returned to paris at christmas  and
    remained there for nearly a year during the whole of this period smith lived on
    an intimate footing with the best society in that city to which his friendship
    with hume greatly facilitated his introduction turgot afterwards comptrollergeneral

    count sarsfield buffon the baron dholbach madame riccoboni mademoiselle de lespinasse
    c were of the number of his acquaintance and some of them he continued ever after
    to reckon among his friend he wa also on familiar term with quesnay the author
    of the economical theory and there is every reason to think that he derived considerable
    advantage from his intercourse with that able and excellent person than whom none
    wa better qualified to strike out original and ingenious view so sensible indeed
    wa smith of his merit a a man and a philosopher that he intended had he not been
    prevented by quesnays death to have left a lasting testimony of the high place
    which he held in his estimation by dedicating to him the wealth of nation s in
    october  the duke of buccleuch accompanied by smith returned to london the latter
    soon after removed to his old residence at kirkcaldy w here he remained with little
    interruption for about ten year habitually occupied in study and in the elaboration
    of his great work this however wa not a tak but a labour of love labor ipse voluptas

    happy comfortable and contented i never wa perhaps more so in my life you will
    give me great comfort by  smith did not assume this distinction in private life
    but contented himself with printing it on the title of his work he had in truth
    little or no respect for academical honour which he ha characterised in very depreciatory
    term  it ha always appeared to u a a singular and not easily explained fact that
    notwithstanding their familiar acquaintance with the state of france we do not
    find either in hume or smith any anticipation how faint soever of the tremendous
    convulsion of which that country wa at no distant period the theatre and yet it
    had given numerous and those not obscure indication of it approach it is curious

    among my friend in london and so with a few v short interval he went on till in  an
    aera that will be for ever memorable in the history of political philosophy the
    inquiry into the nature and cause of the wealth of nation wa given to the world
    we have elsewhere examined most part of the leading theory and conclusion advanced
    in this famous work see introduction to article political economy at present it
    is enough to observe that despite it imperfection in a scientific point of view
    the objection that have been made and not without justice to it arrangement and
    the many change that have taken place since it publication in the policy and condition
    of nation it celebrity is in no degree diminished it is not in truth a book for
    one country or one age but for all country and all age and will always be regarded
    a a noble monument of profound thinking various learning and persevering research
    applied to purpose of the highest interest and importance little need be said
    in regard to the originality of the theory advanced by smith we have shown in
    the article referred to that some of the most important doctrine embodied in the
    wealth of nation had been distinctly announced and that trace more or le faint
    of the remainder may be found in various wmrks published previously to it appearance
    but this ha little or nothing to do with the peculiar merit of smith  and in no
    respect invalidates his claim to be considered a the real founder of the science
    of political economy some of it disjecta membra had indeed been discovered with
    indication of the others but their importance whether in a practical or scientific
    point of view and their dependence on each other were all but wholly unknown they
    formed an undigested mass without order or any sort of rational connection what
    wa sound and true being frequently a in the theory of the economist closely linked
    to what wa false and contradictory smith wa the enchanterwho educed order out
    of this chaos  e tenebris tantis tam clarutn extollere lumen qui primus potuisti
    inlustrans commoda vitae and in such complicated and difficult subject a higher
    degree of merit belongs to the party who first establishes the truth of a new
    doctrine and trace it consequence and limitation than to him who may previously
    have stumbled upon it by accident and dismissed it a if it were valueless he did
    not like the greater number of his predecessor build his conclusion on metaphysical
    abstraction or on the partial and distorted statement of interested or prejudiced
    party but on a careful review and analysis of the more prominent circumstance
    connected with the progress of society from antiquity down to his own time and
    none will be surprised that in taking for the first time so wide a survey he sometimes
    overlooked a principle or wa deceived in regard to it influence or operation and
    that in consequence some part of his book are defective or erroneous this however
    is but rarely the case he had none of that impetuous rashness which while it satisfies
    itself with hasty and superficial investigation push with unhesitating confidence
    every theory however narrow or illfounded to an extreme on the contrary he wa
    slow and circumspect and without seeking to establish new doctrine wa influenced
    by a sincere desire to trace and discover the natural and sound principle of public
    economy however  obscured by sophistry or encumbered by error and to exhibit what
    he believed would be found to be their practical working if allowed to come into
    free operation in pursuing his laborious inquiry his caution and his unequalled
    sagacity never forsook him and the real wonder is that a work involving so many
    abstruse research and conflicting consideration a that of smith should have so
    few blemish and be so nearly perfect a we find it to be it contains a greater
    number of useful and readily available truth than are to be found in any other
    publication and it pointed out and smoothed the path by following which subsequent
    inquirer have been able to perfect much which it author left incomplete to rectify
    the mistake into which he fell and to make many new and important discovery whether
    indeed we refer to the soundness of it leading doctrine the liberality and universal
    applicability of it practical conclusion or the powerful and beneficial influence
    it ha had on the progress of economical science and on the policy and conduct
    of nation the wealth of nation must be placed in the foremost rank of those work
    which have helped to liberalise enlighten and enrich mankind  by showing that
    the real and lasting interest of nation are always best promoted by cultivating
    a fair and friendly intercourse with their neighbour and that the jealousy and
    fear that were formerly entertained of the advance of others in wealth and civilisation
    are a unfounded a they are malevolent and base the wealth of nation ha contributed
    in no ordinarydegree to weaken national antipathy and to lessen the chance of
    war it influence in this respect ha been well illustrated by mr buckle who doe
    not hesitate to affirm that  adam smith contributed more by the publication of
    this single work towards the happiness of man than ha been effected by the united
    ability of all the statesman and legislator of whom history ha preserved an authentic
    account  hume who wa then labouring under his last illness addressed a congratulatory
    letter to smith on the publication of the wealth of nation and it is a curious
    fact that he pointed out in that letter what is the principal defect of the work
    viz the erroneous view which it give of the nature and cause of rent he say i
    cannot think that the rent of farm make any part of the price of produce it is
    not known whether hume had directly arrived at this conclusion or had derived
    it at second band from the writing or conversation of dr anderson  by whom it
    had been already established but it is singular seeing that his attention had
    been directed to tbe subject by one he so greatly esteemed that smith did not
    submit his statement in regard to rent to a more searching and caieful analysis
    had he done this he would most probably have adopted the view of anderson and
    hume and materially improved his work  smith survived the publication of the wealth
    of lsations fifteen year he had the satisfaction to see it translated into all
    the language of europe to hear his opinion quoted in the house of common to be
    consulted by the minister and to observe that the principle he had expounded smith

  text: k a kant published the full work in kbnigsberg idle government wlio were probably
    a much influenced by hatred and fear of the french revolution of which kant wa
    supposed to be a partizan a by love of orthodoxy resented the act and a secret
    cabinet order wa received by him intimating the displeasure of the king frederick
    william ii and exacting from him a pledge not to lecture or write at all on religious
    subject in future with this mandate kant after a struggle complied and kept his
    engagement till  when the death of the king according to his construction of his
    promise set him free this incident however produced a very unfavourable effect
    on his spirit he withdrew in  from society  next year he gave up all his class
    but one public lecture on logic or metaphysics  and in  before the removal of
    the interdict on his theological teaching he ceased altogether his public labour
    after an academic course of  year he had previously in the same year finished
    his two treatise on the laic of nature and on practical moral which with his anthropology
    completed in  were the last considerable work which he revised with his own hand
    his iectures on logic and on physical geography were edited during his lifetime
    by his friend and pupil by way of asserting his right to resume theological disquisition
    he also issued in  his strife of the faculty in which all the strongest part of
    his work on religion were urged afresh and the correspondence that had passed
    between himself and his censor wa given to the world from the date of his retirement
    from the chair kant declined in strength and gave token of intellectual decay
    his protest against fichte published in  is perhaps to be traced to this cause
    and he manifested other sign of uneasiness at the revolt of his former disciple
    from his authority his memory began to fail and a large work at which he wrought
    night and day on the connection between physic and metaphysics wa found to be
    only a repetition of his already published doctrine after  finding himself attacked
    with a weakness in the limb attended with frequent fit of falling he mitigated
    a little the spartan severity of his life and also consented to receive medical
    advice a constant restlessness oppressed him  his sight gave way  his conversation
    became an extraordinary mixture of metaphor  and it wa only at interval that gleam
    of his former power broke out especially when some old chord of association wa
    struck in natural science or physical geography a few day before his decease with
    a great effort he thanked his medical attendant for his visit in the word  i have
    not yet lost my feeling for humanity on the th of february  he breathed his last
    having almost completed the eightieth year of his age it is superfluous to characterize
    the genius of kant but a few word may be added a to his personal appearance and
    habit of life study and teaching his stature wa small and his appearance feeble
    he wa little more than five foot high his breast wa almost concave and like schleiermacher
    he wa deformed in the right shoulder his hair wa light his complexion fresh his
    forehead high and square while his eye of light blue showed an expression of unusual
    depth and power his sens were quick and delicate and though of weak constitution
    he escaped by strict regimen all serious illness till the close of life his life
    wa arranged with mechanical regularity and a he never married he kept the habit
    of his studious youth to old age his manservant awoke him summer and winter at
    five oclock and on being appealed to on one occasion testified that kant had not
    once failed in thirty year to respond to the call he studied after rising for
    two hour then lectured other two and spent the rest of the forenoon till one at
    his desk he then dined at a restaurant which he frequently changed to avoid the
    influx of n t  stranger who crowded to see and hear himtill in later kant year
    his growing mean enabled him to invite a friend or two daily to his own home this
    wa his only regular meal and a he loved the ducere ccenam of the roman he often
    prolonged the conversation till late in the afternoon he then walked out for at
    least an hour in all weather and spent the evening in lighter reading except an
    hour or two devoted to the preparation of his next day lecture after which he
    retired between nine and ten to rest the furniture of his house w r a of the simplest
    character and though he left a considerable sum the produce of his writing to
    his relative he indulged in no luxury and wa a pattern of that superiority to
    fashion and appearance so often met with in the literary life of germany in his
    earlier year he often spent his evening in general society where his overflowing
    knowledge and conversational talent made him the life of every party he wa especially
    intimate with thetamilies of two english merchant of the name of green and motherby
    where he found many opportunity of meeting shipcaptains and other travelled person
    and thus gratifying his passion for physical geography this social circle included
    also the celebrated hamannthe magus of the norththe friend of herder and jacobi
    who wa thus a mediator between kant and these philosophical adversary kant reading
    wa of the most extensive and miscellaneous kind he cared comparatively little
    for the history of speculation being in this department more a discoverer than
    a scholar but his acquaintance with book of science general history travel and
    belle lettres wa boundless he wa well versed in english literature chiefly of
    the age of queen anne and had read english philosophy from locke to hume and the
    scottish school he wa at home in voltaire and rousseau but show little acquaintance
    with the french sensational philosophy fie wa familiar with all german literature
    up to the date of his critique but ceased to follow it in it great development
    by goethe and schiller it wa his habit to obtain book in sheet from his publisher
    kanter and nicolovius  and he read over for many year all the new work in their
    catalogue in order to keep abreast of universal knowledge he wa excessively fond
    of newspaper and work on politics  and this wa the only kind of reading that could
    interrupt his study in philosophy a a lecturer kant avoided altogether that rigid
    style in which his book were written and which wa only meant for thinker by profession
    he sat behind a low desk with a few jotting on slip of paper or textbook marked
    on the margin before him and delivered an extemporaneous address opening up the
    subject by partial glimpse and with many digression and interspersed anecdote
    or familiar illustration till a complete idea of it wa presented his voice wa
    extremely weak but sometimes rose into eloquence and always commanded perfect
    silence like adam smith he fixed his eye on one student and marked by his countenance
    whether the lecture wa understood the least irregularity in the appearance or
    dress of this selected hearer disconcerted him and the story is well known of
    the missing button which defeated a lecture though kind to his student he refused
    on principle to remit their fee a this he thought would discourage independence
    it wa another principle that his chief exertion should be bestowed on the intermediate
    class of talent a the genius would help themselves and the dunce were beyond remedy
    hence he never delivered his deeper doctrine such a are found in his critique
    from the chair his other avocation allowed him little personal intercourse with
    his numerous hearer and he often complained of the want of lively sympathy and
    ascertained progress inseparable from such a system simple honourable truthful

    the study of latin for which he entertained at this time a strong aversion he
    also became known to professor robinson and stewart of edinburgh  and by their
    advice he wa in his thirteenth year sent to the university of st andrew to study
    mathematics under professor vilant on examination by the professor he wa found
    already qualified for the second or senior class and at the close of the session

    readily embraced and a a knowledge of latin wa now imperative he commenced doggedly
    to study it and by the aid of a private teacher qualified himself for entering

    language for no trace of it remained in his after life and he is extremely fond

    is the art of fabricating money so soon a nation emerge from a state of barbarism
    when simple barter no longer suffices to meet their want they will invent some
    common or conventional measure of value by which to exchange their product and
    carry on their commerce in the rude age of society cattle are said to have been
    the common medium of commerce and among the patriarch of old they were the measure
    of man wealth and greatness the armour of diomede say homer cost only nine ox  but
    that of glaucus cost a hundred ox in some country in former time salt wa the measure
    of value and instrument of exchange and in others shell formed the circulating

    extend they soon discover the inadequacy of these mean and will search for something
    of a more steady and durable character which shall serve both a a circulating
    medium a well a a medium of exchange with other country trading with them from
    a very early period metal a possessing that character in a high degree were chosen
    to perform these important function they are not only le perishable than other
    article but they can without loss be divided into any number of part and be united
    again by fusion  they can be hammered or rolled into plate and moulded into any
    shape and occupying le bulk than other article they are easily transported from
    place to place  different metal say adam smith  have been made use of by different
    nation for this purpose iron wa the common instrument of commerce among the ancient
    spartan copper among the ancient roman and gold and silver among all rich and
    commercial nation those metal seem originally to have been made use of for this
    purpose in rude bar without any stamp or coinage thus we are told by pliny upon
    the authority of timgeus an ancient historian that till the time of servius tullius
    the roman had no coined money but made use of unstamped bar of copper to purchase
    whatever they had occasion for these rude bar therefore performed at this time
    the function of money before the invention of coined money the precious metal
    were exchanged by weight only but a many obvious inconvenience attended that custom
    a an initiatory step piece of metal rudely shaped were stamped with their weight
    and then by degree the art of coining money wa introduced intended not only to
    indicate by the stamp of the sovereign authority the weight but also the fineness
    of the coin so long a copper and iron performed the function of money and measure
    of value probably the weight only wa the test of value but with regard to gold
    and silver another element enters into their appreciation of a much consequence
    a the weight itself the quality or fineness of these metal by which the value
    is determined can only be discovered by the laborious process of assay and therefore
    a adam smith remark before the institution of coined money unless this tedious
    and difficult operation were undertaken people must always have been liable to
    the grossest fraud and imposition and instead of a pound weight of pure silver
    might receive in exchange for their good an adulterated composition of the coarsest
    and cheapest material to guard the public against such fraud to facilitate exchange
    and thereby encourage industry and commerce mint were established in which piece
    of metal of determinate weight and fineness were stamped by public authority in
    order to declare the quantity and uniform goodness of the money so stamped that
    it should pas from hand to hand without doubt or suspicion in early time these
    coin or piece of metal constituted or denoted weight of different denomination
    or in other word they expressed the weight or quantity of metal contained in them
    a in the roman a or pondo which when money wa first coined at rome signified a
    pound weight of good copper consisting of twelve ounce a in our troy pound so
    the english pound sterling originally expressed not a coin exchangeable into  shilling
    but simply a pound weight of silver of sterling fineness the french livre likewise
    contained in the reign of charlemagne a pound weight of silver of a determinate
    quality and on the authority of adam smith the scot moneypound contained from
    the time of alexander i to that of robert bruce a pound of silver of the same
    weight and fineness with the english pound sterling english french and scot penny
    too contained all of them originally a real pennyweight of silver or gtstli of
    a pound the shilling also seems originally to have been the denomination of a
    weight and not of a coin of conventional value a the transition from mere barter
    by which one product of labour is exchanged for another to the use of metal a
    instrument of commerce indicates an advance in civilization  so the transition
    from the latter to the fabrication of coined money however rude and inartificial
    at first mark another progressive step in culture and refinement while the various
    design impressed on the coin and the mode of manufacture testify in nice degree
    the slow advancement of society in art taste and ingenuity an inquiry therefore
    into the coinage of a country like great britain from the earliest time posse
    an interest apart from the subject itself a a mere antiquarian research because

    controversy on the restoration of the currency at that time mr lowndes who differed
    from mr locke wished to execute the coinage at a rate per ounce conformable to
    the market price of silver so that the new currency we apprehend should form the
    standard of value overlooking the fact that the market price exceeding the mint
    price arose from the deficiency in the weight of those coin by which silver wa
    bought and sold  mr locke say a writer on the subject  with that acuteness for
    which he wa so justly esteemed contended that if s d of the coin weighed an ounce
    that would necessarily be the market price of silver and that it high price arose
    from s d of the then currency containing no more than an ounce of standard silver
    consequently if the coinage were executed at a higher rate than the standard of
    the th of elizabeth or s d an ounce it would be done at the expense of that justice
    and integrity between the government and the people which no government would
    sanction that regarded the right of personal property mr locke argument were so
    decidedly just and so convincing that the government carried the whole nation
    with them in the measure though it wa heavily felt owing to the exhausted state
    of the country after the long and expensive war it had been involved in despite
    locke argument and the policy founded upon them soon after the great coinage wa
    completed the market price exceeded the mint price of silver  the consequence
    of which wa the rapid disappearance of the new coin which found their way to the
    meltingpot and were sold in bar in the market hence before the year  the greater
    portion of the recoinage had disappeared from circulation to the detriment of
    the realm sir isaac newton in september  delivered in his report on the subject
    to the lord of the treasury in which he give it a his opinion that gold wa considerably
    overrated in the mint with respect to silver and in consequence of this report
    the guinea wa by proclamation declared current at s this reduction helped the
    relative proportion of gold to silver to approximate nearer to those of the market
    price  and a the avowed intention of newton report wa to give that rise in value
    to the silver coin which would protect it from being melted down it appears to
    have answered it purpose but only in degree for  though the recommendation in
    sir isaac newton report say the above authority  wa carried into effect by making

    to the guinea the proportion of standard gold to silver at the mint wa a  to  the
    proportion of the market a we find by the price of gold and silver wa about  to
    which constitutes a difference of about  per cent gold being still thus much rated
    above it value to silver and consequently not only wa no silver coined but the
    good and heavy coin were still melted for the higher price they brought in the
    state of bullion no other legislative measure having been taken than the one referred
    to and the market proportion of gold to silver having seldom afforded any encouragement
    to the public to coin silver we can have no difficulty in assigning a satisfactory
    reason for the degraded state of our silver currency during the last century and
    up to  in the year  and onwards there wa a general rerecoinage coinage of the
    gold currency which form another promiof gold nent feature in the history of the
    mint the professed ob ject of this undertaking wa the reformation of the currency
    by withdrawing the light and defective coin then in circulation  but the real
    motive wa to prevent if possible the new and heavy coin issued from the mint being
    melted down and sold a bullion for by reference to the price paid by the bank
    of england for gold it appears that s an ounce wa the market value while at the
    same time l of the gold coin then circulating would not weigh more than one ounce
    the holder of banknote demanded in payment new and heavy coin which were immediately
    turned into bullion and sold at the rate of s an ounce  and this being done on
    an extensive scale the bank wa compelled to have annually a large coinage of gold
    to meet the demand to remedy this inconvenience the recoinage wa undertaken and
    completed and it had the effect anticipated  for the price of gold since that
    period ha rarely ever exceeded but ha generally been under the mint price in truth
    a the price at which the bank purchase gold is fixed by act of parliament and
    a the bank is compelled to buy all gold tendered to it at the price of s d an
    ounce standard some naturally enough question the fact that we have any market
    price for gold bullion in england there cannot be a doubt however but for that
    law the price of gold would have fluctuated a other thing according to the supply
    and demand and it cannot but be deemed a great benefit to commercial interest
    to have by mean so simple a ready and constant market for their bullion at a price
    regular and certain political economist disagree a to the cause of the high price
    of gold previously to the recoinage referred to that eminent authority adam smith
    offer the following solution  by issuing too great a quantity of paper of which
    the excess wa continually returning in order to be exchanged for gold and silver
    the bank of england wa for many year together obliged to coin gold to the extent
    of between eight hundred thousand and a million ayear or at an average about eight
    hundred and fifty thousand pound for this great coinage the bank in consequence
    of the worn and degraded state into which the gold coin had fallen a few year
    ago wa obliged frequently to purchase bullion at the high price of l an ounce
    which it soon after issued in coin at l s gd an ounce losing in this manner between
    and  per cent upon the coinage of so very large a sum though the bank therefore
    paid no seignorage though the government wa properly at the expense of the coinage
    this liberality of government did not prevent altogether the expense of the bank
    upon this passage ricardo justly remark  on the principle above stated it appears
    most clear that by not reissuing the paper thus brought in the value of the whole
    currency of the degraded a well a the new gold coin would have been raised when
    all demand on the bank would have ceased or in

  text: combination combinaemancipated from the restraint of the law should endeavour
    to avail themselves of what wa supposed to be the powerful resource of combination
    it should also be borne in mind that a large number of individual began immediately
    to perceive that whatever might be their influence in other respect combination
    might be turned to good account by those by whom they were organized and managed
    but apart from the peculiar interest of such party it wa but reasonable to suppose
    that for a while at least combination would be in high favour with the workingclasses
    and that nothing but experience would suffice to convince them of their generally
    ruinous tendency although however we regret and condemn many of the proceeding
    of the workman we are very far from thinking that they form any valid reason either
    for the revival of the combination act or for the enactment of any similar statute
    nothing can apparently be more reasonable than that workman should be allowed
    freely to combine or associate together for the purpose of adjusting the term
    on which they will sell their labour wage like every thing else should always
    be left to be regulated by the fair and free competition of the party in the market
    without being interfered with by the legislature  the property say adam smith  which
    every man ha in his own labour a it is the original foundation of all other property
    so it is the most sacred and inviolable the patrimony of a poor man lie in the
    strength and dexterity of his hand  and to hinder him from employing this strength
    and dexterity in what manner he think proper without injury to his neighbour is
    a plain violation of the most sacred property but workman are not allowed freely
    to dispose of their labour if they be prevented from concerting with each other
    the term on which they will sell it capacity to labour is to the poor what stock
    is to the capitalist now a hundred or a thousand capitalist may form themselves
    into a company or combination take all their measure in common and dispose of
    their property a they may in their collective capacity judge most advantageous
    for their interestsand why should not a hundred or a thousand labourer be allowed
    to do the same by their stock  of all the variety of property which a man can
    posse the faculty of his mind and the power of his body are most particularly
    his own and to fetter him in the mode in which he is to exercise or dispose of
    these faculty and power is a manifest encroachment on the most inviolable of all
    right and can be justified only by an overwhelming necessity it is easy however
    to show that in point of fact no such necessity ever did or can exist the wage
    of any set of workman who enter into a combination for the purpose of raising
    them must be either below the natural and proper rate of wage in the branch of
    industry to which they belong or c they must be coincident with that rate or above
    it now it is clear that in the first case or when wage are depressed below their
    natural level the claim of the workman for an advance is fair and reasonable  and
    it would obviously be unjust and oppressive to prevent them from adopting any
    measure not injurious to the right of others which they may think best fitted
    to render their claim effectual but a voluntary combination among workman is certainly
    in no respect injurious to any right of their master it is a contradiction to
    pretend that master have any right or title to the service of free workman in
    the event of the latter not choosing to accept the price offered them for their
    labour and a the existence of a combination to procure a rise of wage show that
    they have not so chosen and is a proof of the want of all concord and agreement
    between the party so it is also a proof that the workman are fairly entitled to
    enter into it and that however injurious their proceeding may be to themselves
    they do not encroach on the privilege or right of others not only therefore is
    a voluntary combination unaccompanied by violence a fair exercise of the combinaright
    of judging for themselves on the part of workman tion but when it is entered into
    for the purpose of raising wage that are unduly depressed it object is proper
    and desirable few master willingly consent to raise wage and the claim of one
    or a few individual for an advance of wage is likely to be disregarded so long
    a their fellow continue to work at the old rate it is only when the whole or the
    greater part of the workman belonging to a particular master or department of
    industry combine together or when they act in that simultaneous manner which is
    equivalent to a combination and refuse to continue to work without receiving an
    increase of wage that it becomes the immediate interest of the master to comply
    with their demand and hence it is obvious that without the existence either of
    an open and avowed or of a tacit and real combination workman would not be able
    to obtain a rise of wage by their own exertion but would be left to depend on
    the competition of their master it is however abundantly certain that this competition
    will always raise wage that have been unduly depressed and it wa from not adverting
    to this fact that the influence of the combination law in depressing wage wa so
    very greatly exaggerated if the wage paid to the labourer in a particular employment
    be improperly reduced the capitalist who carry it on obviously gain the whole
    amount of this reduction over and above the common and ordinary rate of profit
    obtained by the capitalist who carry on other employment but a discrepancy of
    this kind cannot be of long continuance additional capital immediately begin to
    be attracted to the department where wage are low and profit high and it owner
    are obliged in order to obtain labourer to offer them higher wage it is clear
    therefore that if wage be unduly reduced in any branch of industry they will be
    raised to their proper level without any effort on the part of the workman by
    the competition of the capitalist and looking generally at the various employment
    carried on in the country we do not believe that the combination law had any sensible
    influence over the average and usual rate of wage that they occasionally kept
    them at a lower rate in some very confined business than they would otherwise
    have sunk to may be true though for that very reason they must have equally elevated
    them in others this however is no good reason why the workman engaged in employment
    in which wage happen from any cause to be unduly depressed should be prohibited
    from adopting the only mean in their power of doing themselves justice when they
    are allowed freely to combine their combination may occasion an immediate rise
    of wage but when their combination is prevented more or le time must always elapse
    before the high profit caused by the undue reduction of wage become generally
    known and consequently before capital can be attracted from other business and
    hence it is clear that every attempt to prevent combination in such case a this
    is neither more nor le than an attempt to hinder workman from making use of the
    only mean by which their wage can be speedily and effectually raised to their
    just level it is committing injustice in behalf of the strong at the expense of
    the weaker party we admit that the object of the second class of voluntary combination
    or of those which take place when the wage of the combining workman are already
    equal to or above their natural and proper rate is improper and unreasonable still
    however it is easy to see that there is no more cause for the interference of
    the legislature in this case than in the former there is no good reason why workman
    should not like the possessor of every other valuable and desirable article be
    allowed to set whatever price they please upon their labour if they combine to
    raise wage beyond their natural limit or to enforce vexatious or improper condi

    tion that their combination will be unsuccessful it may be  taken for granted
    that the master will resist any really improper demand and the slightest glance
    at the relative condition of the party must satisfy every one that supposing them
    to be in earnest in their opposition they can hardly fail to succeed in defeating
    it the workman always suffer more from a strike than the master it is indeed true
    a adam smith ha observed that in the long run they are a necessary to their master
    a their master are to them but this necessity is far from being so immediate the
    stock and credit of the master are in almost every instance much greater than
    the stock and credit of his labourer  and he is therefore able to maintain himself
    for a much longer time without their labour than they can maintain themselves
    without his wage in oldsettled and fullypeopled country wage are seldom so high
    a to enable labourer to accumulate any considerable stock and though the scanty
    fund of those engaged in strike are frequently eked out by contribution from the
    workpeople in other business and in other part of the kingdom the combination
    never fails provided the master do not give way to break to piece it is also evident
    that when workman enter into a combination to enforce an unreasonable demand or
    to raise wage that are already up to the common level they can gain nothing but
    must lose by entering into other employment to which they have not been bred while
    it is equally evident that a small extra sum will be sufficient to entice other
    labourer to the business they have left all the great department of industry have
    so many closely allied branch that a workman who is instructed in any of them
    can without much training or difficulty apply himself to some of the others and
    thus the workman who enter into the combination will not only fail of their object
    and be obliged to return to their work but owing to the influx of other labourer
    into their business during the strike they will probably be compelled to accept
    of a lower rate of wage than they previously enjoyed many extensive combination
    have been broken up by the master acting on this principle or by their bringing
    workpeople from other district or other business to supply the place of those
    in the combination at first these workpeople may not be so skilful or expert a
    those who have seceded but these deficiency soon become insensible and are more
    than compensated by the greater command the master have over the new hand who
    it is commonly stipulated shall not enter into any union or association with other
    workman for the purpose of raising wage regulating the hour of work c the combination
    of the coal miner of the north in  when about  hand struck for a modification
    of the condition under which they had previously been employed and an advance
    of wage though one of the most formidable that ha hitherto existed wa defeated
    in the way now mentioned it wa carefully organized and had when it began operation
    a reserve fund of about l besides receiving subscription from tradesunions in
    most part of the country but the coalowners determined not to give way and made
    every exertion to bring miner and other labourer from scotland wale and ireland
    to supply the place of those who had seceded the result justified the wisdom of
    their determination for the turnout after an obstinate strike of from four to
    five month duration in which they exhausted every resource and suffered the greatest
    privation were compelled to abandon every one of their pretension and to beg to
    be allowed to resume their employment under the same regulation a formerly at
    their old and in some case even at lower wage and this with but few exception
    is the ordinary result of the best organized combination the substitution of machinery
    for manual labour ha combinadone more perhaps than anything else to put down comtion
    binations in manufacturing employment and though injurious to the workpeople combination
    for an improper purpose are sometimes advantageous by the stimulus they give to
    the improvement of machinery in corroboration of this statement it is only necessary
    to refer to the machine for woolcombing mulespinning and others of the same kind
    which were invented and introduced to emancipate the master from the dictation
    of union and the unreasonable demand and proceeding of the woolcombers cottonspinners
    c they have been completely successful and have in truth not only rendered these
    employment comparatively independent of combination but have materially improved
    and cheapened the product of the manufacture into which they have been introduced
    even in the rare case in which workman from some peculiar circumstance such a
    their employer having entered into extensive contract to be completed within specified
    period have succeeded in obtaining an improper advance of wage it ha uniformly
    in the end been injurious to them this result is brought about in various waysby
    the high wage attracting too many labourer to the business by the various expense
    attendant on a combination which make a heavy deduction from the wage of those
    engaged in it by the demand for the article being checked or lessened by the greater
    cost of their production and so forth nothing indeed but the merest ignorance
    could make it be supposed that wage could be really increased by such proceeding
    they depend on a principle which they cannot affect that is on the proportion
    between capital and population and cannot be increased except by the increase
    of the former a compared with the latter for these reason we think it is impossible
    that any one who will calmly consider the subject should resist coming to the
    conclusion that a combination for an improper object or to raise wage above their
    proper level must cure itself or that it must necessarily bring it own chastisement
    along with it in some instance strike have been entered into from hostile feeling
    against obnoxious master and not unfrequently the workman are seduced into them
    by the artful representation of agitator in whom they place undeserved confidence
    and who make them the mean of advancing their own selfish end without caring for
    the misery they may entail on their dupe but in the majority of case a strike
    can hardly fail under ordinary circumstance to be a subject of the most serious
    concern to workman who have either forethought or experience and the privation
    to which it unavoidably expose them form a strong presumption that they are honestly
    impressed with a conviction that the advance of wage which they claim is fair
    and reasonable and that the strike ha been forced upon them by the improper resistance
    of the master even in those case in which wage are notoriously depressed below
    their proper level workman will if they consult their own interest be shy about
    striking and will resort to it only a a last resource such a proceeding instantly
    deprives them and those that are dependent on their exertion of their accustomed
    mean of subsistence in the event of their master delaying for any considerable
    period to come to an accommodation they are obliged from inability to support
    themselves to depend for a while on the grudging and stinted contribution of others
    and when this humiliating resource is exhausted they must return to the business
    they have left or else engage in employment to which they have not been bred and
    which are not congenial to their habit it is not therefore easy to suppose that
    workman when they become acquainted with the real effect of combination will rashly
    enter into them and proceed to a strike for the purpose of obtaining unreasonable

    of politics and political economy wa sufficient to excite suspicion of disaffectedness

    had the courage in his place a a university professor to canvas those question
    and to seek to inculcate on the intelligent youth of the land opinion of so advanced

    killed in general burgoyne army in  in the summer of  young mackintosh wa sent
    to school at the town of fortrose  and he had scarcely learned to read when he
    evinced that predilection for abstract speculation which afterwards formed so
    prominent a feature of his intellectual character a gentleman having lent him
    burnets commentary on the thirtynine article he perused it with great avidity
    and the part which struck him most forcibly and which he read with peculiar eagerness
    and pleasure wa the commentary on the seventeenth article which relates to predestination
    a strange subject to engage the attention and interest the understanding of a
    mere boy his mind appears to have revolted atthe doctrine of eternal decree of
    election and reprobation though surrounded by orthodox calvinist he became a warm
    advocate for free will and before he had completed m fourteenth year he wa probably
    the boldest heretic in the county about the same time he read the old translation
    of plutarch life echards roman history and the work of pope and swift his first
    poetical attempt wa a pastoral or elegy on the death of his uncle brigadiergeneral
    fraser who fell on the th of october  rn anc  n an  his muse wa exceedingly prolific
    and he even commenced an epic poem on the defence of cyprus by evagoras king of
    salami against the persian army in october  he entered king college aberdeen w
    ere he remained during that and the three following session at aberdeen he wa
    by common consent recognised  inter studiosos facile princeps whilst his courteous
    demeanour refined manner playful fancy and easy flow of elocution rendered him
    a general favourite amongst his companion his chief associate at king college

    had forced to seek in this northern vol xiii mac seminary for that academical
    education which wa denied to him a a dissenter in his own country like castor
    and pollux these young men were assimilated in the mind of all who knew them by
    reason of the equal splenour o their talent although in other respect they were
    extremely unlike in the spring of  having previously taken his degree of master
    of art he finally quitted king college  with he say but little regular and exact
    knowledge but with considerable activity of mind and boundless literary ambition  and
    in the october following he set out for edinburgh to commence the study of physic
    which he had made choice of a a profession his arrival in that city opened a new
    world to his mind edinburgh wa then the residence of many eminent men  of adam
    smith dr black john home henry mackenzie dr cullen principal robertson dr ferguson
    dr hutton professor robison mr dugald stewart and others he wa admitted a member
    of the speculative society which had been established about twenty year before

    speculation rather than study engrossed his attention speculator indeed are seldom
    submissive learner those who will make proficiency in useful knowledge must for
    a time trust to their teacher and believe in their superiority but those who too
    early think for themselves must sometimes imagine themselves wiser than their
    master and lienee docility is often extinguished when the work of education is
    scarcely commenced after three year spent in edinburgh he obtained the degree
    of md in  and eaily in   he set out for london his view were in the first instance
    directed to the medical profession  and he wa led from circumstance to contemplate
    a medical appointment in russia but this project in which he w r a supported by
    mr dugald stewart did not take effect and it is probable that he felt but little
    regret at the failure of a scheme which would have removed him from such a scene

    privately married to miss catharine stuart a young lady of a respectable scotch

  text: 'a ri s t o t l e practical involves a difficulty in reconciling the notion
    of justice with philosohis theory of virtue looking at justice a a dispensing
    phypower he observed that it wa concerned about  a mean in thing themselves in
    apportioning to each person his exact due whether of reward or punishment on the
    ground of this fact he point out that justice is not a mean a the other virtue
    are but is  of the meannot in itself  a relative mean but  relative to a mean
    had he considered justice solely a a moral habit he would have seen that the distinction
    wa unnecessary since in this point of view it conforms precisely to his general
    notion of virtue in being a principle of selfmoderation there is however a foundation
    for the remark in the circumstance that justice admits of greater exactness in
    it exercise than other virtue  the rule of justice say an excellent writer   may
    be compared to the rule of grammar the rule of the other virtue to the rule which
    critic lay down for the attainment of what is sublime and elegant in composition
    in the other virtue we are thrown more on our sense of propriety in forming our
    practical decision in justice we have evident fact before usthe merit or demerit
    of individual in themselves  and these form an external standard to guide u in
    our conduct over and above our internal conviction of right so far then justice
    may be regarded a of the mean besides being also a point of propriety or a mean
    within ourselves aristotle it should be observed had no other more appropriate
    word distinct from justice to express  honesty or  integrity and consequently
    wa led to generalize too far in his analysis of justice aristotle discussion of
    friendship  is open to similar objection he ha considered it in it outward effect
    a a social principle akin to justiceto which justice is subordinate and supplementaryrather
    than a an internal ethical principle the moderated exercise of benevolence in
    the heart itself his observation however on the subject admirably illustrate the
    importance of friendship to the right constitution of societythe various modification
    of the benevolent principle in the different relation of human life together with
    the peculiar amiableness of virtue in itself in the last respect indeed the discussion
    form an essential part of his moral philosophy a it tends to show his conviction
    that the moral principle have their seat in the heart indeed this part of his
    ethic a well a his inquiry into justice should be accurately studied by all who
    would obtain just view of the comprehensive character of the virtue of his system
    together they comprise a body of relative duty under justice would be classed
    the duty of religion memory of the dead filial reverence patriotism civil obedience
    veracity honesty c  so far a these duty flow from claim on our respect and are
    prescribed by human law under friendship the same duty a they are prompted by
    sentiment and feeling and are known by the name of piety gratitude benevolence
    fidelity generosity c hence the character of virtue in the little compilation
    on the virtue and vice which pass among his work  that  it is of virtue both to
    benefit the woithy and to love the good and to be neither apt to punish nor revengeful
    but merciful and placable and indulgent and thus there follow on virtue kindness
    equity candour good hope  moreover such quality a to be domestic friendly social
    hospitable philanthropic and a lover of what is honourable  his theory then of
    virtue must be regarded a involving a minute and distinct attention to all the
    particular virtue and herein appears it great excellence a contrasted with philosophy  those
    of some modern philosopher who have endeavoured practical to trace up all the
    virtue to some one principle of our nature philsoas benevolence or selflove or
    prudence all such theory v  are in truth mere accommodation of language by which   different
    class of phenomenon are arranged under the same term the effect of which is to
    give a shadowiness to the form of virtue instead of striking it out in distinct
    outline aristotle theory is the law by which these different principle are held
    together in factthe common process by which the operation of each virtue is carried
    on  and which when realized in the character of a man give him the command of
    all the virtue the ancient moral philosophy sought like the modern to resolve
    virtue into some one principle but the endeavour of the ancient wa chiefly to
    ground it on some intellectual principle socrates contended that the virtue were
    instance of prudence or knowledge fipovycreis or aoyoi or tmorrjjlai aristotle
    shews the foundation of this misconception in explaining in what respect the production
    of virtue might be regarded a the work of the intellect each virtue consisting
    a he shews in the adjustment of the action to all the circumstance of the case
    the virtue of an action must depend on the practical judgment of the individual
    agent and an agent who is uniformly virtuous must exhibit this practical judgment
    uniformly operating enabling him readily to decide on the point in which the virtue
    of acting lie  this operation of the intellect on moral object he designates a
    the intellectual virtue of prpctence or wisdom  when he speaks of it a  defining
    or bounding the mean in which virtue consists   he implies that asl speculative
    definition present to the mind an exact notion of the thing defined so the principle
    supplied by prudence give clear perception of the moral nature of an action for
    example suppose a man to have received some evidentwrongsome injury done to him
    without provocation the affection of resentment naturally lead him to requite
    the injustice on his assailant but by what method of action he should do so is
    a matter of question he must know exactly in what way his resentment should be
    shewn in order to act virtuously besides having a his general principle the inclination
    to act virtuously  he must therefore have had some experience of human lifesome
    practical knowledge of the nature of action which have been generally approved
    a fulfilling the end of this affection an experience then of this kind applied
    to the exercise of all the affection and operating invariably on the conduct constitutes
    the prudence of aristotle system it is thus intimately connected with the moral
    principle a the moral principle are with it it is the combined result in the intellectual
    part of our nature of all the virtue of the heart a on the other hand prudence
    is the diverging of the intellect through the various virtue of the heart hence
    his conclusion that it is impossible to be properly goodkvpiws ayaoovwithout prudence  or
    to be prudent without moral virtue  and consequently that all the moral virtue
    are inseparable inasmuch a the possession of all is requisite for the perfecting
    of prudence  and with prudence they all follow in this account of prudence is
    to be traced the principle of moral obligation involved in aristotle theory of
    virtue he considers the moral virtue a those of the inferior part of the soul
    and therefore a formed to obey  whereas the intellectual principle a being purely
    rational have a such an intrinsic authority prudence accordingly being the intellectual

  text: aristotle s philosophy practical check to population is required abortion
    should be produced philosobefore the quickening of the infant no law of morality
    he p h ythinks forbidding it at this period  these are striking instance of the
    infirmity of a philosophy which substitute an intrinsic agency in nature for the
    counsel of an intelligent divine agent working on nature according to such a philosophy
    everything adverse to the perfection of nature is a stumblingblock on the hypothesis
    of a providence the good and the evil may be contemplated with equal assurance
    that  the best will in the end prevail in the former case human reason remove
    suppresses destroys in the latter it moderate counteracts overrules doing nothing
    with rash violence but gently conspiring with the appointed course of thing in
    opening a way for good out of the evil in aristotle the immorality here noticed
    are moreover at dwect variance with the precept and spirit of his moral philosophy
    again the same moral complexion characterizes both the public and private discipline
    of the philosopher the honourable to kctw predominates over both by this standard
    every institution whether of bodily or mental exercise is to be regulated no illiberal
    art such a required manual rather than intellectual skill are to be taught not
    even are the liberal science to be pursued excessively or with exclusive devotion
    to any particular one or with mercenary view  the occupation of leisure being
    the end proposed by the system of education what wa useful or necessary wa to
    be learned but in subserviency to the honourable  and the honourable rather than
    the useful or necessary  hence the stress laid by aristotle on the art of painting
    and music it wa in the result a general cultivation of the mind by literature
    combined with moral discipline and not the storing it with particular science
    which his system of education contemplated he saw that the tendency of particular
    study wa to contract the mental power to that particular range of vision to which
    they were confined  whereas he sought rather to impart a largeness and masculine
    strength to the understanding commensurate with the varied demand of the world
    in which human life is cast it wa what we should express by the education of the
    accomplished gentleman of one who exempt from the drudgery of life and having
    his action freely at his own disposal might be qualified for the highest function
    to which nature ha destined man in forming him a moral and social being for it
    should be observed that aristotle throughout supposes an entire immunity from
    all servile employment both to the happy man and the happy citizen  according
    to his view a large proportion of mankind are physically incapable either of the
    happiness of moral being or of that of social life person so imperfectly constituted
    he conceives to be wholly dependent on others and to be by nature relative being
    or slave their proper nature being comprised in this relationship of dependence  to
    this class accordingly he would commit all the labour of agriculture of the mechanical
    art and the market and all menial office whilst others more gifted by nature enjoy
    leisure for the proper duty of man in the various relation of a moral and social
    being  the justification of the condition of slavery is thus rested by aristotle
    on abstract ground he viewed it a an institution of nature  differing in this
    from other philosopher and from the popular notion of his own countryman who either
    founded it on the right of conquest or on an assumed original difference between
    greek and barbarian this wa  a far more liberal view of the subject than that
    which prepractical vailed generally in his time for it implied that no one had
    philsoa right to retain another a his slave who wa not thus phyv p hy   sically
    dependent every one had a right to be free who wa capable of enjoying freedom
    in the performance of the duty for which man in his perfection wa constituted
    this doctrine further imposed on the master a strict moral attention to his slave
    the slave wa thrown on him not only for support but for direction in his duty  that
    religion should have formed no part of the business of education in his system
    wa further consistent with his ethic the moral koaov terminated in the perfect
    fulfilment of all those relation in which man wa placed a a being of this world
    it wa heightened by the consideration that god might delight in looking down on
    such perfection and that in it highest state it resembled the excellence of divinity
    but it did not strike it root into or draw it nourishment from religion nor did
    the kokov of social life the accomplished citizen might be taught to contemplate
    himself in the thoughtful activity of a philosophical leisure a holding a dignified
    station among men analogous to the divine principle which maintain the order of
    the universe  but there wa no connection between his social virtue and his religious
    system the religious colouring wa only the borrowed light of philosophy all active
    religion wa consigned to the instrumentality of a particular body of menthe priest
    the obligatory force of religion wa recognised but being lodged in an external
    establishment a it depository and sanctuary reverence wa sought for it by outward
    bond of respect by the privilege of the order to whose care it wa intrusted and
    the splendour of it public spectacle aristotle accordingly treat the subject merely
    a one of policy he observes that no one of the rank of a mechanic or peasant should
    be appointed a priest since it wa necessary that the god should be honoured by
    the citizen and he point out the importance of the religious character to the
    absolute sovereign of a state in order to the obedience of the subject  aristotle
    account of his theoretic polity leaf off abruptly at the end of the th book and
    the treatise is thus a now extant an imperfect development of his view but the
    theory of the perfect polity is only a part of the very valuable material of the
    politics the work embrace a wide survey of the social nature of man throughout
    indeed it may be studied a element of the philosophy of history it lay open the
    principle of preservation and decay inherent in the different constitution and
    point out the common principle on which the maintenance of civil order under any
    form whatever must essentially depend nor ha the study which now obtains the name
    of political economy been overlooked by aristotle the nature of money and of the
    wealth to which it ha given rise particularly attracted his attention it may suffice
    to shew how accurately he thought on the subject to observe that his account of
    the origin of moneytracing it to it service a a common measure of value in exchange
    and a a conventional substitute for a demand for commoditieshas been adopted by
    the author of the celebrated work the wealth of nation on the whole justly to

    way though human reason is limited and fallible and we are often swayed by prejudice

    they have been developed in a degree unknown to most other country france previously
    to the revolution wa divided into province having each peculiar privilege and
    separate code of revenue law and this also wa the case with germany spain and
    italy so that they were not only deprived of the freedom of foreign but even of
    internal commerce the inhabitant of each province being in great measure isolated
    from the rest there wa comparatively little competition  and instead of invention
    and active exertion there wa nothing but routine and indifference holland and
    the united state have been the only country that have enjoyed the same degree
    of internal freedom a great britain and the former notwithstanding the unfavourable
    physical circumstance under which she is placed ha long been and still is the
    richest country of europe while the latter whose condition is in other respect
    more favourable is advancing with giant step in the career of improvement but
    the freedom of the home trade or the stimulus given to invention by the competition
    of the different party within the same country how advantageous soever is always
    very inferior to the stimulus given by an unrestricted foreign trade a nation
    which admits either freely or under moderate duty the various production of others

    a restricted trade a business were introduced into a country which had no peculiar
    aptitude for carrying it on it would most likely be extinguished when trade wa
    made free but this extinction instead of being a loss to such country is a gain
    the capital and labour which were engaged in an unprofitable business will henceforth
    be diverted to those pursuit which the inhabitant can carry on with more advantage
    and their wealth and that of the community of nation will be increased by the

    but it is not perhaps so generally known that the division of labour is in a great
    degree dependent on the extent of the market and that it becomes more perfect
    and complete according a the latter is more and more extended there are many employment
    that cannot be carried on in thinly peopled country and of those that are or may
    be carried on in them or in others there is hardly one which may not be improved

    been determined by m bouillon la grange after a series of experiment to be  to  the
    phosphorescent brilliance of this sea is now known to be produced by noctilucous
    animalculum but it is not peculiar to the mediterranean the prevailing colour
    of the water is a deep blue  but in the adriatic it is of a greenish hue and towards
    the e it approach purple  iii the mediterranean receives many large river both
    trom europe and africa of which the most considerable are the ebro rhone po and
    nile and in addition to the river by which it is fed it derives a considerable
    supply of water from the strong current which always set in from the black sea
    and the sea of marmora through the dardanelles and also from the current which
    set in from the atlantic through the strait of gibraltar but a it level continues
    unchanged it would seem that the water entering it is not more than sufficient
    to supply the waste occasioned by evaporation some indeed have supposed that there
    is an undercurrent setting outward through the strait of gibraltar  but this opinion
    doe not seem to rest on solid and trustworthy evidence a calculation made by halley
    ot the quantity of water removed by evaporation showed it to be sufficiently great
    to preserve the level but according to smyth the ground for this theory are insufficient
    and incorrect but however it may be accounted for there can be no doubt of the
    fact that the system of compensation is accurately adjusted between the water
    coming in and going out the principal current of the mediterranean flow to the
    e from the atlantic along the african coast till it reach the coast of syria and
    asia minor when it return westward along the northern shore of the sea in the
    middle of the mediterranean between sicily and africa the current are very irregular
    varying according to the change of the wind and weather in the adriatic the current

    but keep due on to the propontis and the hellespont the mediterranean is subject
    to tide though these are very inconsiderable in comparison with other sea and
    very irregular in their motion  his fact however cannot be taken a any objection
    against the true theory of tide discovered by newton the weakness of those in
    this sea being a necessary consequence of it comparatively small extent and of
    the narrowness and position of it communication with the ocean which render it
    impossible for the level at any part to be considerably raised by the influx of
    water through a passage which is narrow and in a direction opposite to the course
    of the great tidal wave of the world the prevailing wind in the mediterranean
    are those which blow from n and w but in the spring month se and sw breeze are
    most frequent among the most remarkable wind in this sea is the mistral a cold
    wind which come from the snow of the alp and rush southward over provence and
    the valley of the rhone to the sea blowing with great violence and impetuosity
    and forming one of the scourge of provence of a very different character is the
    muchdreaded scirocco a hot wind blowing from the se over the sultry desert of
    africa this blast is felt on the s coast of sicily  but having passed over a large
    extent of water it is not so oppressive there a when it ha again become heated
    by traversing the island and it is especially felt at palermo on the n coast another
    wind very dangerous to ship is the bora  which like the ancient boreas whence
    it derives it name is a n or ne breeze it is frequently accompanied with thunder
    lightning and rain and sometimes last a long a three day though it usual duration
    is fifteen or twenty hour waterspout are of frequent occurrence in the mediterranean
    and are much dreaded or at least carefully avoided by cautious navigator they
    are believed to be the result of the rotatory motion produced in the atmosphere

    are common in this sea and one of the most remarkable and famous of these appearance
    consists of the ball of fire which play round the mast and rigging of ship called

    therefore are disposed entirely to approve of the principle of the bill introduced
    into parliament during the session of  by lord goderich for the compulsory registration
    of the partner in partnership the clamour that wa raised against it wa most unreasonable
    it could make no improper disclosure for if a man be ashamed of being in a partnership
    the sooner he leaf it the better it will be for himself and all concerned neither
    did it interfere in any manner of way with the freedom of industry or of association
    or lay any restriction on one thing or another it sole object wa to let in light
    on a few dark place  to show who messrs a b  co really were it eliminated fictitious
    name and disclosed real and sleeping partner  but it did nothing more it made
    no suggestion and gave no direction and we have yet to learn that any wrong could
    be done to any honest man by it disclosure while the benefit of which they would
    be productive are many and obvious we have no doubt that some measure having the
    same object in view will be eventually carried it is difficult to suppose that
    it should be objected to except by those who desire to be in the dark because
    it affords greater facility for the carrying out of sinister project when the
    joint debt of a firm are paid and the property duly distributed among the partner
    the dissolution may be said in a general sense to be accomplished if any one of
    the firm be guilty of a breach of duty in misapplying the effect before the concern
    is finally wound up the proper course is to apply to the court of chancery to
    appoint a manager within a reasonable time after the death of a partner the survivor
    or survivor must account to the representative of the deceased  and if not willing
    to do so a court of equity will compel him or them in taking partnership account
    at the death of a partner they must commence with the laststated account or if
    there be none such with the commencement of the partnership  and they must end
    with the state of the stock at the time of the partner death and the proceeds
    thereof until it be got in no notice is necessary to third party of the death
    of a partner the partnership is dissolved and all liability for subsequent act
    cease the surviving party are to be sued alone for the partnership liability and
    obligation for which they are liable to the full extent but they are not liable
    for the separate debt of the deceased partner unless after payment of the joint
    debt they have a surplus of partnership effect in their hand upon a dissolution
    by death if the joint effect be insufficient to pay the partnership debt the separate
    estate of the deceased partner if he have any is liable for the deficiency the
    statement now made may probably be sufficient to give our reader a tolerably distinct
    notion ol the formation of partnership and of the more important right duty liability

    ii companiesby a company in commerce and the art is meant a copartnery or association
    of sundry in great britain at least seven person united together for the prosecution
    or carrying on of some lawful business or pursuit the capital or joint stock of
    a company is greater or le according to circumstance but whatever may be it amount
    it is uniformly raised by the issue of such a number of share of such magnitude
    a those interested may think expedient the individual enrolled in the book of
    the company a the holder of these share being it partner owing however to the
    latter being in most instance very numerous living at considerable distance from
    each other partnerand being commonly engaged in other pursuit it is imshi ppracticable
    for them personally to conduct the company affair these are in consequence entrusted
    to the management of a board of director elected by and responsible to the shareholder
    the latter in fact can do nothing individually all their resolution are taken
    in common and are carried into effect by the director they have chosen and their
    officer in a private copartnery say adam smith  no partner without the consent
    of the company can transfer his share to another person or introduce a new member
    into the company each member however may upon proper warning withdraw from the
    copartnery and demand payment from them of his share of the common stock in a
    jointstock company on the contrary no member can demand payment of his share from
    the company but each member may without their consent transfer his share to another
    person and thereby introduce a new member the value of a share in a jointstock
    is always the price which it will bring in the market and this may be either greater
    or le in any proportion than the sum which it owner stand credited for in the
    stock of the company wealth of nation p  according to the common law of england

    of i tude of the share held by them are jointly and individupartners at ally liable
    to the whole extent of their fortune for the j mon debt of the company they may
    make arrangement among themselves limiting their liability with respect to each
    other but unless established by authority competent to set aside the general rule
    the partner are all indefinitely liable to the public in some instance however
    parliament interfered to limit the responsibility of the shareholder in jointstock
    company to the amount of their share and the act th geo iv c  empowered the crown
    to grant charter of association to company the partner of which might be made
    liable to such an extent and subjected to such regulation a might be deemed expedient
    and hence charter were sometimes granted for the purpose merely of enabling company
    to sue and be sued in the court of law in the name of their officebearers without
    in anywise limiting or affecting the liability of the shareholder to the public
    such limitation wa not to be implied by the grant of a charter and wa not held
    to exist unless it were distinctly set forth it is much to be regretted that the
    liability of the sharelimited holder ha been still farther interfered with and
    that in this respect a very serious inroad ha been made on the old law of the
    country the act of  the th and ral jy intr  th viet c  authorizes the establishment

    no longer liable for anything though the bankruptcy of the company to which they
    belong may occasion the ruin of thousand they cannot be called upon to contribute
    a single farthing to the relief of distress that have most probably been caused
    by their misconduct well might the highest authority who can be appealed to on

    ship mean of insight into the state of the concern no power over it management
    and no share in it advantage the commandite partner may have embarked a very small
    share of their property in the concern and must therefore be very slightly injured
    by it failure whilst those to whom it is indebted may be very seriously injured
    even to the extent of ruin  defective besides being vicious in principle the law

    to are sufficient and all partnership or company for ordinary industrial purpose
    if they consist of more than twenty partner must be established or registered
    under these act and made conformable to them while if they consist of seven and
    under twenty partner they may be so established or registered and in either case
    the liability of the partner may be limited to the amount of their share or be

    liability of the partner in such company wa not limited by the act referred to
    in addition to the clause in the act now mentioned a regulating the constitution
    of new and modifying that of old company there are others which relate to their
    voluntary and compulsory windingup their bankruptcy c and whether it were intended
    by parliament or not the effect of these statute ha been materially to modify
    the former indefinite liability of the partner in ordinary jointstock company
    these association have been by a sort of legislative hocuspocus metamorphosed
    into incorporation  so that their fund only are liable to be taken in execution
    by their creditor the right of the latter have in truth been sacrificed without
    compensation or equivalent of any sort  a creditor cannot now a he could have
    done three year ago pounce upon any shareholder he pleased and pursue him tor
    payment of his debt leaving to the shareholder to seek an indemnity from his copartner
    when the fund of a company supposing the liability of the partner to be unlimited
    are insufficient to make good it engagement a petition is presented to the court
    of chancery praying to have the company wound up on this being done the creditor
    can take no farther step in the matter but must wait the result the court may
    order call to be made sufficient to pay the debt due by the company but this is
    always a very slow process and if the creditor get paid in the end which may be
    doubtful it can only be after they have been kept out of their money for lengthened
    period most probably for a considerable number of year  we do not suppose that
    regulation having such consequence are likely to be permanent their nature and
    influence were not declared and were indeed very imperfectly known and that only
    to a few member when they were before parliament but the longer they are maintained
    the more mischievous will they be found to be it is not going partnertoo far to
    say that the present state of the law in regard ship to the constitution windingup
    and bankruptcy of jointstock company is more than discreditable that it is disgraceful
    to the country had it object been to introduce fraud and recklessness into their
    constitution and management and delay and expense into the legal proceeding to
    which they may give rise it is doubtful whether it could have been materially
    improved but supposing that jointstock company are properly undertakorganized
    that the liability of the partner is unlimited ln g s which and that creditor
    have every facility given them for getting ma y  su  payment of their debt still
    there are only certain variety carried of undertaking to which they can be advantageously
    apby jointplied to insure a reasonable prospect of success to a comstock company
    the undertaking should admit of it being carried on panic according to a regular
    systematic plan the reason of this is sufficiently obvious the business of a great
    association must be conducted by factor or agent  and unless it be of such a nature
    a to admit of their duty being clearly pointed out and defined the association
    would cease to have any effectual control over them and would be in great measure
    at their mercy and however conscientious and anxious to do their duty they want
    the powerful motif to act vigorously prudently and economically by which private
    individual engaged in business are actuated  like say adam smith  the steward
    of a rich man they are apt to consider attention to small matter a not for their
    master honour and very easily give themselves a dispensation from having it negligence
    and profusion therefore must always prevail more or le in the management of the
    affair of such company it also not unfrequently happens that they suffer from
    the bad faith a well a the carelessness and extravagance of their servant the
    latter having in many instance endeavoured to advance their own interest at the
    expense of their employer hence the different success of company whose business

  text: pit pittacus the task wa the most invidious that ever an orator under   i
    took but it wa performed with a humanity and delicacy which were warmly acknowledged
    by the mourning friend of him who wa gone the motion wa carried by  vote to  the
    d of february wa fixed for the funeral the corpse having lain in state during
    two day in the painted chamber wa borne with great pomp to the northern transept
    of the abbey a splendid train of prince noble bishop and privy councillor followed
    the grave of pitt had been made near to the spot where his great father lay near
    also to the spot where his great rival wa soon to lie the sadness of the assistant
    wa beyond that of ordinary mourner for he whom they were committing to the dust
    had died of sorrow and anxiety of which none of the survivor could be altogether
    without a share wilberforce who carried the banner before the hearse described
    the awful ceremony with deep feeling a the coffin descended into the earth he
    said the eagle face of chatham from above seemed to look down with consternation
    into the dark house which wa receiving all that remained of so much power and
    glory all party in the house of common readily concurred in voting forty thousand
    pound to satisfy the demand of pitt creditor some of his admirer seemed to consider
    the magnitude of his embarrassment a a circumstance highly honourable to him  but
    men of sense will probably be of a different opinion it is far better no doubt
    that a great minister should carry his contempt of money to excess than that he
    should contaminate his hand with unlawful gain but it is neither right nor becoming
    in a man to whom the public ha given an income more than sufficient for his comfort
    and dignity to bequeath to that public a great debt the effect of mere negligence
    and profusion a first lord of the treasury and chancellor of the exchequer pitt
    never had le than six thousand a year besides an excellent house in  he wa forced
    by his royal master friendly importunity to accept for life the office of warden
    of the cinque port with near four thousand a year more he had neither wife nor
    child  he had no needy relation he had no expensive taste he had no long election
    bill had he given but a quarter of an hour a week to the regulation of his household
    he would have kept his expenditure within bound or if he could not spare even
    a quarter of an hour a week for that purpose he had numerous friend excellent
    men of business who would have been proud to act a his steward one of those friend
    the chief of a great commercial house in the pit city made an attempt to put the
    establishment in downing pittenstreet to right  but in vain he found that the
    waste of weem the servant hall wa almost fabulous the quantity of v butcher meat
    charged in the bill wa nine hundredweight a week the consumption of poultry of
    fish of tea wa in proportion the character of pitt would have stood higher if
    with the disinterestedness of pericles and of de witt he had united their dignified
    frugality the memory of pitt ha been assailed time innumerable often justly often
    unjustly but it ha suffered much le from his assailant than from his eulogist
    for during many year his name wa the rallying cry of a class of men with whom
    at one of those terrible conjuncture which confound all ordinary distinction he
    wa accidentally and temporarily connected but to whom on almost all great question
    of principle he wa diametrically opposed the hater of parliamentary reform called
    themselves pittites not choosing to remember that pitt made three motion for parliamentary
    reform and that though he thought that such a reform could not safely be made
    while the passion excited by the french revolution were raging he never uttered
    a word indicating that he should not be prepared at a more convenient season to
    bring the question forward a fourth time the toast of protestant ascendency wa
    drunk on pitt birthday by a set of pittites who could not but be aware that pitt
    had resigned his office because he could not carry catholic emancipation the defender
    of the test act called themselves pittites though they could not be ignorant that
    pitt had laid before george the third unanswerable reason for abolishing the test
    act the enemy of free trade called themselves pittites though pitt wa far more
    deeoly imbued with the doctrine of adam smith than either fox or grey the very
    negrodrivers invoked the name of pitt whose eloquence wa never more conspicuously
    displayed than when he spoke of the wrong of the negro this mythical pitt who
    resembles the genuine pitt a little a the charlemagne of ariosto resembles the
    charlemagne of eginhard ha had his day history will vindicate the real man from
    calumny disguised under the semblance of adulation and will exhibit him a what
    he wa a minister of great talent honest intention and liberal opinion preeminently
    qualified intellectually and morally for the part of a parliamentary leader and
    capable of administering with prudence and moderation the government of a prosperous
    and tranquil country but unequal to surprising and terrible emergency and liable
    in such emergency to err grievously both on the side of weakness and on the side
    of violence t b m pittacus one of  the seven wise men of greece wa born at mitylene
    in lesbos bc  his father name wa hyrrhadius or caicus with the assistance of the
    son of alcaeus he delivered his country from the oppression of the tyrant melanchrus
    and in the war which the athenian waged against lesbos he appeared at the head
    of his countryman and challenged to single combat phrynon the enemy general a
    the event of the war seemed to depend upon this combat pittacus had recourse to
    artifice and when engaged entangled his adversary in a net which he had concealed
    under his shield and easily despatched him he wa amply rewarded for this victory
    and his countryman sensible of his merit unanimously appointed him governor of
    their city with unlimited authority in this capacity pittacus behaved with the
    greatest moderation and prudence  and after he had governed his fellowcitizens
    with the strictest justice and enforced the most salutary law he voluntarily resigned
    the sovereign power after having enjoyed it for ten year observing that the virtue
    and innocence of private life were incompatible with the power and influence of
    a sovereign his disinterestedness gained him many admirer and when the mitylenians
    wished to reward his public service by presenting him with an immense tract of
    territory he refused to accept more land than could be contained within the space
    to which a javelin could be thrown he died in the seventieth year of his age about  bc
    after he had spent the last ten year of his life in literary ease and peaceful
    retirement numerous anecdote of his clemency wisdom and contempt of wealth are
    related by diogenes laertius plutarch elian and other writer the former mention
    various communication between him and croesus and preserve a short letter said
