    to the kings minifters in scotland to arrange and fit the revenue accounts which

    of the kingdoms the attention of the scottilh parliament being alfo turned to
    the contrivance of fome means for fupplying the kingdom with money and facilitating
    the circulation of fpecie for want of which the induftry of scotland languilhed
    he propofed to them for thefe purpofes the eftablifhment of a bank of a particular

    value of all the lands in the country but this fcheme the parliament by no means
    thought it expedient to adopt his father dying about the year  law fucceeded to
    the fmall eftate of lauriefton but the rents being infufficient for his expences
    he had recourfe to gaming he was tall and graceful in his perfon and much addifted
    to gallantry and finery  and giving a fort of ton at edinburgh he went commonly
    by the name of beau laiu he was forced to fly his country however in the midft
    of his career in confequence of having fought a duel and killed his antagonift  and
    in fome of the french literary gazettes it is faid that he run off with a married
    lady in his flight from juftice us vifited italy  and was haniflted from venice
    and genoa becaufe he contrived to drain the youth of thefe cities of their money
    by his fuperiority in calculation that is by being a cheat and a harper he wandered
    over all italy living on the event of the moft angularbets and wagers which feemed
    to be advantagt us to thofe who were curious after novelty but which were always
    of the moft certain fuccefs with regard to him he arrived at turin and propofed
    his fyftem to the duke of savoy who faw atjonce that by deceiving his fubjefts
    he would in a fhort time have the whole money of the kingdom in his poiteflion  but
    that fagacious prince alking him how his fubjefts were to pay their taxes when
    all their money hould be gone law was dif concerted not expefting fuch a queftion

    tranfmitted his fchemes to defmareft and to chamillard who had rejected them as
    dangerous innovations he now propofed them to the due dorleans who dtfired noailles

    hares were inftituted of one thoufand livres each  and law depofited in it to
    the value of two or three thoufand crowns which he had accumulated in italy by
    gaming or otherwife this eftabliftiment very much difpleafed the bankers becaufe
    at the beginning bufinefs was tranfafted here at a very fmall premium which the
    old financiers had charged very highly many people had at firft little confidence
    in this bank but when it was found that the payments were made with quicknefs

    being all drefled and ready to be arranged in a circular form it might be thought
    neceffary in order to make the feams tight to trim the thin edges which are to
    be joined together in fuch a manner as that a ray palling from the outfide of
    the calk through a feam to the centre fhould touch the contiguous daves from the
    exterior to the interior fide  in other words that the thin edges fhould be loped
    as the archdones of a bridge are loped fo that the contiguous daves may be brought
    into firm contafl throughout the whole joint this however is not the practice
    of the cooper with great propriety he brings the contiguous laves into contact
    at their inner furfaces only  fo that by driving the hoops hard he can make the
    joints muchclofer than he could pofiiblyhave done had the edges of the daves been
    fo loped as to permit them to touch each other throughout before being drove together
    by the compreffion of the hoops this together with giving to the daves the proper
    curvature feems to be the only part of the coopers work which deferves the name
    of art for the driving of the hoops and the forming of the bottoms could certainly

    be attended with the fmalled difficulty we think indeed that in a large calk or
    tub it would prove injurious to the feam  for either thefe dovetails mud be very
    thin lips raifed from the interior edges of the daves which in many cafes could
    not be done if the wood were thoroughly feafoned  or if they be cut out like inverted

    of it fays that  he is perfuaded there was no other man of his time whole fancy
    as a writer was bright enough whofe ikill as an interpreter was deep enough and
    whofe heart as a moralift wasre enough to have made him the author of that little
    work by moft readers this drain of panegyric will be thought extravagant and of
    courfe it will defeat its own purpofe  but the work is certainly a work of merit  in
    the year  when the author was vicechancellor was publiihed in two volumes to dr
    hornes commentary on the pfalms it is a work of which very different opinions
    have been formed though it was the refult of the labour of twenty years that it
    will always be a favourite companion of the devout chridian we are as much inclined
    to believe as mr jones but we cannot without belying our own judgment fay that
    it appears to us calculated to produce much general good in an age like the prefent
    granting it to be true which we believe will not be granted without fome exceptions
    that clarke and hoadley and hare and middleton and warburton and sherlock and
    south and williamlaw and edmund law had turned the public attention of which they
    had got the entire command too much to the letter of the bible to the negledf
    of the fpirit of it fhould not dr horne after the example of bt paul have let

    rather than pour it upon them at once in a flood of fplendor the apoflle  fed
    his corinthian converts with milk and not with meat when he found them unable
    to bear the fatter food and there is reafon to fufpeft that the carnal followers
    of warburton and sherlock and south were unable to bear at once fuch ftrong meat
    as that which makes the fifteenth pfalm a portrait of our saviour indeed we think
    it not improbable that the mind of sherlock would have recoiled with horror from
    the very conception of the pojtbihty of jtfus chrift fwcaring to his neighbour
    and diiappointing him though that conception muff have paffed through a mind which
    was certainly as pure as his the commentary however though truth thus compels
    us to fay that in our opinion it is far from perfect is certainly a work of great
    learning great genius and fervent piety and fuch as the devout chriftian will
    perufe again and again with much advantage dr hornes next work was of a different
    kind and we think of a fuperior order in the year  was pubiifhed a letter of dr
    adam smiths giving an account of the death of mr david hume the objea of the author
    was to hew that mr hume notwithrtanding his fceptical principles had died with
    the utmoft compofure and that in his life as well as at his death he had conduced
    himfelf as became one of the wifefl and belt men that ever exiiled the letter
    is very much laboured and yet does no honour either to the author or his friend
    it could notreprefent mr hume as fupporting himfclf under the gradual decay of
    nature with the hopes of a happy immortality  but it might have reprefented him
    as taking refuge with otherdnfidels in the eternal ikep of death this though but
    a gloomy profpeft would hornti c   h o r this traa was not have been clfildlfh
    i but the hero of the tale is ex hbited as talking like a fchool boy of his conferences

    his father had left him in debt with nothing but the profits which he might make
    of a imallfarm to difeharge that debt and to iupport himfelf and three fillers
    in him therefore rigid economy was for many years a irtue  and he knows little
    of human nature who can blame a man for not breaking habits which it had been

    from home not only for the proper quantity of blankets to his bed but alio for

    we cannot poiitively lay that thefe fufpicions are groundlefs  but the writer
    of this article has converfed much about the author of the epigoniad with a clergyman

    gentlemen in the urivverfity of oxford jfperfed in a late anonymous pamphlet and
    whatever may be thought of the queb tion at iffue all men muft admire the temper
    with which the apologift conduaed himfelf under very great prove cu but it was
    not about hutchinfonianifm alone that thefe two illuftrious men were doomed to
    differ mr horne took a decided part again ft mr kcnnicotts propofal for collating

    of rt for min the text and preparing it for a new tranflation into the englifh

    the hebrew text with three queries formed user eon and humbly fulmitted to the
    chnjhan world that his alarm was on this occafion too great experience has hewn  but
    that it was not groundless is evident from the view in which the reader will find
    above  inftances from mr kenmcotts dffertations fee kennicott encycl to fhew what
    an inundation of licentious criticifm was breaking m upon the facred text indeed
    there is reafon to believe that this traft together with another on the fame fide
    of the queftion by dr rutherford of cambridge contributed to reprefs the collectors
    rafhnefs and to make the bible of dr kennicott the valuable work which we find
    it be this as it may fuch was the moderation of the drs kennicott and horne that
    though their acquaintance commenced in hoftihty they at lengtn contrafted for
    each other a friendfhip which lafted to the end of their lives and ftill fubfifts
    between their famihes   in what year mr horne was admitted to the degree of d
    d and when he was chofen prefrdent of his col lege mr jones has not informed us  but
    if our memory does not deceive us he had obtained both thefe preferments when
    in the year  he gave to the public a fmall work vo entitled confiderations on

    was no other man of his time whofe fancy as a writer was bright enough whofe ikill
    as an interpreter was deep enough and whole heart as a moralift was pure enough
    to have made him the author of that little work by moft readers this ftrain of
    panegyric will be thought extravagant and of courfe it will defeat its own purpofe  but
    the work is certainly a work of merit in the year b when the author was vicechancellor
    was publiftied in two volumes to dr hornes commentary on the pfalms it is a work
    of which very different opinions have been formed though it w t as the refult
    of the labour of twenty years that it will always be a favourite companion of
    the devout chrittian we are as much inclined to believe as mr jones  but we cannot
    without belying our own judgment fay that it appears to us calculated to produce
    much general good in an age like the prefent granting it to be true which we believe
    will not be granted without fome exceptions that clarke and hoadley and hare and
    middleton and warburton and sherlock and south and william law and edmund law
    had turned the public attention of which they had got the entire command too much
    to the letter of the bible to the negleft of the fpirit of it  fhould not dr horne
    after the example of st paul have let in the light gradually upon fuch weak organs
    as thofe of the public thus difeafed rather than pour it upon them at once in
    a flood of fpletidor the apoftle  fed his corinthian converts with milk and not
    with meat   when he found them unable to bear the latter food  and there is reafon
    to fufpeft that the carnal followers of warburton and sherlock and south were
    unable to bear at once fuch ftrong meat as that which makes the fifteenth pfalm
    a portrait of our saviour indeed we think it not improbable that the mind of sherlock
    would have recoiled with horror from the very conception of the pojfibilily of
    jefus chrift  fwearing to his neighbour and disappointing him though that conception
    muft have paffed through a mind which was certainly as pure as his the commentary
    however though truth thus compels us to fay that in our opinion it k far from

    he was able however to give his fon a liberal education and that fon it is faid
    difcovered fo early a propenfity to the ftudy of poetry that he began to write
    verfes in his tenth year as this wonderful prematurity of genius was never heard
    of during wilkies life it will probably be confidered as a ftory fabricated to
    raife the scottifh poet to the fame eminence with pope whofe verfification he
    is allowed to have imitated with fuccek we have no doubt but that wilkie wrote
    in early life the defcription of a ftorm which is publilhed in the th volume of
    the statiftical account of scotland but that he wrote it in his tenth year is
    not proved and is highly improbable the poem difplays a notiona confufed notion
    indeedof the laws of elericity which a boy in his tenth year and at a period when
    elericity was little underftood could not have acquired having learned the rudiments
    of the latin tongue at thejarifhfchool of dalmeny young wilkie was at the age
    of thirteen lent to the univerfity of edinburgh where he was foon diftinguifhed
    by his originality of thought and by his rapid progrefs in erudition and fcience
    among his fellowttudent he was moft clofe jy affociated with dr robartfon the
    hfftorian mjohn home the poet dr mghiea who afterwards obtained the friendfhip
    of johnfon and became a member of the ivylane club  and a mr cleghorn who promifed
    in which he was afwilkie terwards a profeffor but died before he had time to rea
    rmm lize the fond hopes of his friends during the courfe of his education wilkie
    became acquainted with the celebrated david hume and dr fergufon and at a later
    period with dr adam smith the farfamed author of  the wealth of nation of all
    thofe men he regarded dr fergufon with the greateft affeion and dr smith with
    the greateft admiration this laft writer he confidered as equal to robertfon and
    hume in erudition and vaftly their fuperior in originality and invention  and
    this opinion he cherifhed to the day of his death before he bad completed his
    education his father died leaving him no other inheritance than the ftock and
    unexpired leafe of his farm and the care of his three fifters wilkie therefore
    turned much of his attention to agriculture in which he became eminent not merely
    as a theorift but as a practical farmer he had too much fcience to be the flave
    of ancient prejudice and too much judgment to be hurried into hazardous experiments
    by the charms of untried fpeculation one of his fifters being married to a fkilful
    though unlettered farmer he availed himfelf of his brothers experience and upon
    the fats and maxims derived from him built a fyftem of praftical farming which
    fully anfwered his own expeftation and obtained the applaufe of all his neighbourshe
    ftill profecuted his ftudies in the univerfity and without ceafing to be a farmer
    became a preacher in the church of scotland for fome years this made no alteration

    he drew from the fourth book of the iliad where sthenelus gives agamemnon a hort
    account of the facking of thebes  and as that city was taken by the fons of thofe
    who had fallen before it wilkie gave to his poem the quaint title of epigoniad
    from the greek word tviyovoi which fignifies defeendants it is not our bufinefs
    to write a criticifm upon this poem i he fubjedi was illchofen for the learned
    reader has enough of the heroic ages in the immortal poems ot homer and virgil
    and in thofe ages the unlearned reader can feel no intereft the epigoniad therefore
    though compofed in fmooth and elegant vtrfe with due attention to ancient manners
    and conftrued on the moft regulaf plan has fallen into negled from which no critic
    or biographer will ever refeue it in the year  mr wilkie was ordained minifter

    of liquors the latin word doium which we tranoate  a calk was employed by the
    romans to denote earthen veflels ufed for this purpofe though the word dolare
    from which it is derived applies very well to our calks which are compofed of
    feveral pieces of wood hewn from the fame tree and fitted by planes before they
    be joined together we are indeed cerfin that calks of the fame kind with our own
    were in ufe among the romans before the chriftian era  for both varro and columella
    in treating of the rural economy of their days fpeak of veflels formed of feveral
    haves of wood bound together by circles or hoops the merit of having invented
    fuch veflels is given by pliny to certain people who lived at the foot of the
    alps and who in his days lined their calks with pitch at what period the fabrication
    of calks was introduced into britain is unknown to us though it is probable that
    we derived the art from the french who might have it from the romans we need hardly
    inform any of our readers that a calk has the appearance of two truncated cones
    joined at their bafes or that the part where the junction appears to be made being
    the moll capacious or that of which the diameter is the largeft is vulgarly called
    the belly of the calif thefe cones however were they completed would not be regular
    but rather conoids being formed of pieces of timber or ftaves which are not ftraight
    lines as in the cone but are curved from the vertex to the bafe in choofing his
    wood if he can have a choice the cooper prefers old and thick and ftraight trees
    from which he hews thm planks to be formed into ftaves  and in france where this
    art is pradlifed on a large fcale the winter months are allotted for the preparation
    of the ftaves and bottoms and the fummer for putting them together or mounting
    the calk the author of the article in the hncyclopedie metbodique directs the
    cooper when drefling the ftaves with the plane to cut the wood always acrofs  a
    pradtice which we doubt not is proper though we think it would not be eafy to
    aflign the reafon of it plaining is the moll laborious and difficult part of the
    work  and there are but few coopers who plane quickly and at the fame time well
    in ihops where the work is diftributed into parts plaining is reckoned a great
    objeft  and in france before the revolution a good plainer gained from three hillings
    and threepence fterling to four ihiilings and three farthings aday in forming
    the ftaves it mull never be forgotten that each is to conllitute part of a double
    conoid  that it mull therefore be broadeft at the middle becoming gradually though
    not in ftraight lines narrower towards the extremities that the outfide acrofs
    the wood mull be wrought into the fegment of a circle  and that the have mull
    be thickeft near the middle growing thinner by very gentle degrees towards the
    ends to adjuft accurately thefe different curves for even the narrowing of the
    ftaves mull be in a curve to the lize and intended lhape of the calk would require
    either great experience or a larger portion of mathematical fcience than we have
    reafon to think that many coopers pofwifi f a  fl    c   cop ment of a circle
    or not and therefore the cooper very cooper feldom takes that trouble copernicus
    the ftaves being all drefled and ready to be arranged in a circular form it might
    be thought neceffary in order to make the teams tight to trim the thin edges which
    are to be joined together in fuch a manner as that a ray palling from the outfide
    of the calk through a feam to the centre ihould touch the contiguous ftaves from
    the exterior to the intenor fide  in other words that the thin edges ihould be
    hoped as the archftones of a bridge are hoped fo that the contiguous ftaves may
    be brought into firm contafl throughout the whole joint this however is not the
    pradtice of the cooper with great propriety he brings the contiguous ftaves into
    contadl at their inner furfaces only  fo that by driving the hoops hard he can
    make the joints much clofer than he could poffibly have done had the edges of
    the ftaves been fo hoped as to permit them to touch each other throughout before
    being drove together by the compreffion of the hoops this together with giving
    to the ftaves the proper curvature feems to be the only part of the coopers work
    which deferves the name ot art  for the driving of the hoops and the forming of
    the bottoms could certainly be accomplilhed by any carpenter we had almoll faid
    by any man though he had never feen a hoop driven or a bottom formed in many parts
    of scotland inftead of ale or beer mugs they ufe fmall hooped wooden veffels of
    which the ftaves are featheredged or dovetailed into one another this as the ftaves
    are of different colours increafes the beauty of the veffel and to a fuperficial
    obferver appears to be an ingenious contrivance  but if adds nothing to the ftrength
    or tightnefs of the feam and cannot be attended with the fmalleft difficulty we
    think indeed that in a large calk or tub it would prove injurious to the ftam  for
    either thefe dovetails mull be very thin flips raifed from the interior edges
    of the ftaves which in many cafes could not bedone if the wood were thoroughly
    feafoned or if they be cut out like inverted wedges the contiguous haves mull
    be brought into contadl from the interior to the exterior fide previous to the
    driving of the hoops  and in that cafe as we have feen the feams could not be

    not for a long time acquire a very general currency with the public it was adopted
    by the learned only and not always by them a in this refpeft the publication of

    fubiefts of political economy and by beating down wit its keen powers of ridicule

    various myfterious doddrines at this time prevailed in the german fchools concerning
    the peculiar nature of re as their notions of the caufticity of alkaline fubftances
    involved fome of thefe doflrines a great many objecaons were ftarted to a theory
    which threatened to overtnrow long ellablilhed and favourite opinions the moft
    formidable opponent to the new theory was proftilor meyer of ofnaburgh all the
    phenomena of the caudicity and mildnefs of lime and alkalies were according to
    his explanation to be accounted for by tne aftion o a fubftance of a peculiar
    nature to which he gave the name of acidum pingue this fubftance which was fuppcfed
    to be formed in the line during calcination conlilled of an igneous matter in
    a certain ftate of combination with other fubftances it is a matter of fome furprife
    that dr black fhould have experienced any uneafinefs on account of the oppofition
    made to his difcovery by mere hypothefis unfupported by faffs or even by plaufible
    argument when his own doffrine had been fully and irrefragably eftablifhed by
    the fure teft of decifive experiment nor is it lefs furprifing that he fhould
    have taken great pains for feveral years in the courfe of his leflures in refuting
    the arguments and in combating the objeftions of meyer to his own theory drblacks
    reception at the univerfity of glafgow was highly flattering and encouraging as
    a ffudent he had not only done himfelf much credit by his fuccefsful progrefs
    in the different purfuits in which he was engaged but he had alfo during his refidence
    there conciliated the attachment and affbaion of the profeitors in a high degree
    when he returned as a profeftbr he was immediately conneaed in the ftria eft friendihip
    with dr adam smith then profeflbr of moral philofophy in that univerfity and this
    friendihip which now commenced grew ftronger and ftronger and was never interrupted
    through the whole of their lives a fimplicity and fenfibility an incorruptible
    integrity the ftriaeft delicacy and correanefs of manners marked the charaaer
    of each of the philofophers and firmly bound them in the clofeft union at giafgow
    dr black foon acquired great reputation as a profeftor and became a favourite
    phyfician in that large and aaivecity his engaging countenance his agreeable and
    attraffive manners free from all ftudied endeavour to pleafe and the kind concern
    he took in the cafes intrufted to his care made him a moft welcome vifitor in
    every family it was between the years  and  that he biought to maturity his fpeculations
    concerning heat which had occupied his attention at intervals from the ve d jvft
    dawn of his philofophical inveftigations his difcoveries in this department of
    fcience were by far the moft important of all that he made and perh ips indeed
    the mort valuable which appeared during tne bufy period of the th century to enter
    fully into the nature of his inveftigations would be improper in this place  but
    the fum of them all was ufually exprefted by him in the following propofitions
    when a folid body is converted into a fluid there enters into it and unites with
    it a quantity of heat the prefence of which is not indicated by the  g  b l a
    thermometer and this combination is the caufe of the fluidity which the body ailumes
    on the other hand when a fluid body is converted into a folid a quantity of heat
    feparates from it the prefence of which was not formerly indicated by the thermometer
    and this fepaiation is the caufe of the folid form which the fluid aflumes w hen
    a liquid body is raifed to the boiling temperature by the continued and copious
    application of heat its particles fuddenly attract to themfelves a great quantity
    of heat and by this combination their mutual relation is fo changed that they
    no longer attracft each other but are converted intoan elaftic fluid like air
    on the other hand when thefe elaftic fluids either by condenfation or by the application
    of cold bodies are reconverted into liquids they give out a vaft quantit o heat
    tiie prefence oi which was not formerly indicated by the thermometer i bus water
    when converted into ice gives out  qo of heat and ice when converted into water
    abforbs  of heat and w r ater when converted into fleam abforbs about iooo of
    heat without becoming fenfibly hotter than     philofophers had been long accuftomed
    to confider the thermometer as the fureft method of deteding heat in bodies yet
    this inftrument gives no indication of the  of heat which enter into air when
    it is converted into water nor of the iooo which combine with water when it is
    converted into fleam dr black therefore faid that the heat is concealed latet
    in the water and fleam and he briefly expreffed this faft by calling the heat
    in that cafe latent heat dr black having eftablifhed this difcovery by ample and
    decifive experiments drew up an account of the whole inveftigation and read it
    to a literary fociety which met every friday in the facultyroom of the college
    confifting of the members of the univerfity and feveral gentlemen of the city
    who had a relifii for philofophy and literature this was done april   as appears
    by the regifters this doarine was immediately applied by its author to the explanation
    of a vaft number of natural phenomena and in his experimental inveftigations he
    was greatly aflifted by his two celebrated pupils mr watt and dr irvine as dr
    black never publifhed an account of his doctrine of latent heat though he detailed
    it every year fubfequent to  in his leisures which were frequented by men of fcience
    from all parts of europe  it became known only through that channel and this gave
    an opportunity to others to pilfer it from him piecemeal dr crawfords ideas reipedling
    the capacity of bodies for heat were originally derived from drblack who firft
    pointed out the method of inveftigating that fubject the inveftigations of lavoifier
    and laplace concerning heat publiftied many years after were obvioufly borrowed
    from dr black and indeed confifted in the repetition of the very experiments which
    he had fuggeiled yet theie philofophers never mention dr black at all every thing
    in their diflertation affinnes the air of originality  and indeed they appear
    to have been at great pains to prevent the opinions and difcoveries of dr black
    from being known among their countrymen but perhaps the moft extraordinary procedure

    an exception to this general rule it contains a large quantity of ftarch which
    does not feern inferior to the ftarch prepared from wheat fo far at leaft as that
    ingredient is to be regarded as contributing to the nouriihing qualities of the
    grain its tafte relembles more nearly than any other root the tafte of bread  and
    accordingly it is daily beginning to be more extenfively ufed and to form a larger
    portion of the food of the poor the celebrated dr adam smith long fince remarked

    by its effeft upon the common people of ireland who have for a confiderable length

    of human food than a crop of any kind of grain upon the fame extent of ground
    a scots acre of good land which will not produce more than  pounds weight of oatmeal
    will eafily produce  pounds weight of potatoes and will fometimes in favourable
    feafons produce  or  pounds weight of that valuable root suppofing one pound of
    oatmeal to contain as much nourifhment as four pounds of potatoes ftill it is
    evident that where an extent of territory employed in the produftion of oats can

    of potatoes will funvegetables port fifteen millions of perfons   ior potatoes

    much more bulky than grain in too bidky proportion to the quantity of nourifliment

    been converted into malt yet as the roots are formed in the bofom of the foil

  text: b l a  black the theory of the nature of quicklime and the caufe of its caufticity
    was foon known to the german chemifts and from them it met with ftrong oppofition
    aorimic m  it v i rm i h rvm  k j l   i       various myderious doctrines at this
    time prevailed in the german fchools concerning the peculiar nature of fire as
    their notions of the caufticity of alkaline fubftances involved fome of thefe
    dodtrines a great many objedtions were ftarted to a theory which threatened to
    overthrow long eftablilhed and favourite opinions the molt formidable opponent
    to the new theory was profeffor meyer of ofnaburgh all the phenomena of the caufticity
    and mildnefs of lime and alkalies were according to his explanation to be accounted
    for by the adtion of a fubltance of a peculiar nature to which he gave the name
    of acidum pingue this fubltance which was fuppofed to be formed in the lime during
    calcination confiited of an igneous matter in a certain ftate of combination with
    other fubltances it is a matter of fome furprife that dr black ihould have experienced
    any unealinefs on account of the oppofition made to his difcovery by mere hypothefis
    unfupported by fadts or even by plaufible argument when his own dodtrine had been
    fully and irrefragably ellablilhed by the fure telt of deeifive experiment nor
    is it lefs furprifing that he ihould have taken great pains for feveral years
    in thecourfe of his ledtures in refuting the arguments and in combating the objedtions
    of meyer to his own theory dr blacks reception at the univerfity of firlafgow
    was highly flattering and encouraging as a ftudent he had not only done himfelf
    much credit by his fuccefsful progrefs in the different purfuits in which he was
    engaged but he had alfo during his refidence there conciliated the attachment
    and affedtion of the profeffors in a high degree when he returned as a profeffor
    he was immediately connedted in the flridtell friendfhip with dr adam smith then
    profeffor of moral philofophy in that univerfity and this friendihip which now
    commenced grew llronger and llronger and was never interrupted through the whole
    of their lives a limplicity and fenfibility an incorruptible integrity the ftridlell
    delicacy and corredtnefs of manners marked the charadter of each of the philofophers
    and firmly bound them in the clofeft union at glafgow dr black foon acquired great
    reputation as a profeffor and became a favourite phyfician in that large and adlive
    city his engaging countenance his agreeable and attradiive manners free from all
    liudied endeavour to pleafe and the kind concern he took in the cafes intrufted
    to his care made him a moll welcome vilitor in every family it was between the
    years  and  that he brought to maturity his fpeculations concerning heat which
    had occupied his attention at intervals from the very firll dawn of his philofophical
    inveffigations his difcoveries in this department of fcience were by far the moll
    important of all that he made and perhaps indeed the molt valuable which appeared
    during the bufy period of the th century io enter fully into the nature of his
    inveftigations would be improper in this place but the fum of them all was ufually
    expreffed by him in the following propofitions when a folid body is converted
    into a fluid there enters into it and unites with it a quantity of beat the prefence
    of which is not indicated by the   b l a thermometer and this combination is the
    caufe of the fluidity which the body affumes on the other hand when a fluid body
    is converted into a folid a quantity of heat feparates from it the prefence of
    which was not formerly indicated by the thermometer and this feparation is the
    caufe of the folid form which the fluid affumes when a liquid body is raifed to
    the boiling temperature by the continued and copious application of heat its particles
    fuddenly attradl to themfelves a great quantity of heat and by this combination
    their mutual relation is fo changed that they no longer attradt each other but
    are converted into an elaftic fluid like air on the other hand when thefe elaftic
    fluids either by condenfation or by the application of cold bodies are reconverted
    into liquids they give out a vail quantity of heat the prefence of which was not
    formerly indicated by the thermometer thus water when converted into ice gives
    out  of heat and ice when converted into water abforbs  of heat and water when
    converted into fleam abforbs about i of heat without becoming fenfibly hotter
    than  philofophers had been long accuftomed to confider the thermometer as the
    fureft method of detedling heat in bodies yet this inttrument gives no indication
    of the  of heat which enter into air when it is converted into water nor of the  which
    combine with water when it is converted into fleam dr black therefore faid that
    the heat is concealed latet in the water and fleam and he briefly expreffed this
    fad by calling the heat in that cafe latent heat dr black having eflabliflied
    this difcovery by ample and decifive experiments drew up an account of the whole
    invefligation and read it to a literary fociety which met every friday in the
    facultyroom of the college confifting of the members of the univerfity and feveral
    gentlemen of the city who had a relilh for philofophy and literature this was
    done april   as appears by the regiflers this dodrine was immediately applied
    by its author to the explanation of a vaft number of natural phenomena and in
    his experimental invefligations he was greatly affiled by his two celebrated pupils
    mr watt and dr irvine as dr black never publilhed an account of his doctrine of
    latent heat though he detailed it every year fubfequent to  in his ledures which
    were frequented by men of fcience from all parts of europe  it became known only
    through that channel and this gave an opportunity to others to pilfer it from
    him piecemeal dr crawfords ideas refpeding the capacity of bodies for heat were
    originally derived from dr black who firft pointed out the method of inveftigating
    that fubjed the invelligations of lavoifier and laplace concerning heat publiffed
    many years after were obvioufly borrowed from dr black and indeed eon filled in
    the repetition of the very experiments which he had fuggefted yet thefe philofophers
    never mention dr black at all  every thing in their differtation affumes the air
    of originality  and indeed they appear to have been at great pains to prevent
    the opinions and difcoveries of dr black from being known among their countrymen

    they are all capable of affording nourifhment to the human conftitution and of
    preferving it in health and vigour  when grinded into meal they require little

    with a fmall quantity of water or any other liquid of the roots which are ufed

    confifting chiefly of carrots turnips and parfnips are never ufed as a foie nutriment
    being rather adopted for the purpofe of giving variety and relifti to other food
    and chiefly to butchers meat the potato however is in fome roeafure an exception
    to this general rule it contains a large quantity of fiarch which does not feem
    inferior to the ftarch prepared from wheat fo far at leaft as that ingredient
    is to be regarded as contributing to the nouriftiing qualities of the grain its

    it is daily beginning to be more extenfively ufed and to form a larger portion

    feafons produce  or  pounds weight of that valuable root suppofing one pound of
    oatmeal to contain as much nouriftiment as four pounds of potatoes ftill it is

    in the cultivation of potatoes will fupport fifteen millions of perfons  man potatoes

    they are both formed of fimilar fub n  fiances the potato being analogous to wheat
    and the carrot and parfnip to rye or rather to barley after it has been converted
    into malt yet as the roots are formed in the bofom of the foil and are of a loofe

    the bringing to perfefion the fmall grains which are produced in the air at the

  text: b l a    b l a the theory of the nature of quicklime and the cause of its
    causticity was soon known to the german chemists and from them it met with strong
    opposition various mysterious doctrines at this time prevailed in the german schools
    concerning the peculiar nature of lire as their notions of the causticity of alkaline
    substances involved some of these doctrines a great many objections were started
    to a theory which threatened to overthrow long established and favourite opinions
    the most formidable opponent to the new theory was professor meyer of osnaburgh
    all the phenomena of the causticity and mildness of lime and alkalies were according
    to his explanation to be accounted for by the action of a substance of a peculiar
    nature to which he gave the name of acidum pingue this substance which was supposed
    to be formed in the lime during calcination consisted of an igneous matter in
    a certain state of combination with other substances it is a matter of some surprise
    that dr black should have experienced any uneasiness on account of the opposition
    made to his discovery by mere hypothesis unsupported by facts or even by plausible
    argument when his own doctrine had been fully and irrefragably established by
    the sure test of decisive experiment nor is it less surprising that he should
    have taken great pains for several years in the course of his lectures in refuting
    the arguments and in combating the objections of meyer to his own theory dr blacks
    reception at the university of glasgow vas highly flattering and encouraging as
    a student he had not only done himself much credit by his successful progress
    in the different pursuits in which lie was engaged but he had also during his
    residence there conciliated the attachment and affection of the professors in
    a high degree when he returned as a professor he was immediately connected in
    the strictest friendship with dr adam smith then professor of moral philosophy
    in that university and this friendship which now commenced grew stronger and stronger
    and was never interrupted through the whole of their lives a simplicity and sensibility
    an incorruptible integrity the strictest delicacy and correctness of manners marked
    the character of each of the philosophers and firmly bound them in the closest
    union at glasgow dr black soon acquired great reputation as a professor and became
    a favourite physician in that large and active city his engaging countenance his
    agreeable and attractive manners free from all studied endeavours to please and
    the kind concern he took in the cases intrusted to his care made him a most welcome
    visitor in every family it was between the years  and  that he brought to maturity
    his speculations concerning heat which had occupied his attention at intervals
    from the very first dawn of his philosophical investigations his discoveries in
    this department of science were by far the most important of all that he made
    and perhaps indeed the most valuable which appeared during the busy period of
    the th century to enter fully into the nature of his investigations would be improper
    in this place  but the sum of them all was usually expressed by him in the following
    propositions when a solid body is converted into a fluid there enters into it
    and unites with it a quantity of heat the presence of which is not indicated by
    the thermometer and this combination is the cause of the fluidity which the body
    assumes on the other hand when a fluid body is converted into a solid a quantity
    of heat separates from it the presence of which was not formerly indicated by
    the thermometer and this separation is the cause of the solid form which the fluid
    assumes when a liquid body is raised to the boiling temperature by the continued
    and copious application of beat its particles suddenly attract to themselves a
    great quantity of heat and by this combination their mutual relation is so changed
    that they no longer attract each other but are converted into an elastic fluid
    like air on the other hand when these elastic fluids either by condensation or
    by the application of cold bodies are reconverted into liquids they give out a
    vast quantity of heat the presence of which was not formerly indicated by the
    thermometer thus water when converted into ice gives out  of heat and ice when
    converted into water absorbs  of heat and water when converted into steam absorbs
    about iooo of heat without becoming sensibly hotter than  philosophers had been
    long accustomed to consider the thermometer as the surest method of detecting
    heat in bodies yet this instrument gives no indication of the  of heat which enter
    into air when it is converted into water nor of the loco  which combine with water
    when it is converted into steam dr black therefore said that the heat is concealed
    latet in the water and steam and he briefly expressed this fact by calling the
    heat in that case latent heat dr black having established this discovery by simple
    and decisive experiments drew up an account of the whole investigation and read
    it to a literary society which met every friday in the facultyroom of the college
    consisting of the members of the university and several gentlemen of the city
    who had a relish for philosophy and literature this was done april   as appears
    by the registers this doctrine was immediately applied by its author to the explanation
    of a vast number of natural phenomena and in his experimental investigations he
    was greatly assisted by his two celebrated pupils mr watt and dr irvine as dr
    black never published an account of his doctrine of latent heat though he detailed
    it every year subsequent to  in his lectures which were frequented by men of science
    from all parts of europe j it became known only through that channel and this
    gave an opportunity to others to pilfer it from him piecemeal dr crawfords ideas
    respecting the capacity of bodies for heat were originally derived from dr black
    who first pointed out the method of investigating that subject the investigations
    of lavoisier and laplace concerning heat published many years after were obviously
    borrowed from dr black and indeed consisted in the repetition of the very experiments
    which he had suggested yet these philosophers never mention dr black at all  every
    thing in their dissertation assumes the air of originality  and indeed they appear
    to have been at great pains to prevent the opinions and discoveries of dr black
    from being known among their countrymen but perhaps the most extraordinary procedure
    was that of mr deluc j this philosopher had expressed

    weight of barley or even of oats will render a quantity of water as thick or full
    of mucilage as can be done by the same weight of wheat after wheat oats have in
    our country been considered as of very great importance it is a hardy and beautiful
    plant grows with little cultivation and is particularly well suited for lands
    newly brought in from a state of nature upon which it was always used as the first
    crop till the introduction of the turnip husbandry the meal of it is usually very
    coarsely grinded and mixed with a considerable quantity of the inner covering
    of the grain hence it has always a considerable degree of roughness and is harsh
    and unsuited to very delicate constitutions  but this very harshness from its
    stimulant effect producing a feeling of warmth in the stomach renders it more
    grateful to persons much exposed to the open air and accustomed to hard labour
    who account it a hearty kind of food essentially and in its intrinsic qualities
    this grain differs little from some others barley is chiefly valued in consequence
    of the facility with which it produces a great quantity of saccharine matter by
    the process of vegetation or malting which fits it for the preparation of vinous
    or spirituous liquors pease are also sometimes used when grinded into meal as
    an article of human food j but on account ol their viscid and indigestible quality
    they can never become valuable in that point of view unless to persons engaged
    in the open air in the most active and severe kinds of labour in other respects
    however it does not appear that there is much difference in point of quality or
    wholesomeness between the various kinds of grain cultivated in different countries
    they are all capable of affording nourishment to the human constitution and of
    preserving it in health and vigour  when grinded into meal they require little
    farther preparation and are easily made into bread or otherwise prepared for immediate
    consumption by being mixed according to the fancy or taste of different nations
    with a small quantity of water or any other liquid of the roots which are used
    to afford subsistence to man the potato has hitherto been the principal the rest
    consisting chiefly of carrots turnips and parsnips are never used as a sole nutriment
    being rather adopted for the purpose of giving variety and relish to other food
    and chiefly to butchers meat the potato however is in some measure an exception
    to this general rule it contains a large quantity of starch which does not seem
    inferior to the starch prepared from wheat so far at least as that ingredient
    is to be regarded as contributing to the nourishing qualities of the grain its
    taste resembles more nearly than any other root the taste of bread  and accordingly
    it is daily beginning to be more extensively used and to form a larger portion
    of the food of the poor the celebrated dr adam smith long since remarked its tendency
    to produce a strong and handsome race of people as demonstrated by its effect
    upon the common people of ireland who have for a considerable length of time in
    a great measure subsisted upon it u l t u r e theor it is to be observed concerning

    have hitheir de l therto possessed these radical defects the carriage of fee ta
    them is extremely expensive in consequence of their too weight arising from the
    vast quantity of moisture they  contain hence they can only be cultivated in abunportatioa

    upon the farm as the food of p  cattle j boots are also incapable of long preservation
    in are unit the winter they are destroyed by frost and in summer for long by heat
    which causes them to vegetate or to corrupt jp rese  both of which changes render
    them unfit to be used as food   these roots are also much more bulky than grain
    in too bulk proportion to the quantity of nourishment contained in for the it
    them hence they are rendered less fit to be consumed niac k by persons engaged
    in sedentary professions such persons accordingly seldom fail to find them injurious
    to the stomach by their bulkiness and their tendency to injure the powers of digestion
    by producing flatulencies and other unpleasant consequences s on the whole the
    difference between these succulent wherei roots and the grain of corn plants seems
    to amount totheydif this that although they are both formed of similar subfer
    f rom stances the potato being analogous to wheat and the s  carrot and parsnip
    to rye or rather to barley after it has been converted into malt yet as the roots
    are formed in the bosom of the soil and are of a loose and watery texture their
    formation tequires from nature a slighter effort than the bringing to perfection
    the small grains which are produced in the air at the top of corn plants she therefore
    compensates by an abundant crop the diminished quality of her work hence it has
    appeared an important problem in ecohowthe nomics to devise a plan by which the
    succulent roots may be of vegetables may be deprived of their superfluous readereii
    moisture that thus human art may perform for them t  a what nature has not accomplished

    of this system were led to the adoption of one directly opposite according to
    them agriculture formed the only real source of wealth this opinion was first
    advanced by m quesnay a physician of paris  he was followed by a multitude of
    philosophers who espoused his opinion with all the union and zeal of a sect accordingly
    they went under the name of economists and the economical sect the encyclopedic
    of diderot and dalembert was conducted entirely upon their principles and tended
    to give them a wide circulation turgot in the reforms which he undertook during
    his short administration was chiefly guided by the principles of the economists
    soon after this scotland had the honour of producing a system which has obtained
    the general approbation of thinking men and has gradually superseded all others
    adam smith being professor in the first commercial city of scotland had his attention
    naturally drawn to these subjects in his class he had already begun to illustrate
    the true principles of political economy travelling afterwards in france he became
    acquainted with the leading members of the economical school on his return he
    spent nine years in maturing his ideas and preparing his great work  on the wealth
    of nations which was published in  here like the economists he shewed the errors
    of the mercantile system but in a much more solid and satisfactory manner he shewed
    also their own principles to be in many respects erroneous  and he investigated
    the effects of the division of labour and various other circumstances which had
    not occurred to any former writer although the system of smith gave general satisfaction
    to all who were able to investigate the subject and though it was even adopted
    by mr pitt as the basis of his financial and commercial arrangements yet it did
    not for a long time acquire a very general currency with the public it was adopted
    by the learned only and not always by them a in this respect the publication of
    the edinburgh review may be considered as forming an era in the history of this
    science this celebrated journal by illustrating in a popular manner the leading
    subjects of political economy and by beating down with its keen powers of ridicule
    the opinions of those who still adhered to the obsolete system has done more towards
    diffusing the true principles of the science than any former publication lord
    lauderdale also has recently published a work in which with some paradoxes he
    has economy  made also some important additions and corrections to nature of the
    doctrine of smith wealth in the following sketch considering smith as the fa c  ther
    of political economy we shall closely follow his steps adopting however a somewhat
    different arrangement and including such improvements as the science has received
    since his time the subject it appears to us may be treated with advantage under
    the following heads  i the nature and different species of wealth ii the sources
    of wealth iii the manner in which wealth is produced and distributed iv views
    of the mercantile and economical systems v public revenue these topics will form
    the subjects of the following chapters chap i on the nature and different species

    was presented to the church of langholm in scotland where he married  and our
    author was one of the younger sons he was born about the year  and was educated
    by his father in his early years his passion for poetry frequently discovered
    itself though till the age of  he did not show any particular attachment to books
    at that time having accidentally met with spensers faery queen he became enamoured
    of his manner of writing and instantly began to imitate him after the death of
    his father he came to edinburgh to reside with his uncle who was a brewer there
    and who admitted him into a share of his business  not being qualified to succeed
    in this line he went to london about the time of the conclusion of the w  ar which
    began in  with a view to procure a commission in the marine service here he was
    disappointed but introduced himself to the first lord lyttelton to whom he sent
    one of his poems from his lordship however he received no other favour than being
    admitted to several interviews and encouraged to persevere in his poetical plans
    so closely did our author cultivate the study of the muses that before he was  years
    of age he had written two tragedies and half an epic poem  but all these were
    committed to the flames the first of his poems which appeared in print was published
    in one of the edinburgh magazines and entitled  on passing through the parliament
    close of edinburgh at midnight this was afterwards inserted in a collection of
    original poems by a scotch gentleman vol ii p  from the time of mr mickles arrival
    in london till the year  it is not known how he employed his time though it is
    probable that he was employed in some branch of the printing business  and in  he
    engaged himself as corrector to the clarendon press this year he published the
    poem which first brought him into notice entitled  pollio an elegiac ode written
    in the mood near k iloslin castle to this was an elegy written on the death of
    his brother which previous to its publication had been shown to lord lyttelton
    and received some corrections from him the latter in an epistle to the author
    spoke of it as equal to any thing of the kind in our language in j published a
    poem called  the concubine in two cantos after the manner of spencer to  and in  he
    published a letter to mr harwood wherein some of his evasive glosses false translations
    and blundering criticisms in support of the arian heresy contained in his literal
    translation of the new testament are pointed out and confuted vo and next year
    he published  mary queen of scots an elegy  hengist and mary a ballad and  knowledge
    an ode in pearchs collection of poems in ijjo he published il voltaire in the
    shades or dialogues on the deistical controversy vo the elegy on mary had been
    submitted to the judgment of lord lyttelton who declined to criticise it not for
    its deficiency in poetical merit but from thinking differently from the author
    concerning that unfortunate princess about this time mr mickle was a frequent
    writer m the whitehall evening post but a more important work now engaged his
    attention when no more than mickk  years of age he had read castaras translation
    of the lusiad of camoens into french and then projected the design of giving an
    english translation of it from this however he was prevented by various avocations
    till the year  when he published the first book as a specimen and having prepared
    himself by acquiring some knowledge of the portuguese language he determined to
    apply himself entirely to this work with this view he quitted his residence at
    oxford and went to a farm house at foresthill wheie he pursued his  design with
    unremitting assiduity till the year  when the work was entirely finished during
    the time that mr micklewas engaged in this work he subsisted entirely by his employment
    as corrector of the press  and on ins quitting that employment he had only the
    subscriptions he received for his translation to support him notwithstanding these
    difficulties he adhered steadily to the plan he laid down and completed it in
    about five years when his work was finished mr mickle applied to a person of great
    rank w r ith whom his family had been connected for permission to dedicate it
    to him permission was granted and his patron honoured him with a very politer
    letter  hut after receiving a copy for which an extraordinary price was paid for
    the binding  he did not think proper to take any notice of the author at last
    a gentleman of high rank in the political world a firm friend to the author and
    who afterwards took him under his protection waited on the patron and heard him
    declare that he had not read the workj but that it had been represented not to
    have the merit it w r as at first said to possess the applause with which the
    work was received however soon banished from the authors mind those disagreeable
    sensations which had been occasioned by the contemptuous neglect of his patron
    as well as some severe criticisms which  had been circulated concerning it a second
    edition w r as prepared in  with a plate prefixed to it executed by the celebrated
    artist mortimer on whom mr mickle wrote an epitaph in   this year also he published
    a pamphlet entitled  a candid examination of the reasons for depriving the  east
    india company of its charter contained in the history and management of the east
    india company from its commencement to thepresent time together  with some strictures
    on the selfcontradictions and historical errors of dr adam smith in his reasons
    for the abolition of the said company to about this time some of his friends thought
    of recommending him to the king as deserving of a pension  but this scheme was
    never put in execution dr lowtb bishop of london would have put him into orders
    ami provided for him in the church  but this was not agreeable to our authors
    disposition while he was meditating a publication of all his poems in which he
    would most probably have found his account he was appointed secretary to commodore
    johnstone who  had lately obtained the command of the romney man of war in november  he
    arrived at lisbon and was named by his patron joint agent for the prizes  which
    were taken in this capital and its neighbour hood he resided more than six months
    being every where received with every mark of politeness and attention

  text: benefit societies  benefit clubtnoney besides this is one of the occasions
    societies on vev y extraordinary exertions are made by his acquaintance and friends
    especially if he is not a man thoroughly worthless whose vices not his misfortunes
    are the cause of his distress to supply him with the means and this is an exercise
    ot virtue in these acquaintances and friends which is highly useful and tends
    forcibly to the increase ot the benevolent feelings in the minds both of those
    who make it and of those in favour ot whom it is made   i   it is urged as a hardship
    of great magnitude that a man after he has been a long time a contributor to a
    club should lose the benefit of the whole tor a delay in payment at a season of
    peculiar distress but a certain degree of indulgence is allowed a detaulter does
    not forfeit till the first meeting which is a month after the quarterday besides
    it is very common to misrepresent the amount of the loss in this case what a man
    really and truly loses is that which will be necessary to place him in the same
    situation but that is only as much as will be necessary to entitle him to the
    allowances of another club this may be nine or twelve months contributions suppose
    the rate of contribution is s amonth and s of entrymoney what a man loses by expulsion
    however much he may have paid is only s if indeed he is an old man past the age
    of admission into another club what he loses is much more serious it is the value
    of all the benefit which he would have been entitled to derive and in this case
    some modification of the rule of forfeituie would be desirable it is however no
    fundamental objection because such a modification may be easily made lastly the
    number of those who suffer forfeiture from real necessity and not fiom their vices
    is small bearing a very insignificant proportion to the whole for a hardship to
    the very small number a great benefit to the very great number is not to be foregone
    this is the very principle on which bad government is distinguished from good    it
    is brought as a strong argument against benefit clubs that the meetings are held
    at publichouses from this it is inferred that the members are at these meetings
    very commonly seduced to drink and acquire increase or confirm habits of intemperance
    this appears to be an inference altogether unwarranted and contrary to the fact
    the members are in general under the necessity of holding their meetings at a
    publichouse because it is only at a publichouse where they can in general hire
    an apartment for the purpose the use of the apartment is sometimes paid for by
    the money spent which is always a limited and always a very small sum threepence
    most commonly or a pint of poiter for each  and sometimes the room is paid for
    not in this way but by the contribution of a penny or other small sum from each  and
    intoxication at the time of meeting is punished with a fine it is affirmed by
    those who have most attended to the practical proceedings of these societies that
    instead of being a source of intoxication they have been one of the grand causes
    of its decrease one decided advantage which the benefit clubs possess above the
    savings banks is that the money benefit paid to the club cannot be taken out first
    to gratify relies any unnecessary desire secondly to buy furniture for the sake
    of an early and hence in all probability a fruitful that is a deplorable marriage
    thirdly to satisfy the parish for a bastard which often would not have been gotten
    but for the reflection that if the worst came to the worst means were had to get
    rid of it in a moral point of view the formation of the people into little combinations
    and fraternities is of the greatest importance it concentrates the eyes of all
    upon each individual and renders good conduct a thing of infinitely more value
    to him as it renders bad conduct for men detrimental it is this circumstance which
    the sage mind of dr adam smith loads with such emphatic praise in the supposed
    case of the division of a country into so great a number of religious sects that
    each congregation might be regarded as differing from the rest in this manner
    without difficulty and without care is exercised one of the most vigilant and
    effectual of all censorships the most salutary of all inspections when an ignorant
    or almost any man can say to himself my conduct is regarded by nobodyit is astonishing
    how easy it is for temptation to subdue him  when he must say to himself i cannot
    perform a disgraceful act without reading aversion and contempt in the eyes of
    all my acquaintanceit is astonishing how much he is strengthened for resistance
    there is yet another thing of cardinal importance if it were possible for the
    superior to do everything for the inferior people and to leave them nothing to
    do or care about for themselves nothing would be more calamitous than the accomplishment
    of such an event the massofthehumanspeeieswould thencebecome what the people of
    paraguay became in the hand of the jesuits most perfectly helpless and ready on
    the least derangement in the machim ry which conducts them to fall into the deepest
    wretchedness and barbarity as that machinery would be liable to be deranged by
    the slightest accidents it could not be preserved in order long and would then
    serve as an introduction a necessary and certain introduction to one of the most
    deplorable conditions of human affairs the case is altogether different where
    the power of suffering for themselves is generally spread throughout the community  where
    the people have resources  where every man is accustomed to combine for himself
    the means of warding oft evil and attaining good there the machine of society
    cannot be easily disordered and human happiness is placed on a much more secure
    foundation i hen if any of the larger arteries of the body politic is obstructed

    be rendered by the smaller to a system which has thus a vis medicatrix in all

  text: coinage coinage state a few facts by way of vindicating the accuracy of mr
    lockes theory and to point out the real cause why its application to practice
    failed as it is generally acknowledged that it did  the greater portion ot the
    silver recoinage having before the year  disappeared from the circulation by an
    abstract account of the prices which the bank of england paid for gold and silver
    bullion in each year from  to  it appears that as early as  they paid l  per oz
    for standard gold and s d for standard silver and it is probable that the same
    price existed at a more early date after the recoinage though the accounts state
    no price before  this account we conceive of very great importance and we think
    will satisfactorily explain why mr lockes theory did not permanently produce the
    effect which the legislature expected from it by a reference to the prices paid
    for gold by the bank of england from  to  it appears that the average priceoz
    was l  s lid during this period the guinea was current for s d at which rate the
    oz of gold was coined into l  s d for if one guinea or  dvvts fgrs be worth s
    d  grs or  oz will be worth l  s fd it would appear then that the market price
    of gold was only d above its mint price  and some debasement by wear may have
    existed upon the gold currency at this period causing such excess of the mint
    price while the mint therefore coined gold at the rate of l s h per oz and silver
    at s d the relative proportion was as  to  there is only one quotation of silver
    given for the period in question and it is s d per oz if we take this as the average
    price for the seven years in question and we may be justified in doing so by the
    market prices which follow in  and subsequent years as extracted from castaigns
    papers and laid before the house of commons and ordered to be printed th march  at
    s sa per oz the average proportion of gold and silver in the market would be  to  but
    no individual would carry  ozs of silver to the mint to be coined into about l
    s d when these  of silver would procure an ounce of standard gold in the market
    which could be coined into l  s fd making thereby a profit of about l  s per cent
    while this profit continued it may reasonably be inferred that gold and not silver
    would be the standard of our money it was in september  that sir isaac newton
    delivered in his report to the lords of the treasury giving it as his opinion
    that gold was considerably overrated in the mint with respect to silver and in
    consequence of this report the guinea w t as by proclamation dated d december  declared
    current at s it is of importance to observe the effect produced upon the price
    of gold by this proclamation  and we are of opinion it will completely prove that
    the silver currency had not operated as the standard of value during the period
    in question when the guinea became a legal tender at s the price of gold became
    fixed at l s per oz at the mint for if  dwts f grs be worth s  grs or  oz will
    be worth l s d this  fall in the price of gold from l s d is coinage is d per
    oz and is equal to about l  s per cent it appears by the abstract of prices paid
    for bullion by the bank of england that in and subsequent years they paid l  sper
    oz for standard gold which is a fall from l s fd of is jd pier oz and if an allowance
    is made for the debasement by wear existing at this period upon the gold coin
    the fall in the market price of gold will be equal to the reduction in the value
    of the guinea but this effect could not have been produced unless gold at the
    period in question had been the measure of value and as such the measure of its
    own price from these facts we think the conclusion may be justified that from  and
    probably a more early period after the recoinage to the date of sir i newtons
    report the gold money of this country was the standard measure of property and
    that the reduction of the value of the guinea thereby making the relative proportion
    of gold and silver approximate nearer to those of the market was the first step
    of which we have an authentic record taken by government to maintain the principles
    of mr lockes theory and as the avowed intention of this report was to give that
    rise in value to the silver coin which would protect it from the melting pot and
    which could be done by lowering that of gold it may be inferred that the legislature
    were aware that the gold coin had attained the prerogative of being the standard
    of value at this time though the recommendation in sir i newtons report was carried
    into effect by making the guinea current at s yet it did not restore silver to
    its function as the standard of our money and this because the current value was
    not made still lower sir i newton seemed aware of this himself and recommended
    that lod or d should be taken from the guinea instead of d this however was not
    done and as the rate of s to the guinea the proportion of standard gold to standard
    silver at the mint was as  to  the proportion of the market as w r e find by the
    prices of gold and silver at this period in castaigns papers was about d to   which
    constitutes a difference of about  per cent gold being still thus much rated above
    its value to silver and consequently not only was no silver coined but the good
    and heavy coins were still melted for the high price they brought in the state
    of bullion it is surprising that the government having seen the operation of the
    principle recommended in the report of sir i newton did not carry it a little
    further and bring the current value of the guinea to a par with the market proportion
    of the tw r o metals and so render it the interest of the public to carry silver
    to the mint to be coined before concluding our observations upon this highly interesting
    subject we must remark that the great mr locke himself did not impute the high
    price of silver after the recoinage to the cause to which we have here assigned
    it he attributed it to the permission of exporting silver bullion and to the prohibition
    of exporting silver coin this permission he said rendered the demand for silver
    bullion greater than the demand for silver coin dr adam smith remarks upon this
    opinion that the number of

    smiths reasonings tribute to the mother country and that voluntarily  because
    the mother country may be of use to it that we may answer is a bargain not a tribute
    the mother country for example may yield a certain portion of defence but the
    colony is saved from the expence of providing for itself that defence which it
    receives from the mother country and makes a good bargain if it gets it from the
    mother country cheaper than it would be provided by itself in this case too the
    expence incurred by the mother country is apt to be a very full equivalent for
    the tribute received it is evident that this sort of bargain may subsist between
    any two states whose circumstances it may suit and is not confined to a mother
    and daughter country it is therefore no part of the question relating to colonies  we
    have now investigated the first of the modes in which a colony considered as territory
    merely may be expected to benefit the mother country  and we have seen the chances
    of good which it affords we shall now proceed to investigate the second  the trade
    by means of which it is supposed that colonies may benefit the mother country
    this is a topic of some importance  for it is on account of the trade that colonies
    have remained an object of affection to englishmen it is on account of trade solely
    that the colonies in the west indies are valued it is indeed true that some idea
    of something like a tribute from the east indies has till this time maintained
    a place in the minds of the unthinking part of the community but still it is the
    trade which has been supposed to be the principal source of the advantage which
    has been ascribed to what we call  the british empire in the east dr adam smith
    produces a long train of reasoning to prove that it never can be advantageous
    to a country to maintain colonies merely for the sake of their trade in the idea
    of deriving a peculiar advantage from the trade of the colonies is necessarily
    included the idea of monopoly if the trade of the colony were to be free other
    nations would derive as much advantage from it as the mother country  and the
    mother country would derive as much advantage from it if the colony were not a
    colony dr smith affirms that this monopoly can never be of any advantage  must
    always on the contrary be a source of great disadvantage to the mother country
    he argues thusto make the monopoly advantageous to the mother country it must
    enable the mother country to buy cheaper or sell dearer in the colony than it
    would otherwise have done in other words it must enable the mother country to
    obtain the goods of the colony for a smaller quantity of her own goods than she
    could without the monopoly this in the opinion of dr smith it does not belong
    to the monopoly to accomplish the monopoly he says may enable the mother country
    to make other nations pay dearer for the goods of the colony but it cannot enable
    her to buy them cheaper this he seems to take as a postulate without attempting
    much to support it by reasoning the extension of the market he says by which he
    must mean the vol in part i competition of capital would in a state of freedom
    reduce the profits of stock in the colonies to their lowest terms under a monopoly
    he seems to think that profit of stock in the colonies is apt to remain above
    that level and he assumes that the terms on which the mother country deals with
    the colony must depend upon the rate of profits in the colony having on these
    grounds assumed the impossibility of deriving any advantage from the monopoly
    of the colonial trade dr smith proceeds to represent a variety of disadvantages
    which he thinks it has a necessary tendency to produce his argument is that the
    monopoly of the colonial trade necessarily raises the profits of stock in the
    mother country and that  whatever to use his own expression  raises in any country
    the ordinary rate of profit higher than it otherwise would be necessarily subjects
    that country both to an absolute and to a relative disadvantage in every branch
    of trade of which she has not the monopoly to prove the first of these propositions
    he says that by the monopoly of the trade of any colony foreign capital is driven
    from it the capital of the trade is thus made deficient the profit of the capital
    is for that reason increased the increase of profit in the colony draws capital
    from the mother country the departure of capital from the mother country makes
    the portion of capital in the mother country deficient and hence raises in the
    mother country the profits of stock to prove the second of the propositions he
    says that high profits produce high prices  and that high prices diminish produce
    to afford her merchants the high profits in question the country must pay dearer
    for the goods she imports and must sell dearer those which she exports she must
    therefore he infers  both buy less and sell less  must both enjoy less and produce
    less than she otherwise would do nor is this all other nations who do not subject
    themselves to this disadvantage to this diminution of produce may advance faster
    and thus attain a superiority which they would not otherwise have enjoyed and
    there is still a worse evil  by raising the price of her produce above what it
    would otherwise be it enables the merchants of other countries to undersell her
    in foreign markets and thereby to justle her out of almost all those branches
    of trade of which she has not the monopoly to this reasoning dr smith anticipates
    an objection it may be affirmed that the colony trade is more advantageous than
    any other trade and though it may be true according to the reasonings of smith
    that the monopoly of the colony trade has diminished the amount of trade which
    the mother countrywhich england for example has been able to carry on in other
    channels england has lost nothing because she has exchanged a less profitable
    for a more profitable employment of her capital in answer to this objection dr
    smith endeavours to prove that the employment into which the capital of england
    is forced by the monopoly is less advantageous to the country than that into which
    it would have gone of its own accord as the foundation of his reasoning he assumes
    that  the most colony

    mr cleghorn after expressing his regret at having no such influence with tlie
    patrons as to secure such an arrangement added as mr ferguson sometimes related
    with much emotion u i can only say of you as hamlet did of fontinbras he has my
    dying voice mr ferguson entered on his new duties with a degree of spirit and
    activity from which the most splendid results were to be anticipated in one particular
    his mode of lecturing was singular and not easily imitated after having delineated
    the general plan of his course and committed it to writing he resolved not to
    write a system of lectures but to endeavour to make himself master of every part
    of his subject and to trust to the moment of delivery for the expression of his
    sentiments this method of discoursing was in his hands very happily executed  but
    its success depended in a great measure on the state of his health and spirits
    as well as upon the interest excited by the different subjects of discussion perhaps
    no lecturer with the exception of his immediate successor was ever more admired
    his class was crowded by great numbers of gentlemen of high rank and official
    station as well as by younger students in the mean time eagerly as he applied
    to the discharge of his professional duties his attention w r as extended to other
    branches of inquiry  and within little more than a year after he commenced his
    labours as a lecturer on morals he sent to the press his essay on the history
    of civil society  a work which was received with an expression of public applause
    which even exceeded the high expectations of his friends  fergusons book says
    mr hume writing to dr robertson from london goes on here with great success gray
    the poet says  there are uncommon strains of eloquence in it and i was surprised
    to find not one single idiom of his country i think in the whole work mr hume
    in a letter to the author dated th march  congratulates him on the success of
    the book adding that he had  met with nobody that had read it who did not praise
    it lord mansfield is very loud to that purpose in his sunday societies i heard
    lord chesterfield and lord lyttleton express the same sentiment and wffiat is
    above all caddel i am told is already projecting a second edition of the same
    quarto size mr hume then informs him that lord shelburne and lord bute were among
    his most zealous partizans the last declaring the book one of the best he ever
    read charles townshend appears to have been of the same opinion as he read it
    five times over general clerk had pressed the author to dedicate his work to lord
    shelburne who had signified his intention of offering mr ferguson the government
    of west florida upon which occasion his lordship laughed very heartily when the
    general expressed his conviction that mr ferguson was more usefully employed as
    a teacher of science the book however appeared without any dedication in the course
    of the following year lord shelburne intimated a hope of getting mr ferguson established
    with a proper appointment at oxford  and some other persons of influence meditated
    a design of employing him in one of the departments of state this puipose was
    frusvol iv part i per  trated in all probability by a temper which did ferguson
    not permit him to accommodate himself to the views of those whose maxims of conduct
    he did not entirely approve another circumstance may be considered as having also
    operated to obstruct the fulfilment of the schemes which were devised for his
    advancement at this time he married miss burnet a young lady nearly connected
    with his mothers family and still more nearly related to his intimate friend dr
    black soon afterwards he began to cultivate a farm in the parish of currie and
    at a considerable sacrifice of private interest gratified his taste for improvement
    by transforming a barren heath into a scene which became distinguished for beauty
    and fertility it was impossible however for any combination of circumstances to
    abate his literary activrty  and he not only continued to conduct the business
    of his class with unremitted diligence but seized every interval of leisure which
    he could command to collect materials for a history of the roman commonwealth
    while he was proceeding in his researches he was solicited by philip earl of stanhope
    the editor of dr robert simsons posthumous works and the other guardians of charles
    earl of chesterfield to superintend the education of that young nobleman then
    in his nineteenth year the negociation was conducted through the mediation of
    dr adam smithwho judging the offer to be advantageous to his friend exerted himself
    with great earnestness to induce him to accept it lord stanhope was extiemely
    anxious to obtain the able services of dr ferguson without delay as he conceived
    it to be of the utmost consequence to his young kinsman to be placed under the
    care of  a person so well qualified to complete the remaining part of his education
    and to repair the neglects omissions and errors which had unfortunately been committed
    in the former part of it the proposal had originally been made early in the year  and
    was renewed in december soon after the commencement of the session of the college
    when dr ferguson was engaged not only in teaching his own class but also in lecturing
    on natural philosophy the professorship of which had recently become vacant by
    the death of his relation mr russell he was not able to prevail on the patrons
    to accept of a substitute to complete the labours of that session  but after obtaining
    leave of absence for the next session he joined his young charge at geneva in
    may  and at first entertained hopes that his labours might prove beneficial the
    connection however was not so agreeable as he expected and it terminated about
    twelve months afterwards in the mean time he had very nearly been deprived of
    his office in the university the towncouncil had at his desire appointed mr john
    bruce then assistant and afterwards successor to mr stevenson to teach the moral
    philosophy during the session  and  but before the conclusion of the session they
    thought fit jto rescind this act and to declare the office vacant his friends
    in the university particularly drs robertson blair and black were exceedingly
    indignant at this proceeding more especially as sir john pringle had been permitted

    from time to time to sir william pulteney and other members of parliament and
    when it was resolved by government to send out commissioners to quiet the disorders
    in the colonies he was appointed secretary to the commission it appears from a
    letter of general putnam dated july  that the nomination of dr ferguson was very
    agreeable to the more intelligent part of the americans who not without reason
    were dissatisfied to find that the commissioners were fettered by restrictions
    which rendered their appointment nugatory  i am very sorry he writes that the

    if they think fit by which means i am deprived of seeing your friend dr ferguson
    which gives me great pain as i always have heard of his being a gentleman of the
    first character for learning good sense and humanity  it is well known that the
    commissioners returned without accomplishing the object of their mission  but
    they had an opportunity of acquiring more useful information of the state and
    temper of the country than government had received in all the previous course
    of the contest while dr ferguson was absent during the session   h  place was
    supplied by mr dugald stewart who about five years afterwards was destined to
    succeed him in the chair of moral philosophy in the year  he was seized with an
    attack of apoplexy which though not violent was sufficient to alarm his friends
    for his safety this formidable affection did not in the slightest degree impair
    the force of his understanding and so abstemious did he afterwards become as not
    only to secure himself against the recurrence of the dise ase but to enjoy almost
    uninterrupted health for more than thirty years as he could not now venture to
    lecture as formerly without the use of written notes he therefore found it necessary
    to write out a course of instruction to be read during the remainder of his incumbency
    in his endeavours torecover the substance of his lecturesj he availed himself
    of the notes taken by intellif e r gent young men who had studied under him different
    fergus sessions and who thus might be expected to have vx preserved the various
    modes in which he had staled his doctrines and the different arguments and illustrations
    by which he had happened to supply in one session what might have been omitted
    in another but in the prospect of soon relinquishing his office it was scarcely
    conceivable that the compilation which he thus executed could possess all the
    excellencies which he was capable of imparting to it more especially as he was
    now busy in carrying his great historical work through the press this was the
    history of the progress and termination of the roman republic in three volumes
    quarto published in  a book which not only delights by the clearness of its narrative
    and the boldness of its descriptions but instructs and animates by profound and
    masterly delineations of character as well as by the philosophical precision wth
    which it traces the connection of events it is written in that tone of highminded
    enthusiasm which if it can only snatch from oblivion whatever is noble and generous
    in the record of human actions regards the graces of style as o jects merely of
    secondary account and is chiefly studious of impressing the lessons of wisdom
    which may be gathered from the survey of distant ages the fatigues and anxieties
    of public teaching now became oppressive to his spirits and not altogether favourable
    to his health  and he therefore deemed it expedient to resign his office in  when
    he had completed his sixtyfirst year mr dugald stewart then professor of mathematics
    succeeded to his office and in order to entitle dr ferguson to retain his salary
    he was conjoined in the professorship of mathematics with the late lamented mr
    playfair he now proceeded to revise the notes of his lectures on ethics and politics
    with a view to publication and in  the work appeared under the title of principles
    of moral and political science though composed under disadvantageous circumstances
    and though it has omitted many of the questions which were treated in his elementary
    course it contains an admirable view of the systems both of ancient and modern
    philosophers particularly on the foundations of moral approbation and the sources
    of private happiness and public security the authors to whose suggestions he was
    most indebted were xenophon plato and aristotle among the greeks cicero and seneca
    among the latins epictetus and antoninus among the later scholars of the grecian
    school and among the moderns shaftesbury hutcheson montesquieu and adam smith
    it has been considered as a blamdable omission in this work that too slight notice
    is taken of the importance of religious principle and the author seems to have
    been aware that he had exposed himself to this objection no man however was ever
    more anxious to establish the foundations of natural theology and to strengthen
    the arguments for a future state on which subjects the work abounds in passages
    of uncommon beauty after the publication of this work dr ferguson now in his th

    the new road containing an immense population almost entirely cut olf from the
    use of fish the only arguments in favour of keeping back the fish and throwing
    them overboard is the frequent westerly wind which prevents the fishingvessels
    from proceeding to the market up the thames but that excuse is now done away by
    the numerous steamvessels which could easily tow up the fishing boats iand the
    supply as we have stated is inexhaustible id be and the means are within our reach
    of availing ourt  selves to any extent of that supply  but the de uie mand appears
    obviously to be neither so steady and certain nor so extensive as it might and
    ought to be  and hence the real cause of the failure of all the plans for extending
    the fisheries when the catch was abundant the fishermen had no home market to
    take the fish off their hands and a bad season impoverished the funds of those
    who had embarked on a larger scale for the foreign market the promoters dissatisfied
    withheld their contributions and the fishermen dispirited and without capital
    directed their industry into another channel and too frequently from their knowledge
    gained of the opposite coast and new connections formed there into a channel destructive
    to their morals and injurious to the revenue ervations the encouragement given
    by the government in hebounthe shape of bounties was not sufficient to counteract
    the evils that have been stated and appears to have contributed but little to
    the success of the fisheries if a branch of trade once fairly established will
    not support itself without being bolstered up by bounties it never can be worth
    carrying on bounties should only be continued for a definite time and decreased
    gradually those on the fisheries should be given on the quantity procured and
    the quality of those cured and not on the instrument of their productionon the
    fish and not on the vessel it was proved by a committee of the house of commons
    in  that the herringfishery absolutely cost little short of l annually which on
    an average of ten years was equal to l per cent on the value of all the fish that
    had been taken by the vessels on which it was paid adam smith has justly observed
    that a tonnagebounty proportioned to the burden of the ship and not to her diligence
    and success in the fishery is not the best stimulus to exertion  it was an encouragement
    for fitting out ships to catch not the fish but the bounty or to induce rash adventurers
    to engage in concerns which they do not understand and cause them to lose by their
    ignorance more than is gained by the liberality of government the carelessness
    ot such persons and the ignorance of those employed by them in curing and packing
    the fish not only robbed the public purse but destroyed the character of the article
    in the foreign market where if saleable at all it fetched only an inferior price
    while the skill and atteniion of the dutch secured for their fish that preference
    to which they were justly entitled ihe change of the bounty however from the tonnage
    to the quantity and the quality of the fish caught and cured with the regulations
    adopted by the acts ot th and th geo iii have had the good effect of fisheries
    raising the character and consequently increasing the demand for british fish
    in the foreign markets where the herrings in particular are now held in equal
    esteem with those of the dutch this bounty granted by the act th geo iii c  is
    s per barrel on all herrings branded by the proper officers and s a barrel granted
    by the act th geo iii c  and is so considerable that at this time it amounts to
    a sum not less than l ayear nothing can more strongly exemplify the good effects
    arising from the measure of shifting the bounty from the tonnage to the actual
    quantity of fish taken gutted and packed than the following official return for
    the year ending th april   an account of the total number of vessels including
    their repeated voyages which have been cleared outwards for the british herringfishery

    resided at home under the domestic tuition of his father till the age of fourteen
    when he entered at the university of st andrews and was almost immediately distinguished
    not merely for his singular proficiency in mathematical learning hut for the extent
    of his general knowledge the dearness of his judgment and the dignity and propriety
    of his conduct a remarkable testimony to  this effect has been lately made public
    in an early letter of the late principal george hill who was at this time one
    of his fellow students and was himself so remarkable for early talent that we
    find it retarded of him that he had privately composed an excellent sermon in
    the tenth year of his age  a youth of this description cannot be supposed to have
    been very indulgent in his estimate of the merits of bis competitors and it could
    therefore have been no ordinary measure of ability that called forth the following

    merit and more knowledge and a better judgment than any of his class fellows i

    delivering the regular lectures he used generally to delegate the task of instruction
    to his youthful pupil wilkie besides being a scholar and philosopher of no mean
    note was a man of primitive benevolence and ptegrity and of great vivacity in
    conversation and the friendship which in spite of the disparity of their years
    was speedily formed between him and young playfair speaks as much for the social
    and moral character of the latter as his substitution of him in the classroom
    does for his early p l a proficiency in science on this last subject we pfktr
    shall mention but one fact more in  when only eighteen years of age he offered
    himself with the approbation of his instructors at st andrews as candidate for
    the professorship of mathematics in mareschal college aberdeen and sustained with
    the most distinguished credit an examination or comparative trial which lasted
    eleven days and embraced nearly the whole range of the exact sciences out of the
    six competitors who entered the lists against him two only were judged to have
    excelled himthe reverend dr trail who was appointed to the office and dr hamilton
    who afterwards succeeded to and has long filled it with much reputation in  he
    removed to edinburgh where his merit and modesty very soon introduced him to the
    friendship of dr robertsonadam smithdr matthew stewartdr black and dr hutton  with
    all of whom he continued in terms of the utmost cordiality during the whole period
    of their lives in  he was a candidate for the professorship of natural philosophy
    at st andrews vacant by the death of his friend dr wilkie there was no comparative
    trial on this occasion and he was again unsuccessful under circumstances which
    have led one of the most dutiful sons of that university dr cook in his life of
    principal hill to remark  how much  it suffered in thus losing a man by whose
    talents its reputation would have been so highly promoted in the course of the
    same year the death of his father suddenly devolved upon him the burden of supporting
    the family and admonished him no longer to delay the final election of a profession
    he had been educated with a view to the church and was every way qualified to
    accept a living on the establishment but his decided predilection for science
    had hitherto made him hesitate about engaging in a vocation the duties of which
    he felt if conscientiously discharged would necessarily interfere to a great extent
    with the studies he was loth to abandon in this emergency however he thought himself
    no longer entitled to indulge in those predilectionsand accordingly made application
    to lord gray the patron for a presentation to the livings of liff and benvie which
    had been filled by his father his lordship was too well aware of his merits to
    hesitate about conferring so great a benefit on the parishioners and immediately
    issued a presentation in his favour although from some challenge of his right
    to the patronage induction was not obtained till late in the year  from this period
    till  mr playfair was constantly resident at liff and occupied almost exclusively
    with the pastoral duties of his office in this retreat his leisure hours were
    dedicated to the education of his younger brothers and to a very close and intimate
    correspondence with mr robertson now lord robertson the son of the illustrious
    historian to whom he seems to have confided the remarks that occurred to him upon
    the different authors he perused and the subjects of speculation which they suggested

    and ingenuity of his conversation though he did not himself reflect with perfect
    satisfaction upon the degree of application which he had exerted in his academical
    education he took a degree of master of arts in  having studied mathematics under
    dr robert simson and moral philosophy under dr adam smith the example of so correct
    and rigid a follower of the ancient methods of demonstration as dr simson must
    unquestionably have exercised considerable influence on his yet unformed taste
    in mathematics  but he seems to have had a natural preference either from the
    constitution of his mind or from some previously acquired habits of thinking for
    the geometrical method  for we are informed that  he first attracted the regard
    of dr simson by owning his dislike of algebra and by returning a neat geometrical
    solution of a problem which had been given out to the class in an algebraical
    form  with this mode of solution the professor was delighted though the pupil
    candidly acknowledged that it had been adopted only because he could not solve
    the problem in the manner required of the class he had imbibed in the course of
    his studies an insuperable aversion to the pursuit of his original objects in
    the church  not certainly from any want of religious feeling or from a dislike
    to the kind of life that was intended for him but probably from some difficulties
    that had occurred to him respecting particular points of doctrine or of practice
    he was therefore compelled to provide himself with some other occupation and he
    readily accepted the offers of some of his friends in  to recommend him to dr
    blair a prebendary of westminster who had formed a scheme for sending prince edward
    the young duke of york to complete his professional education at sea in company
    with a son of admiral knowles and mr robison was to have instructed his royal
    highness in mathematics and navigation he was much disappointed on his arrival
    in london to find that the expedition had never been seriously intended and he
    readily accepted an engagement to attend young knowles as a private tutor when
    he went as a midshipman on board of the neptune of  guns with admiral saunders
    who had the command of a force intended to cooperate with general wolfe in the
    reduction of quebec and upon the appointment of his friend as a lieuteroblson  nant
    on board of the royal william robison was himself rated as a midshipman in that
    ship the fleet arrived on the coast of america in april  in may they got up the
    river and mr robison was one of a party of  seamen draughted from the royal william
    into the admirals ship under the command of lieutenant knowles in this capacity
    he had an opportunity of seeing considerable service and of making some surveys
    of the river and of the neighbouring country an employment for which he was perfectly
    qualified both as a geometrician and as a draughtsman he also remarked  the effect
    of the aurora borealis on the compass which had been noticed by mairan and wargentin
    some years before but which was then not commonly known after the battle which
    was signalised by the victory and death of the gallant wolfe the royal william
    sailed with his body to europe and arrived at spithead in november the next year
    she was sent to cruise off cape finisterre but in six months she was obliged to
    return home from having the greater part of the men disabled by the scurvy he
    used to consider the two years that he spent on board of the royal william as
    the happiest of his life and no inconsiderable part of his gratification was derived
    from the study of seamanship as he saw it practised under the auspices of captain
    hugh pigot he did not however acquire any firm attachment to the mode of life
    which he had temporarily adopted he was rather disposed to resume his academical
    pursuits and he had overcome his earlier objections to the ecclesiastical profession
    he could not however refuse the friendly invitation of admiral knowles to come
    and live with him in the country and to assist him in some important experiments
    which he was making upon mechanical and nautical subjects  in the month of february  lieutenant
    knowles was appointed to the peregrine sloop of  guns and mr robison accompanied
    him with the hope of becoming a purser he visited lisbon and several other parts
    of portugal but he found a cruise in a small ship much less convenient and agreeable
    than in a large one and fortunately for himself and for mankind he finally quitted
    the peregrine and the naval service in june and returned to live with admiral
    knowles who soon after recommended him as a proper person to take charge of harrisons
    timekeeper which had been completed by the labour of  years after many unsuccessful
    experiments and which was now sent out by desire of the board of longitude to
    the west indies under the care of young harrison and of mr robison the rate of

    at port royal in jamaica a difference of time amounting to  h  m  which is only
    four seconds less than the true longitude after a few days the observers had a
    prompt opportunity of returning home by the merlin sloop which was sent to europe
    with despatches the voyage was most disastrous with respect to wind and weather

  text: 'colony  colony tribute to the mother country and that voluntarily because
    the mother country may be of use to it that we may answer is a bargain not a tribute
    the mother country for example may yield a certain portion of defence but the
    colony is saved from the expence of providing for itself that defence which it
    receives from the mother country and makes a good bargain if it gets it from the
    mother country cheaper than it would be provided by itself in this case too the
    expence incurred by the mother country is apt to be a very full equivalent for
    the tribute received it is evident that this sort of bargain may subsist between
    any two states whose circumstances it may suit and is not confined to a mother
    and daughter country it is therefore no part of the question relating to colonies
    inquiry as  we have now investigated the first of the to the admodes in which
    a colony considered as territory vantages to merely may be expected to benefit
    the mother trade b  v country  and we have seen the chances of good which it affords
    we shall now proceed to investigate the second  the trade by means of which it
    is supposed that colonies may benefit the mother country this is a topic of some
    importance  for it is on account of the trade that colonies have remained an object
    of affection to englishmen it is on account of trade solely that the colonies
    in the west indies are valued it is indeed true that some idea of something like
    a tribute from the east indies has till this time maintained a place in the minds
    of the unthinking part of the community but still it is the trade which has been
    supposed to be the principal source of the advantage which has been ascribed to
    what we call  the british empire in the east dr adam smith produces a long train
    of reasoning to prove that it never can be advantageous to a country to maintain
    colonies merely for the sake of their trade view of dr l n the idea of deriving
    a peculiar advantage from smuhs  tra j e  f t h e colonies is necessarily included
    the easomngs  jf t  ie trade of the colony were to be free other nations would
    derive as much advantage from it as the mother country  and the mother country
    would derive as much advantage from it if the colony were not a colony dr smith
    affirms that this monopoly can never be of any advantage  must always on the contrary
    be a source of great disadvantage to the mother country he argues thusto make
    the monopoly advantageous to the mother country it must enable the mother country
    to buy cheaper or sell dearer in the colony than it would otherwise have done
    in other words it must enable the mother country to obtain the goods of the colony
    for a smaller quantity of her own goods than she could without the monopoly this
    in the opinion of dr smith it does not belong to the monopoly to accomplish the
    monopoly he says may enable the mother country to make other nations pay dearer
    for the goods of the colony but it cannot enable her to buy them cheaper this
    he seems to take as a postulate without attempting much to support it by reasoning
    the extension of the market he says by which he must mean the vol nr part i competition
    of capital would in a state of freedom cwony reduce the profits of stock in the
    colonies to their lowest terms under a monopoly he seems to think that profit
    of stock in the colonies is apt to remain above that level and he assumes that
    the terms on which the mother country deals with the colony must depend upon the
    rate of profits in the colony having on these grounds assumed the impossibility
    of deriving any advantage from the monopoly of the colonial trade dr smith proceeds
    to represent a variety of disadvantages which he thinks it has a necessary tendency
    to produce his argument is that the monopoly of the colonial trade necessarily
    raises the profits of stock in the mother country  and that  whatever to use his
    own expression  raises in any country the ordinary rate of profit higher than
    it otherwise would be necessarily subjects that country both to an absolute and
    to a relative disadvantage in every branch of trade of which she has not the monopoly
    to prove the first of these propositions he says that by the monopoly of the trade
    of any colony foreign capital is driven from it the capital of the trade is thus
    made deficient the profit of the capital is for that reason increased the increase
    of profit in the colony draws capital from the mother country the departure of
    capital from the mother country makes the portion of capital in the mother country
    deficient and hence raises in the mother country the profits of stock to prove
    the second of the propositions he says that high profits produce high prices and
    that high prices diminish produce to afford her merchants the high profits in
    question the country must pay dearer for the goods she imports and must sell dearer
    those which she exports she must therefore he infers  both buy less and sell less  must
    both enjoy less and produce less than she otherwise would do nor is this all other
    nations who do not subject themselves to this disadvantage to this diminution
    of produce may advance faster and thus attain a superiority which they would not
    otherwise have enjoyed and there is still a worse evil  by raising the price of
    her produce above what it would otherwise be it enables the merchants of other
    countries to undersell her in foreign markets and thereby to justle her out of
    almost all those branches of trade of which she has not the monopoly to this reasoning
    dr smith anticipates an objection it may be affirmed that the colony trade is
    more advantageous than any other trade and though it may be true according to
    the reasonings of smith that the monopoly of the colony trade has diminished the
    amount of trade which the mother country r which england for example has been
    able to carry on in other channels england has lost nothing because she has exchanged
    a less profitable for a more profitable employment of her capital in answer to
    this objection dr smith endeavours to prove that the employment into which the
    capital of england is forced by the monopoly is less advantageous to the country
    than that into which it would have gone of its own accord as the foundation of
    his reasoning he assumes that  the most l '

  text: economists conomists concerned there is no balance of opposite forces  the
    forces combine instead of opposing and so far the balance is lost the loss of
    the balance to this extent may be a loss engrossing the whole of the protection
    to the common interest which it was expected to yield  or it may be a loss not
    extending so far if it goes to the whole extent of that protection there is to
    the purpose in question no balance at all if it does not go to the whole extent
    there will still be some balance more or less what then is the case  the case
    is that the loss goes to the whole and that the balance does not exist the balance
    does not exist as far as the private interests of those who share among them the
    governing powers are concerned but it is only from the private interests of those
    who govern that the nation has any thing to fear it is only against these interests
    that the balance is provided as far however as these private interests are concerned
    the balance does not exist as far therefore as the balance is even supposed to
    be of any service the balance is excluded by the law of nature it follows as a
    corollary that in a country where the people depend upon what is called a balance
    as the whole of their security for good government they have no security at all
    such is the analysis which the economists present of the causes of good and evil
    in human society and of that order of things which best insures the presence of
    the one and the absence of the other that part of their doctrine which alone is
    yet known to the mere english reader their political economy is introduced as
    only an auxiliary exposition it is part of the developement by which they endeavoured
    to prove the identity which they supposed between the interests of the sovereign
    and the interests of the people but as a very distinct account of this part of
    their system has been given by dr adam smith and has been repeated in a variety
    of publications  and as our object rather was the exhibition of those doctrines
    of the sect which nobody has yet presented to our countrymen in their own language
    we shall content ourselves with only marking the place which their political economy
    held in their general system as the society has public expences it is necessary
    that it also have a public revenue to reconcile the formation of a public revenue
    with the idea of social order it ought to be formed if possible without infringing
    the property of individuals for the sake of which the order of society itself
    is established it ought therefore if possible to be formed without diminishing
    the revenue of individuals when the real origin of revenue the source from which
    it all is drawn is sufficiently understood the mode of forming a revenue for the
    sovereign without diminishing that of individuals would be immediately apparent
    the source of all riches is the land  because the land alone of all the sources
    of production yields a produce greater than the cost of the production the surplus
    produce of the land therefore constitutes a fund which is over and above t ie
    remuneration to the agents of production and out o w nch the revenue of the sovereign
    may be taken without diminishing the motive to production that is without retarding
    the natural progress of the economics state in wealth population and felicity  to
    lay the foundation for this plan of a public revenue it was necessary to prove
    that the land is the only source of production  and that manufactures and ctminferce
    though they alter the form of things never add any thing to the amount or value
    of production in the developement of these views one of the most remarkable results
    at which the economists arrived was the necessity of perfect freedom to all the
    proceedings which lead to production as giving to produce that form which is most
    agreeable to those who are to make use of it till th time of the economists the
    necessity of holding those proceedings in chains and binding them to the wall
    of governments was the universal doctrine of governments and to a great degree
    of speculators themselves the general principles of the economists respecting
    the freedom of property necessary to constitute the foundation of social order
    led them to infer the evil of those abridgments of freedom  but they examined
    the inference in detail and showed that the meddling officiousness of governments
    to compel industry to one thing and exclude it from another not only failed to
    effect any good purposes but of necessity created obstructions of the greatest
    magnitude to production in general and tended powerfully to keep down the wealth
    population and prosperity of the state the light which they diffused on this subject
    and which soon produced a grand effect on the minds of men was a good the magnitude
    of which is beyond calculation another of their conclusions is that the revenue
    of the sovereign taken as they said it ought to be wholly from the net produce
    of the land ought to be a fixed and unalterable proportion of that produce the
    reason appeared to them conclusive if the proportion was variable and depended
    upon the will of the owners of the land they might be induced to break upon the
    public revenue and deprive the state of those benefits which the public revenue
    is necessary to produce if it depended upon the sovereign the property of the
    land might be detached from that of its produce  no body would have a motive to
    become a proprietor in land and all the advantages wdiich depend on the existence
    of that property would be lost the production of subsistence would fail and the
    community could not exist this proportion being once fixed there is no longer
    any contrariety between the interest of the sovereign and the interest of any
    portion of his people and the proprietors of land are as completely and securely
    exempt from contributing to the expence of the state as any other class of the
    community the sovereign derives no part of his revenue from the subject and this
    deplorable source of the conflict of interests is wholly cut off the proportion
    being settled for ever between the sovereign and the landowners that alone is
    the property of the landowner which is the proportion remaining to him  he rest
    is with regard to him as if it did not exist the sovereign they denominated therefore
    co pro prietor ot the land and between him and the ianucwner commonly so called
    a perfect community of interests is fixed it is the interest of the sovereign
    that the produce of the land should in

  text: econo economists dian of its own laws because there is in the nation no power
    comparable to that which results tiom the combination of its powers again in contending
    that the legislative and executive powers must always be exercised by the same
    hands they affirm that those powers could only be exercised by those who had in
    their hands the superiority of the physical force observe now the legitimate conclusion     the
    people alone have the physical force necessary to constitute them guardians of
    the laws the same force is necessary for the makers and the executors of the laws
    no body therefore but the people ever can accurately speaking have either the
    legislative or the executive powersin a state of ignorance they may be led by
    fraud to lend their powers to their own destruction but it is a part also of the
    doctrine of the economists that in a state of knowledge in which they may be easily
    placed it is not possible they should make any but a good use of their power  a
    nation they said  governed according to the natural and essential order of society
    has necessarily the perfect evidence and knovyledge of it and therefore sees with
    certainty that it enjoys its best possible situation this perception of necessity
    unites all the wills and all the forces in the nation for the support of that
    order and by consequence for the creation and preservation of all the institutions
    which are best adapted to that support the people therefore may be safely trusted
    in a nation governed badly governed not according to  the natural and essential
    order but according to what the economists called the  political order it is always
    they said  one part of the nation which governs the rest the weaker which governs
    the stronger in this case too the power of him who commands consists in nothing
    but the powers united of those who obey him and this union of their forces supposes
    of necessity the union of their wills which can be founded only upon the persuasion
    that this obedience procures them their best possible condition the powers of
    the nation in this vicious order are less at the disposal of the sovereign than
    at the disposal of those who hire to him their agency and by consequence sell
    to him the means of procuring obedience from the nation his situation is therefore
    at bottom a real dependence his situation is precarious uncertain changeable he
    is put in chains which he dares not attempt to break in every situation therefore
    it is the will of the people either of the whole of the people united or of a
    part of the people united against the rest which is in reality both the legislative
    and the executive power estimate therem i s ts fore as high as you please exaggerate
    to any excess economist the inconvenience of being governed by the people you
    have that inconvenience still you are bound to it by the inexorable law of nature
    it is not within the range of possibility that you should escape from it we have
    already seen that the economists declare that  every man wishes to have all the
    rights on his own side all the duties on the side of other men  that every man
    likes inequality in short when the inequality is in his own power from this they
    infer that the community cannot safely govern  but from this it may with much
    more justness be retorted upon them that nothing else can safely govern the interest
    of the community say the economists is easily known  the evidence of it is within
    the reach of all descriptions of the people and so cogent as to be irresistible
    the union of wills according to their doctrine follows as a matter of course here
    therefore it should seem w e have a much better security than can be found in
    the interest of any individual sovereign or subordinate it is remarkable enough
    that the economists have wholly overlooked in their criticism on the pians opposed
    to their own the representative systen  and yet it is pretty evident that it is
    by means ot the representative system that the grand problem of government must
    finall be resolved the speculations connected with this subject will however find
    a more fitting place under the article government for the exposition of the original
    errors of this sect in political economy it is unnecessary to do any thing more
    than refer to the immortal work of dr adam smith a few years ago these errors
    under something of a new form were revived in this country with a success which
    shows how much the opinions of that great proportion of the community whose opinions
    are not formed upon evidence are liable to change by every fluctuation of circumstances
    from an opinion which had governed this nation for ages that to its commerce alone
    it owed its being the richest nation upon earth our countrymen under the momentary
    threat of circumstances which created an unreasonable fear of being deprived of
    commerce embraced with an avidity hardly conceivable before experience the doctrine
    of mr spence that commerce was no source of riches at all what the author of this
    article thought necessary to be said in opposition to these doctrines at the time
    he presented in a tract entitled commerce defended in answer to mr spence  and
    an able exposure of the same errors was published on the same occasion by major
    torrens in a pamphlet which he entitled the economists rejuted f f  the only part
    of mr mills pamphlet to which it is of any use at present particularly to refer
    is where he proves that a balance necessarily exists between production and consumption
    and that no amount of production can ever be without a market a doctrine of cardinal
    importance first illustrated by m say in his very able work entitled traite deconomic

    in its fullest extent and many of its fundamental principles placed beyond the
    reach of cavil and dispute in opposition to the french economists dr smith showed
    that labour is the only source of wealth and that the desire inherent in the breast
    of every individual to improve his fortune and rise in the world is the cause
    of its accumulation he next traced the means by which the powers of labour may
    be rendered most effective and showed that it is productive of wealth when employed
    in manufactures and commerce as well as when employed in the cultivation of the
    land having established these principles dr smith showed in opposition to the
    commonly received opinions of the merchants politicians and statesmen of his time
    that wealth did not consist in the abundance of gold and silver but in the abundance
    of the various necessaries conveniencies and enjoyments of human life he showed
    that individuals are always the best judges of what is for their own interest
    and tliat in prosecuting branches of industry advantageous to themselves they
    necessarily prosecute such as are advantageous to the public  from thence dr smith
    drew his grand inference that every regulation intended to force industry into
    particular channels or to determine the species of commercial intercourse to be
    carried on between different parts of the same country or between distant and
    independent countries is impolitic and perniciousinjurious to the rights of individualsand
    adverse to the progress of real opulence and lasting prosperity i he fact that
    traces of most of these principles and even that the distinct statement of many
    of those that are most important may be found in the works of previous writers
    does not in the least detract from the real merits of dr smith in adopting the
    discoveries of others he has made them his own  he economy has demonstrated the
    truth of principles on which his predecessors had in most cases stumbled by chance  has
    disentangled and separated them from the errors oy which they were incumbered  has
    traced their remote consequences and pointed out their limitations  has shown
    their practical importance and real valuetheir mutual dependence and relation
    and has reduced them into a consistent harmonious and magnificent system we do
    not mean to say that dr smith has produced a perfect work undoubtedly there are
    errors and those too of no slight importance in the wealth of nations the principles
    to which we have just referred and which form the basis of the work are unimpeachable  but
    dr smith has not always reasoned correctly from them and he has occasionally introduced
    others which a more careful observation and analysis has shown to be illfounded
    but after every allowance has been made for these defects enough still remains
    to justify us in considering dr smith as the real founder of the science if he
    has not left us a perfect work he has at all events left us one which contains
    a greater mass of useful and universally interesting truths than has ever been
    given to the world by any other individual and he has pointed out and smoothed
    the route by following which subsequent philosophers have been enabled to perfect
    much that he had left incomplete to rectify the mistakes into which he had fallen
    and to make many new and important discpveries whether indeed we refer to the
    soundness of its leading doctrines to the liberality and universal applicability
    of its practical conclusions or to the powerful and beneficial influence it has
    had on the progress and perfection of economical science and still more on the
    policy and destiny of nations dr fcimith s work must be placed in the foremost
    rank of those that have done most to liberalise enlighten and enrich mankind  wealth
    of nations the practical part of the science of political ecodistinction nomy
    was long confounded with that of politics and between it is undoubtedly true that
    they are very intimately p  h t l cs  an  i connected and that it is frequently
    impossible to economy treat those questions which strictly belong to the one without
    referring more or less to the principles and conclusions of the other but in their
    leading features they are sufficiently distinct the laws which regulate the production
    and distribution of wealth are the same in every country and stage of society
    those circumstances which are favourable or unfavourable to the increase of riches
    and population in a republic may equally exist and will have che fa arrichire
    chi ha inlrapresa la fabbrica e chi vi simpiega con felice tzlentomeditazioni
    sulla economia pohiica    it is of importance to observe that dr smith does not
    say that in prosecuting such branches of industry as are most advantageous to
    themselves individuals necessarily prosecute such as are at the same time most
    advantageous to the public his leaning to the system of the economistsa leaning
    perceptible in every part of his workmade him so far swerve from the principles
    of his own system as to admit that individual advantage was not always a true
    test of the public advantageousness of different employments he considered agriculture
    though not the only productive employment the most productive of any he also considered
    the home trade as more productive than a direct foreign trade and the latter than
    the carrying trade we shall hereafter show that there is no foundation for these
    distinctions vol vi part i off

    q n which very extraordinary exertions are made by ac q ua j n t ance an d friends
    especially it he is not a man thoroughly worthless whose vices not nis misfortunes
    are the cause ot his distress to supply him with the means and this is an exercise
    ot virtue in these acquaintances and friends which is highly useful and tends
    forcibly to the increase of the benevolent feelings in the minds both of those
    who make it and of those in favour of whom it is made it is urged as a hardship
    of great magnitude that a man after he has been a long time a contributor to a
    club should lose the benefit of the whole for a delay in payment at a season of
    peculiar distress but a certain degree of indulgence is allowed a defaulter does
    not forfeit till the first meeting which is a month after the quarterday besides
    it is veiy common to misrepresent the amount ot the loss in this case what a man
    really and truly loses is that which will be necessary to place him in the same
    situation but that is only as much as will be necessary to entitle him to the
    allowances of another club this may be nine or twelve months contributions suppose
    the rate of contribution is s amonth and s of entrymoney what a man loses by expulsion
    however much he may have paid is only s if indeed he is an old man past the age
    of admission into another club what he loses is much more serious it is the value
    of all the benefit which he would have been entitled to derive and in this case
    some modification of the rule of forfeituie w r ould be desirable it is however
    no fundamental objection because such a modification may be easily made lastly
    the number of those who suffer forfeiture from real necessity and not from their
    vices is small bearing a very insignificant propoition to the whole for a hardship
    to the very small number a great benefit to the very great number is not to be
    foregone ibis is the very principle on which bad government is distinguished from
    good   it is brought as a strong argument against benefit clubs that the meetings
    are held at publichouses from this it is inferred that the members are at these
    meetings very commonly seduced to drink and acquire increase or confirm habits
    of intemperance this appears to be an inference altogether unwarranted and contrary
    to the fact i he combers are in general under the necessity of holding their meetings
    at a publichouse because it is only at a publichouse where they can in general
    hire an apartment for the purpose the use of the apaitment is sometimes paid for
    by the money spent which is always a limited and always a very small sum threepence
    most commonly or a pint of porter for each  and sometimes the room is paid for
    not in this way but by the contribution ot a penny or other small sum from each  and
    intoxication at the time of meeting is punished with a fine it is affirmed by
    those who have most attended to the practical proceedings of these societies that
    instead of being a source of intoxication they have been one of the grand causes
    of its decrease one decided advantage which the benefit clubs o c i e t i e s
    possess above the savings banks is that the money benefit paid to the club cannot
    be taken out first to gratify societi any unnecessary desire secondly to buy furniture
    for the sake of an early and hence in all probability a fruitful that is a deplorable
    marriage thirdly to satisfy the parish for a bastard which often would not have
    been gotten but for the reflection that if the worst came to the worst means were
    had to get rid of it in a moral point of view the formation of the people into
    little combinations and fraternities is of the greatest importance it concentrates
    the eyes of all upon each individual and renders good conduct a thing of infinitely
    more value to him as it renders bad conduct for men detrimental it is this circumstance
    which the sage mind of dr adam smith loads with such emphatic praise in the supposed
    case of the division of a country into so great a number of religious sects that
    each congregation might be regarded as differing from the rest in this manner
    without difficulty and without care is exeicised one of the most vigilant and
    effectual of all censorships the most salutary of all inspections w hen an ignorant
    or almost any man can say to himself my conduct is regarded by nobodyit is astonishing
    how easy it is for temptation to subdue him  when he must say to himself i cannot
    perform a disgraceful act without reading aversion and contempt in the eyes of
    all my acquaintanceit is astonishing how much he is strengthened for resistance
    there is yet another thing of cardinal importance if it were possible for the
    superior to do everything for the inferior people and to leave them nothing to
    do or care about for themselves nothing w ould be more calamitous than the accomplishment
    of such an event the mass of the human species would thence become what the people
    of paraguay became in the hand of the jesuits  most perfectly helpless and ready
    on the least derangement in the machinery which conducts them to fall into the
    deepest wretchedness and barbarity as that machinery would be liable to be deranged
    by the slightest accidents it could not be preserved in order long and would then
    serve as an introduction a necessary and certain introduction to one of the most
    deplorable conditions of human affairs the case is altogether different where
    the power of suffering for themselves is generally spread throughout the community  where
    the people have resources  where every man is accustomed to combine for himself
    the means of warding off evil and attaining good there the machine of society
    cannot be easily disordered and human happiness is placed on a much more secure
    foundation then if any of the larger arteries of the body politic is obstructed
    the nourishment of the system is carried on by the admirable service which may
    be rendered by the smaller to a system which has thus a vis medicatrix in all
    its parts no shock can be given that is not immediately repaired w r ere the greatest
    d lsor  der introduced things of their own accord would hasten to their proper

    in considerable affluence on his estate at boghall not far from that city he was
    of a family sufficiently respectable to enable his son at a subsequent period
    to prove himself to the satisfaction of the court of st petersburg a gentleman
    born as a younger brother that son was originally intended for the church and
    went at an early age according to the custom of scotland in  to enter as a student
    of humanity in the university of glasgow so that he was initiated almost in the
    rudiments of latin and greek literature under the able instruction of dr moore
    the well known professor of greek and he acquired such a knowledge of these languages
    as served to constitute him a correct classical scholar through life he pursued
    his studies with so much attention as to obtain the approbation of his teachers
    and the admiration of his contemporaries who were delighted with the originality
    and ingenuity of his conversation though he did not himself reflect with perfect
    satisfaction upon the degree of application which he had exerted in his academical
    education he took a degree of master of arts in  having studied mathematics under
    dr robert simson and moral philosophy under dr adam smith the example of so correct
    and rigid a follower of the ancient methods of demonstration as dr simson must
    unquestionably have exercised considerable influence on his yet unformed taste
    in mathematics  but he seems to have had a natural preference either from the
    constitution ot his mind or from some previously acquired habits of thinking for
    the geometrical method  for we are informed that  he first attracted the regard
    of dr simson by owning his dislike of algebra and by returning a neat geometrical
    solution of a problem which had been given out to the class in an algebraical
    form  with this mode of solution the professor was delighted though the pupil
    candidly acknowledged that it had been adopted only because he could not solve
    the problem in the manner required of the class  he had imbibed in the course
    of his studies an insuperable aversion to the pursuit of his original objects
    in the church  not certainly from any want of religious feeling or from a dislike
    to the kind of life that was intended for him but probably from some difficulties
    that had occurred to him respecting particular points of doctrine or of practice
    was therefore compelled to provide himself with some other occupation and he readily
    accepted the offers of some of his friends in  to recommend him to dr blair a
    prebendary of westminster who had formed a scheme for sending prince edward the
    young duke of york to complete his professional education at sea in company with
    a son of admiral knowles and mr robison was to have instructed his royal highness
    in mathematics and navigation he was much disappointed on his arrival in london
    to find that the expedition had never been serious y intended and he readily accepted
    an engagement to attend young knowles as a private tutor when he went as a midshipman
    on board of the neptune   guns with admiral saunders who had the command of a
    force intended to cooperate wit  eneral wolfe in the reduction of quebec and r
    o b  upon the appointment of his friend as a lieutekobl nant on board of the royal
    william robison was himself rated as a midshipman in that ship the fleet arrived
    on the coast of america in april  in may they got up the river and mr robison
    was one of a party of  seamen draughted from the royal william into the admirals
    ship under the command of lieutenant knowles in this capacity he had an opportunity
    of seeing considerable service and of making some surveys of the river and of
    the neighbouring country an employment for which he was perfectly qualified both
    as a geometrician and as a draughtsman he also remarked the effect of the aurora
    borealis on the compass which had been noticed by mairan and wargentin some years
    before but which was then not commonly known after the battle which was signalised
    by the victory and death of the gallant wolfe the royal william sailed with his
    body to europe and arrived at spithead in november the next year she was sent
    to cruise off cape finisterre but in six months she was obliged to return home
    from having the greater part of the men disabled by the scurvy he used to consider
    the two years that he spent on board of the royal william as the happiest of his
    life and no inconsiderable part of his gratification was derived from the study
    of seamanship as he saw it practised under the auspices of captain hugh pigot
    he did not however acquire any firm attachment to the mode of life which he had
    temporarily adapted he was rather disposed to resume his academical pursuits and
    he had overcome his earlier objections to the ecclesiastical profession he could
    not however refuse the friendly invitation of admiral knowles to come and live
    with him in the country and to assist him in some important experiments which
    he was making upon mechanical and nautical subjects in the month of february  lieutenant
    knowles was appointed to the peregrine sloop of  guns and mr robison accompanied
    him with the hope of becoming a purser he visited lisbon and several other parts
    of portugal but he found a cruise in a small ship much less convenient and agreeable
    than in a large one and fortunately for himself and for mankind he finally quitted
    the peregrine and the naval service in june and returned to live with admiral
    knowles who soon after recommended him as a proper person to take charge of harrisons
    timekeeper which had been completed by the labour of  years after many unsuccessful
    experiments and which was now sent out by desire of the board of longitude to

    at port royal in jamaica a difference of time amounting to  h  m  which is only
    four seconds less than the true longitude after a few days the observers had a

  text: 'e c o n  m i s t s economists fulness of happiness hitherto altogether unknown
    at this point therefore we may close the historical part of this article for the
    success of the great work of dr adam smith in a short time superseded the political
    economy of the sect and after the political economy was discredited the rest of
    their doctrines met with little regard the memory of them however is well worthy
    of being preserved  and this task we shall now in as few words as possible endeavour
    to perform ii the economists proceeded upon no utopian plan which supposes society
    to be composed of beings different from those with whom we are already acquainted
    they took man as he isa being having wants and governed by the desire of avoiding
    pain and obtaining pleasure man must have subsistence upon this ground they first
    took their stand this being allowed it jfollowed of course that whatever was the
    best means of obtaining subsistence would command the operations of men as soon
    as ever it was sufficiently known of these means the first and fundamental is
    the establishment of property this they proved by convincing arguments we cannot
    exist without consuming the nature of roan leads to a rapid multiplication of
    human beings and the earth yields a spontaneous nourishment for only a few to
    make food keep pace with population labour must be employed upon the ground men
    would be born for no other purpose than that of destroying one another if there
    were not means of increasing the quantity of food in proportion to those that
    were born labour then is one of the physical necessities of nature but if labour
    be necessary so is property because without property there can be no labour the
    proof of this proposition is short and irresistible nobody would labour under
    an assurance that he would derive no advantage from his labour nobody would labour
    without a certain probability that he should enjoy the fruits of his labour now
    this is property the only question then which remains is what is the degree of
    assurance with respect to the fruits of a mans labour  in other words what are
    the laws of property which tend most to secure the benefits which human beings
    derive from their labour  this said the economists is the object and the end of
    our researches they proceeded in their inquiry by the following steps as a means
    to this labour on which every thing depends a man must be free to use his natural
    faculties of labourhis muscular powers this freedom they called the property of
    his person as another means to the same end he must be free to use exclusively
    and to preserve what he acquires by his labour this they called his moveable property
    here we see the origin of that to which men have assigned the names of rights
    and duties the exclusive powers assigned to the man over his person and oyer the
    fruits of his labour are called his rights lo allow these exclusive powers by
    abstaining from every act which would impair them is called the duties of all
    other men here we see also that rights and duties are reciprocal that they imply
    one aneconomists other that they are created together  and that the one cannot
    exist without the other destroy the rights of property in the man you destroy
    by the same act the duties of other men to exclude themselves from what was called
    his property destroy in the same manner the duties of other men to exclude themselves
    from what was called his property and you destroy at the same time his right to
    that exclusion rights and duties ar e in fact but different names given to the
    same thing according as it is regarded under one or another of two points of view
    another important concatenation is here also to be seen rights are advantages  things
    to be en joyed duties are burthens abstracted from things to be enjoyed why should
    men accept these burthens submit to these duties  why  but because they find their
    advantage in doing so it is plain how they find their advantage in doing so and
    there is there can be no other reason men submit to the duties of respecting other
    mens rights that they may have rights themselves it is good for them to have rights  there
    can be no rights without duties it is better to have the rights submitting to
    the duties than by renouncing the duties to have no rights the duties are then
    the price which is paid for the rights the duties which one man yields to other
    men are the price which he pays for having rights of his own duties then are in
    themselves evils  and they never ought to exist except when they are compensated
    by a greater good nobody ought to be subjected to a burthen which is not either
    to himself or to the community in which he has clubbed his private interests attended
    with a good sufficiently great to overbalance the evil which he is made to endure
    utility then is the exclusive foundation of duty having laid this foundation the
    economists proceed on the necessity of subsistence rests the necessity of property
    and on the necessity of property rests the necessity of a certain inequality in
    the conditions of men this inequality exists because a good is obtained through
    it which can in no other way be obtained  and that good the parent of every thing
    else to which the name of good is applied f those who complain of it says mercier
    de la riviere one of the chief expositors of the doctrines of the sect  see not
    that it is a link in the chain by which the human species must drag from the abyss
    of nonproduction every thing which they enjoy as soon as i have acquired the exclusive
    property of a thing another man cannot have the property of it at the same time
    the law of property is the same for all men  each man however acquires in proportion
    to his faculties of acquiring but the measure of these is different in different
    men and besides this fundamental law there is in the whirlpool of accidents a
    continual succession of combinations some more some less fortunate which increase
    the causes ol that inequality of acquisition without which the motives to acquisition
    cannot exist   admit however he in conclusion adds  that in any given community
    these differences in the '

    powers are concerned but it is   y from the private interests of those who govern
    that the nation has any thing to fear it is only against these interests that
    the balance is provided as tar however as these private interests are concerned
    the balance does not exist as far therefore as the balance is even supposed to
    be of any service the balance is excluded by the law of nature it follows as a
    corollary that in a country where the people depend upon what is called a balance
    as the whole of their security for good government they have no security at all
    such is the analysis which the economists present of the causes of good and evil
    in human society and of that order of things which best insures the presence of
    the one and the absence of the other that part of their doctrine which alone is
    yet known to the mere english reader their political economy is introduced as
    only an auxiliary exposition it is part of the developement by which they endeavoured
    to prove the identity which they supposed between the interests of the sovereign
    and the interests of the people but as a very distinct account of this part of
    their system has been given by dr adam smith and has been repeated in a variety
    of publications  and as our object rather was the exhibition oi those doctrines
    of the sect which nobody has yet presented to our countrymen in their own language
    we shall content ourselves with only marking the place which their political economy
    held in their general system as the society has public expences it is necessary
    that it also have a public revenue to reconcile the formation of a public revenue
    with the idea of social order it ought to be formed if possible without infringing
    the property of individuals for the sake of which the order of society itself
    is established it ought therefore if possible to be formed without diminishing
    the revenue of individuals when the real origin of revenue the source from which
    it all is drawn is sufficiently understood the mode of forming a revenue for the
    sovereign without diminishing that of individuals would be immediately apparent
    the source of all riches is the land because the land alone of all the sources
    of production yields a produce greater than the cost of the production the surplus
    produce of the land therefore constitutes a fund which is over and above the remuneration
    to the agents of production and out of which the revenue of the sovereign may
    be taken without diminishing the motive to production that m i s t s is without
    retarding the natural progress of the economists state in wealth population and
    felicity to lay the foundation for this plan of a public revenue it was necessary
    to prove that the land is the only source of production  and that manufactures
    and commerce though they alter the form of things never add any thing to the amount
    or value of production in the developement of these views one of the most remarkable
    results at which the economists arrived was the necessity of perfect freedom to
    all the proceedings which lead to production as giving to produce that form which
    is most agreeable to those w ho are to make use of it till the time of s the economists
    the necessity of holding those proceedings in chains and binding them to the will
    of governments was the universal doctrine of governments and to a great degree
    of speculators themselves the general principles of the economists respecting
    the freedom of property necessary to constitute the foundation of social order
    led them to infer the evil of those abridgments of freedom  but they examined
    the inference in detail and showed that the meddling officiousness of governments
    to compel industry to one thing and exclude it from another not only vailed to
    effect any good purposes but of necessity created obstructions of the greatest
    magnitude to production in general and tended powerfully to keep down the wealth
    papulation and prosperity of the state the light which they diffused on this subject
    and which soon produced a grand effect on the minds of men was a good the magnitude
    of which is beyond calculation another of their conclusions is that the revenue
    of the sovereign taken as they said it ought to be wholly from the net produce
    of the land oughtto be a fixed and unalterable proportion of that produce the
    reason appeared to them conclusive if the proportion was variable and depended
    upon the will of the owners of the land they might be induced to break upon the
    public revenue and deprive the state of those benefits which the public revenue
    is necessary to produce if it depended upon the sovereign the property of the
    land might be detached from that of its produce  no body would have a motive to
    become a proprietor in land and all the advantages which depend on the existence
    of that property would be lost the production of subsistence would fail and the
    community could not exist this proportion being once fixed there is no longer
    any contrariety between the interest of the sovereign and the interest of any
    portion of his people and the proprietors of land are as completely and securely
    exempt from contributing to the expence of the state as any other class of the
    community the sovereign derives no part of his revenue from the subject and this
    deplorable source of the conflict of interests is wholly cut off the proportion
    being settled for ever between the sovereign and the landowners that alone is
    the property of the landowner which is the proportion remaining to him the rest
    is with regard to him as if it did not exist the sovereign they denominated therefore
    coproprietor of the land and between him and the landowner commonly so called
    a perfect community of interests is fixed it is the interest of the sovereign
    that the produce of the land should in

    no power comparable to that which results irom the combination of its powers again  in
    contending that the legislative and executive powers must always be exercised
    by the same hands they affirm that those powers could only be exexcised by those
    who had in their hands the superiority of the physical force observe now the legitimate
    conclusion the people alone have the physical force necessary to constitute them
    guardians of the laws the same force is necessary for the makers and the executors
    of the laws no body therefore but the people ever can accurately speaking have
    either the legislative or the executive powersin a state of ignorance they may
    be led by fraud to lend their powers to their own destruction but it is a part
    also of the doctrine of the economists that in a state of knowledge in which they
    may be easily placed it is not possible they should make any but a good use of
    their power  a nation they said  governed according to the natural and essential
    order of society has necessarily the perfect evidence and knowledge of it and
    therefore sees with certainty that it enjoys its best possible situation this
    perception of necessity unites all the wills and all the forces in the nation
    for the support of that order and by consequence for the creation and preservation
    of all the institutions which are best adapted to that support the people therefore
    may be safely trusted in a nation governed badl governed not according to  the
    natural and essential order but according to what the economists called the  political
    order it is always they said  one part of the nation which governs the rest the
    weaker which governs the stronger in this case too the power of him who commands
    consists in nothing but the powers united of those who obey him and this union
    of their forces supposes of necessity the union of their wills which can be founded
    only upon the persuasion that this obedience procures them their best possible
    condition the powers of the nation in this vicious order are less at the disposal
    of the sovereign than at the disposal of those who hire to him their agency and
    by consequence sell to him the means of procuring obedience from the nation his
    situation is therefore at bottom a real dependence his situation is precarious
    uncertain changeable he is put in chains which he dares not attempt to break in
    every situation therefore it is the will of the people either of the whole of
    the people united or of a part of the people united against the rest which is
    in reality both the legislative and the executive power estimate therefore as
    high as you please exaggerate to any excess economists the inconvenience of being
    governed by the people you have that inconvenience still you are bound to it by
    the inexorable law of nature  it is not within the range of possibility that you
    should escape from it we have already seen that the economists declare that  every
    man wishes to have all the rights on his own side all the duties on the side of
    other men that every man likes inequality in short when the inequality is in his
    own power from this they infer that the community cannot safely govern  but from
    this it may with much more justness be retorted upon them that nothing else can
    safely govern the interest of the community say the economists is easily known  the
    evidence of it is within the reach of all descriptions of the people and so cogent
    as to be irresistible the union of wills according to their doctrine follows as
    a matter of course here therefore it should seem we have a much better security
    than can be found in the interest of any individual sovereign or subordinate it
    is remarkable enough that the economists have wholly overlooked in their criticism
    on the plans opposed to their own the representative system  and yet it is pretty
    evident that it is by means of the representative system that the grand problem
    of government must finally be resolved the speculations connected with this subject
    will however find a more fitting place under the article government for the exposition
    of the original errors of this sect in political economy it is unnecessary to
    do any thing more than refer to the immortal work of dr adam smith a few years
    ago these errors under something of a new form were revived in this country with
    a success which shows how much the opinions of that great proportion of the community
    whose opinions are not formed upon evidence are liable to change by every fluctuation
    of circumstances from an opinion which had governed this nation for ages that
    to its commerce alone it owed its being the richest nation upon earth our countrymen
    under the momentary threat of circumstances which created an unreasonable fear
    of being deprived of commerce embraced with an avidity hardly conceivable before
    experience the doctrine of mr spence that commerce was no source of riches at
    all what the author of this article thought necessary to be said in opp osition
    to these doctrines at the time he presented in a tract entitled commerce defended
    in answer to mr spence  and an able exposure of the same errors was published

    celebrity  and so peculiarly a benefactor to this publication as would have made
    it fit that some memorial of him should be preserved in these pages even if it
    could have been surmised that it might not have been found in any other place
    there are few names however in tlie recent history of british science that are
    more extensively or advantageously known or of which the few particulars that
    remain to be recorded will be more generally interesting his life like most others
    that have been dedicated to the silent pursuits of learning and science does not
    abound in incidents or adventures but it is full of honour both for the individual
    and the studies to which he was devoted and may be read with more profit than
    many more ambitious histories he was the eldest son of the reverend james playfair
    ministecof benvie in forfarshire in which place he was born on the th of march  he
    resided at home under the domestic tuition of his father till the age of fourteen
    when he entered at the university of st andrews and was almost immediately distinguished
    not merely for his singular proficiency in mathematical learning but for the extent
    of his general knowledge the clearness of his judgment and the dignity and propriety
    of his conduct a remarkable testimony to this effect has been lately made public
    in an early letter of the late principal george hill who was at this time one
    of his fellow students and was himself so remarkable for early talent that we
    find it recorded of him that he had privately composed an excellent sermon in
    the tenth year of his am  a youth of this description cannot be supposed to have
    been very indulgent in his estimate of the merits of his competitors and it could
    therefore have been no ordinary measure of ability that called forth the following
    ingenuous avowal in a confidential letter to his mother   playfair has very great
    merit and more knowledge and a better judgment than any of his class fellows i
    make no exceptions  my parts might be more showy and the kind of reading to which
    my inclination led me was calculated to enable me to make a better figure at st
    andrews but in judgment and understanding i was greatly inferior to him dr cooks
    life of principal hill it is scarcely a stronger though undoubtedly a very different
    proof of his rare attainments that when the professor of natural philosophy wilkie
    the once celebrated author of the epigoniad was prevented by indisposition from
    delivering the regular lectures he used generally to delegate the task of instruction
    to his youthful pupil wilkie besides being a scholar and philosopher of no mean
    note was a man of primitive benevolence and integrity and of great vivacity in
    conversation and the friendship which in spite of the disparity of their yeas
    was speedily formed between him and oung playfair speaks as much for the social
    and moral character of the latter as his substitution of him in the classroom
    does for his early p l a proficiency in science on this last subject we piayir
    shall mention but one fact more in  whenv only eighteen years of age he offered
    himself with the approbation of his instructors at st andrews as candidate for
    the professorship of mathematics in mareschal college aberdeen and sustained with
    the most distinguished credit an examination or comparative trial which lasted
    eleven days and embraced nearly the whole range of the exact sciences out of the
    six competitors who entered the lists against him two only were judged to have
    excelled himthe reverend dr trail who was appointed to the office and dr hamilton
    who afterwards succeeded to and has long filled it with much reputation in  he
    removed to edinburgh where his merit and modesty very soon introduced him to the
    friendship of dr robertsonadam smithdr matthew stewartdr black and dr hutton  with
    all of wnom he continued in terms of the utmost cordiality during the whole period
    of their lives in  he was a candidate for the professorship of natural philosophy
    at st andrews vacant by the death of his friend dr wilkie there was no comparative
    trial on this occasion and he was again unsuccessful under circumstances which
    have led one of the most dutiful sons of that university dr cook in ins life of
    principal hill to remark  how much it suffered in thus losing a man by whose talents
    its reputation would have been so highly promoted in the course of the same year
    the death of his father suddenly devolved upon him the burden of supporting the
    family and admonished him no longer to delay the final election of a profession
    he had been educated with a view to the church and was every way qualified to
    accept a living on the establishment but his decided predilection for science
    had hitherto made him hesitate about engaging in a vocation the duties of which
    he felt if conscientiously discharged would necessarily interfere to a great extent
    with the studies he was lotli to abandon in this emergency however he thought
    himself no longer entitled to indulge in those predilectionsand accordingly made
    appr cation to lord gray the patron for a presentation to the livings of liff
    and benvie which had been filed by his father his lordship was too well awaie
    of his merits to hesitate about conferring so great a benefit on the parishioners
    and immediately issued a presentation in his favour although from some challenge
    of his right to the patronage induction was not obtained till late in the year  from
    this period till  mr playfair was constantly resident at lifl and occupied almost
    exclusively with the pastoral duties of his office in this retreat his leisure
    hours were dedicated to the education of his younger brothers and to a very close
    and intimate correspondence with mr robertson now lord robertson the son of the
    illustrious historian to whom he seems to have confided the remarks that occurred
    to him upon the different authors he perused and the subjects of speculation which
    they suggested  we cannot help hoping that some selection from this correspondence

    the most illustrious name which occurs during this interval as a mathematician

  text: first dissertation  that scotland after a long slumber began again to attract
    general notice in the republic of letters  the writings of dr hutcheson however
    are more closely connected with the history of ethical than of metaphysical science  and
    i shall accordingly delay any remarks which i have to offer upon them till i enter
    upon that part of my subject there are indeed some very original and important
    metaphysical hints scattered over his works but it is chiefly as an ethical writer
    that he is known to the world and that he is entitled to a place among the philosophers
    of the eighteenth century   an italian writer of some note in a work published
    in  assigns the same date to the revival of letters in scotland  fra i tanti e

    somewhat surprised to meet with the foregoing observations in the work of a foreigner
    but wherever he acquired his information it evinces in those from whom it was
    derived a more intimate acquaintance with the traditionary history of letters
    in this country than has fallen to the share of most of our own authors who have
    treated of that subject i have heard it conjectured that the materials of his
    section on scottish literature had been communicated to him by mr hume another
    foreign writer much better qualified than denina to appreciate the merits of hutcheson
    has expressed himself upon this subject with his usual precision  lecole ecossaise

    upon the posthumous works of adam smith annexed by m prevost to his translation
    of that work dr hutchesons first course of lectures at glasgow was given in  he
    was a native of ireland and is accordingly called by denina  un dotto irlandesebut
    he was of scotch extraction his father or grandfather having been a younger son
    of a respectable family in ayrshire and he was sent over when very young to receive
    his education in scotland  one of the chief objects of hutchesons writings was
    to oppose the licentious system of mandeville a system which was the natural offspring
    of some of lockes reasonings against the existence of innate practical principles
    as a moralist hutcheson was a warm admirer of the ancients and seems to have been
    particularly smitten with that favourite doctrine of the socratic school which
    identifies the good with the beautiful hence he was led to follow much too closely
    the example of shaftesbury in considering moral distinctions as founded more on
    sentiment than on reason and to speak vaguely of virtue as a sort of noble enthusiasm  but
    he was led at the same time to connect with his ethical speculations some collateral
    inquiries concerning beauty and harmony in which he pursued with considerable
    success the path recently struck out by addison in his essays on the pleasures
    of the imagination these inquiries of hutcheson together with his thoughts on
    laughter although they may not be very highly prized for their depth bear everywhere
    the marks of an enlarged and cultivated mind and whatever may have been their
    effects elsewhere certainly contridiss i part ii y

    pursuits have since taken both in scotland and in germany will be allowed to form

    foreign writer of great name m frederick schlegel seems to think that the influence
    of mr humes treatise of human nature on the philosophy of england has been still
    more extensive than i had conceived it to be his opinion on this point i transcribe
    as a sort of literary curiosity   since the time of hume nothing more has been
    attempted in england than to erect all sorts of bulwarks against the practical
    influence of his destructive scepticism and to maintain by various substitutes

    central principle of thoughta principle excellent and praiseworthy in its due

    would not one imagine that the writer conceived the wealth of nations to be a
    new moral or metaphysical system devised by mr smith for the purpose of counteracting
    mr humes scepticism  i have read this translation of mr schlegels lectures with
    much curiosity and interest and flatter myself that we shall soon have english
    versions of the works of kant and of other german authors from the pens of their
    english disciples little more i am fully persuaded is necessary in this country
    to bring down the philosophy of germany to its proper level in treating of literary
    and historical subjects mr schlegel seems to be more in his element than when
    he ventures to pronounce on philosophical questions but even in cases of the former
    description some of his dashing judgments on english writers can be accounted
    for only by haste caprice or prejudice  the english themselves we are told are
    now pretty well convinced that robertson is a careless superficial and blundering
    historian although they study his works and are right in doing so as models of
    pure composition extremely deserving of attention during the present declining
    state of english style with all the abundance of his italian elegance what is
    the overloaded and affected roscoe when compared with gibbon  coxe although master
    of a good and classical style resembles robertson in no respect so much as in
    the superficialness of his researches and the statesman fox has nothing in common
    with hume but the bigotry of his party zeal such criticisms may perhaps be applauded
    by a german auditory but in this country they can injure the reputation of none

    to the popular prejudices so industriously fostered by many against these three
    branches of knowledge as ramifications from one common and most pernicious root
    how often have mr smiths reasonings in favour of the freedom of trade been ridiculed
    as metaphysical and visionary nay but a few years have elapsed since this epithet
    accompanied with the still more opprobrious terms of atheistical and democratical
    was applied to the argument then urged against the morality and policy of the
    slavetrade  and in general to every speculation in which any appeal was made to
    the beneficent arrangements of nature or to the progressive improvement of the
    human race absurd as this language was it could not for a moment have obtained
    any currency with the multitude had there not been an obvious connection between
    these liberal doctrines and the well known habits of logical thinking which so
    eminently distinguished their authors and advocates whatever praise therefore
    may be due to the fathers of the modern science of political economy belongs at
    least in part according to the acknowledgment of their most decided adversaries
    to those abstract studies by which they were prepared for an analytical investigation
    of its first and fundamental principles other connections and affinities between
    political economy and the philosophy of the  it furnishes no objection to these
    remarks that some of our best treatises on questions of political economy have
    proceeded from men who were strangers to metaphysical studies it is enough for
    my purpose if it be granted that it was by habits of metaphysical thinking that
    the minds of those authors were formed by whom political economy was first exalted
    to the dignity of a science to a great proportion even of the learned the rules
    of a sound logic are best taught by examples and when a precise and welldefined
    phraseology is once introduced the speculations of the most ordinary writers assume
    an appearance sometimes it must be owned a very fallacious one of depth and consistency
    fontenelle remarks that a single great man is sufficient to accomplish a change
    in the taste of his age and that the perspicuity and method for which descartes
    was indebted to his mathematical researches were successfully copied by many of
    his contempoiaries who were ignorant of mathematics a similar observation will
    be found to apply with still greater force to the models of metaphysical analysis
    and of logical discussion exhibited in the political works of hume and of smith

    j ons o p w  lat cons tituted wealth did not attempt to discover the means by
    which labour might be facilitated he made several valuable additions to particular
    branches of the science and had sufficient acuteness to detect the errors in the
    systems of others  but the task of constructing a better system in their stead
    required talents of a far higher order wealth of at length in  our illustrious
    countryman nations adam smith published the wealth of nationsa work which has
    done for political economy what the principia of newton did for physics and the
    esprit des loix of montesquieu for politics in this work the science was for the
    first time treated in its fullest extent and many of its fundamental principles
    placed beyond the reach of cavil and dispute in opposition to the french economists
    dr smith showed that labour is the only source of wealth and that the desire inherent
    in the breast of every individual to improve his fortune and rise in the world
    is the cause of its accumulation he next traced the means by which the powers
    of labour may be rendered most effective and showed that it is productive of wealth
    when employed in manufactures and commerce as well as when employed in the cultivation
    of the land having established these principles dr smith showed in opposition
    to the commonly received opinions of the merchants politicians and statesmen of
    his time that wealth did not consist in the abundance of gold and silver but in
    the abundance of the various necessaries conveniencies and enjoyments of human
    life he showed that individuals are always the best judges of what is for their
    own interest and that in prosecuting branches of industry advantageous to themselves
    they necessarily prosecute such as are advantageous to the public  from thence
    dr smith drew his grand inference that every regulation intended to force industry
    into particular chan nels or to determine the species of commercial intercourse
    to be carried on between different parts of the same country or between distant
    and independent countries is impolitic and perniciousinjurious to the rights of
    individualsand adverse to the progress of real opulence and lasting prosperity
    the fact that traces of most of these principles and even that the distinct statement
    of many of those that are most important may be found in the works of previous
    writers does not in the least detract from the real merits of dr smith in adopting
    the discoveries ot others he has made them his own  he  has demonstrated the truth
    of principles on which his wealth of predecessors had in most cases stumbled by
    chance  nations has disentangled and separated them from the errors by which they
    were incumbered  has traced their remote consequences and pointed out their limitations  has
    shown their practical importance and real valuetheir mutual dependence and relation
    and has reduced them into a consistent harmonious and magnificent system we do
    not mean to say that dr smith has produced a perfect work undoubtedly there are
    errors and those too of no slight importance in the wealth of nations the principles
    to which we have just referred and which form the basis of the work are unimpeachable  but
    dr smith has not always reasoned correctly from them and he has occasionally introduced
    others which a more careful observation and analysis has shown to be illfounded
    but after every allowance has been made for these defects enough still remains
    to justify us in considering dr smith as the real founder of the science if he
    has not left us a perfect work he has at all events left us one which contains
    a greater mass of useful and universally interesting truths than has ever been
    given to the world by any other individual and he has pointed out and smoothed
    the route by following which subsequent philosophers have been enabled to perfect
    much that he had left incomplete to rectify the mistakes into which he had fallen
    and to make many new and important discoveries whether indeed we refer to the
    soundness of its leading doctrines to the liberality and universal applicability
    of its practical conclusions or to the powerful and beneficial influence it has
    had on the progress and perfection of economical science and still more on the
    policy and destiny of nations dr smiths work must be placed in the foremost rank
    of those that have done most to liberalise enlighten and enrich mankind the practical
    part of the science of political ecodistinction nomy was long confounded with
    that of politics and bete n it is undoubtedly true that they are very intimately
    pj  i and connected and that it is frequently impossible to economy treat those
    questions vhich strictly belong to the one without referring more or less to the
    principles and conclusions of the other but in their leading features they are
    sufficiently distinct the laws which regulate the production and distribution
    of wealth are the same in every country and stage of society those circumstances
    which are favourable or unfavourable to the increase of riches and population
    in a republic may equally exist and will have che faarrichire chi ha intrapresa
    lafabbrica e chi vi simpiega con fehce talentomeditazioni sulla economic polilica    it
    is of importance to observe that dr smith does not say that in prosecuting such
    branches of industry as are most advantageous to themselves individuals necessarily
    prosecute such as are at the same time most advantageous to the public his leaning
    to the system of the economists a leaning perceptible in every part of his workmade
    him so far swerve from the principles of his own system asto admit that individual
    advantage was not always a true test of the public advantageousness of different
    employments he considered agriculture though not the only productive employment
    the most productive of an y a lso considered the home trade as more productive
    than a direct foreign trade and the latter than the carrying trade we shall hereafter

  text: benefit societies  benefit clubmoney besides this is one of the occasions
    societies on w hi c h very extraordinary exertions are made by his acquaintance
    and friends especially if he is not a man thoroughly worthless whose vices not
    his misfortunes are the cause of his distress to supply him with the means and
    this is an exercise of virtue in these acquaintances and friends which is highly
    useful and tends forcibly to the increase of the benevolent feelings in the minds
    both of those who make it and of those in favour of whom it is made it is urged
    as a hardship of great magnitude that a man after he has been a long time a contributor
    to a club should lose the benefit of the whole for a delay in payment at a season
    of peculiar distress but a certain degree of indulgence is allowed a defaulter
    does not forfeit till the first meeting which is a month after the quarterday
    besides it is very common to misrepresent the amount of the loss in this case
    what a man really and truly loses is that which will be necessary to place him
    in the same situation but that is only as much as will be necessary to entitle
    him to the allowances of another club this may be nine or twelve months contributions
    suppose the rate of contribution is s amonth and s of entrymoney what a man loses
    by expulsion however much he may have paid is only s if indeed he is an old man
    past the age of admission into another club what he loses is much more serious
    it is the value of all the benefit which he would have been entitled to derive
    and in this case some modification of the rule of forfeiture would be desirable
    it is however no fundamental objection because such a modification may be easily
    made lastly the number of those who suffer forfeiture from real necessity and
    not from their vices is small bearing a very insignificant proportion to the whole
    for a hardship to the very small number a great benefit to the very great number
    is not to be foregone this is the very principle on which bad government is distinguished
    from good it is brought as a strong argument against benefit clubs that the meetings
    are held at publichouses from this it is inferred that the members are at these
    meetings very commonly seduced to drink and acquire increase or confirm habits
    of intemperance this appears to be an inference altogether unwarranted and contrary
    to the fact the members are in general under the necessity of holding their meetings
    at a publichouse because it is only at a publichouse where they can in general
    hire an apartment for the purpose the use of the apartment is sometimes paid for
    by the money spent which is always a limited and always a very small sum threepence
    most commonly or a pint of porter for each and sometimes the room is paid for
    not in this way but by the contribution of a penny or other small sum from each  and
    intoxication at the time of meeting is punished with a fine it is affirmed by
    those who have most attended to the practical proceedings of these societies that
    instead of being a source of intoxication they have been one of the grand causes
    of its decrease one decided advantage which the benefit clubs possess above the
    savings banks is that the money benefit paid to the club cannot be taken out first
    to gratify societies any unnecessary desire secondly to buy furniture for the
    sake of an early and hence in all probability a fruitful that is a deplorable
    marriage thirdly to satisfy the parish for a bastard which often would not have
    been gotten but for the reflection that if the worst came to the worst means were
    had to get rid of it in a moral point of view the formation of the people into
    little combinations and fraternities is of the greatest importance it concentrates
    the eyes of all upon each individual and renders good conduct a thing of infinitely
    more value to him as it renders bad conduct for men detrimental it is this circumstance
    which the sage mind of dr adam smith loads with such emphatic praise in the supposed
    case of the division of a country into so great a number of religious sects that
    each congregation might be regarded as differing from the rest in this manner
    without difficulty and without care is exercised one of the most vigilant and
    effectual of all censorships the most salutary of all inspections when an ignorant
    or almost any man can say to himself my conduct is regarded by nobodyit is astonishing
    how easy it is for temptation to subdue him  when he must say to himself i cannot
    perform a disgraceful act without reading aversion and contempt in the eyes of
    all my acquaintanceit is astonishing how much he is strengthened for resistance
    there is yet another thing of cardinal importance if it were possible for the
    superior to do everything for the inferior people and to leave them nothing to
    do or care about for themselves nothing would be more calamitous than the accomplishment
    of such an event the mass of thehumanspecies would thence become what the people
    of paraguaj  becamein the hand of the jesuits most perfectly helpless and ready
    on the least derangementin the machinery which conducts them to fail into the
    deepest wretchedness and barbarity as that machinery would be liable to be deranged
    by the slightest accidents it could not be preserved in order long and w r ould
    then serve as an introduction a necessary and certain introduction to one of the
    most deplorable conditions of human affairs the case is altogether different where
    the power of suffering for themselves is generally spread throughout the community  where
    the people have resources  where every man is accustomed to combine for himself
    the means of warding off evil and attaining good there the machine of society
    cannot be easily disordered and human happiness is placed on a much more secure
    foundation then if any of the larger arteries of the body politic is obstructed
    the nourishment of the system is carried on by the admirable service which may
    be rendered by the smaller to a system which has thus a vis medicatrix in all
    its parts no shock can be given that is not immediately repaired were the greatest
    disorder introduced things of their own accord would hasten to their proper place
    it is therefore a prodigious recommendation of benefit societies that in them
    the people act for themselves we do not mention this however as one of the circumstances
    in which they differ from

  text: 'economists economists fulness of happiness hitherto altogether unknown at
    this point therefore we may close the historical part of this article for the
    success of the great work of dr adam smith in a short time superseded the political
    economy of the sect and after the political economy was discredited the rest of
    their doctrines met with little regard the memory of them however is well worthy
    of being preser ved and this task we shall now in as few words as possible endeavour
    to perform ii the economists proceeded upon no utopian plan which supposes society
    to be composed of beings different from those with whom we are already acquainted
    they took man as he isa being having wants and governed by the desire of avoiding
    pain and obtaining pleasure man must have subsistence upon this ground they first
    took their stand this being allowed it followed of course that whatever was the
    best means of obtaining subsistence would command the operations of men as soon
    as ever it was sufficiently known of these means the first and fundamental is
    the establishment of property this they proved by convincing arguments we cannot
    exist without consuming the nature of man leads to a rapid multiplication of human
    beings and the earth yields a spontaneous nourishment for only a few to make food
    keep pace with population labour must be employed upon the ground men would be
    born for no other purpose than that of destroying one another if there were not
    means of increasing the quantity of food in proportion to those that were born
    labour then is one of the physical necessities of nature but if labour be necessary
    so is property because without property there can be no labour the proof of this
    proposition is short and irresistible nobody would labour under an assurance that
    he would derive no advantage from his labour nobody would labour without a certain
    probability that he should enjoy the fruits of his labour now this is property
    the only question then which remains is what is the degree of assurance with respect
    to the fruits of a mans labour  in other words what are the laws of property which
    tend most to secure the benefits which human beings derive from their labour  this
    said the economists is the object and the end of our researches they proceeded
    in their inquiry by the following steps as a means to this labour on which every
    thing depends a man must be free to use his natural faculties of labourhis muscular
    powers this f reedom they called the property of his person as another means to
    the same end he must be free to use exclusively and to preserve what he acquires
    by his labour ibis they called his moveable property   here we see the origin
    of that to which men have assigned the names of rights and duties the exclusive
    powers assigned to the man over his person and ovei the fruits of his labour are
    called his rights io allow these exclusive powers by abstaining from every act
    which would impair them is called the duties of all other men here we see also
    that rights and duties are reciprocal that they imply one aneconomists other that
    they are created together and that the one cannot exist without the other destroy
    the rights of property in the man you destroy by the same act the duties of other
    men to exclude themselves from what was called his property destroy in the same
    manner the duties of other men to exclude themselves from what was called his
    property and you destroy at the same time his right to that exclusion rights and
    duties are in fact but different names given to the same thino according as it
    is regarded under one or another of two points of view another important concatenation
    is here also to be seen rights are advantages  things to be enjoyed duties are
    burthens abstracted from things to be enjoyed why should men accept these burthens
    submit to these duties  why  but because they find their advantage in doing so
    it is plain how they find their advantage in doing so and there is there can be
    no other reason men submit to the duties of respecting other mens rights that
    they may have rights themselves it is good for them to have rights  there can
    be no rights without duties it is better to have the rights submitting to the
    duties than by renouncing the duties to have no rights ihe duties are then the
    price which is paid for the rights the duties which one man yields to other men
    are the price which he pays for having rights of his own duties then are in themselves
    evils  and they never ought to exist except when they are compensated by a greater
    good nobody ought to be subjected to a burthen which is not either to himself
    or to the community in which he has club bed his private interests attended with
    a good sufficiently great to overbalance the evil which he is made to endure utility
    then is the exclusive foundation of duty having laid this foundation the economists
    proceed on the necessity of subsistence rests the necessity of property and on
    the necessity of property rests the necessity of a certain inequality in the conditions
    of men this inequality exists because a good is obtained through it which can
    in no other way be obtained  and that good the parent of every thing else to which
    the name of good is applied  f those who complain of it says mercier de la riviere
    one of the chief expositors of the doctrines of the sect  see not that it is a
    link in the chain by which the human species must drag from the abyss of nonproduction
    every thing which they enjoy as soon as i have acquired the exclusive property
    of a tiling another man cannot have the property of it at the same time ihe jaw
    of property is the same for all men  each man however acquires in proportion to
    his faculties of acquiring  but the measure of these is different in different
    men and besides this fundamental law there is in the whirlpool of accidents a
    continual succession of combinations some more some less fortunate which increase
    the causes of that inequality of acquisition without which the motives to acquisition
    cannot exist   admit however he in conclusion adds  that m any given community

  text: coinage coinage state a few facts by way of vindicating the accuracy of mr
    lockes theory and to point out the real cause why its application to practice
    failed as it is generally acknowledged that it did  the greater portion of the
    silver recoinage having before the year  disappeared from the circulation by an
    abstract account of the prices which the bank of england paid for gold and silver
    bullion in each year from  to  it appears that as early as  they paid l  per oz
    for standard gold and s d for standard silver  and it is probable that the same
    price existed at a more early date after the recoinage though the accounts state
    no price befoie  this account we conceive of very great importance and we think
    will satisfactorily explain why mr lockes theory did not permanently produce the
    effect which the legislature expected from it by a reference to the prices paid
    for gold by the bank of england from  to  it appears that the average price per
    oz was l  s lid during this period the guinea was current for s d at which rate
    the oz of gold was coined into l  s d for if one guinea or  dwts ff g r s be worth
    s d  grs or  oz will be worth l  s fd it would appear then that the market price
    of gold was only d above its mint price  and some debasement by wear may have
    existed upon the gold currency at this period causing such excess of the mint
    price while the mint therefore coined gold at the rate  of l s per oz and silver
    at s d the relative proportion was as  to  there is only one quotation of silver
    given for the period in question and it is s d per oz if we take this as the average
    price for the seven years in question and we may be justified in doing so by the
    market prices which follow in  and subsequent years as extracted from castaigns
    papers and laid before the house of commons and ordered to be printed th march  at
    s per oz the average proportion of gold and silver in the market would be  to  but
    no individual would carry  ozs of silver to the mint to be coined into about l
    s d when these  of silver would procure an ounce of standard gold in the market
    which could be coined into l  s fd making thereby a profit of about l  s d per
    cent while this profit continued it may reasonably be inferred that gold and not
    silver would be the standard of our money it was in september  that sir isaac
    newton delivered in his report to the lords of the treasury giving it as his opinion
    that gold was considerably overrated in the mint with respect to silver and in
    consequence of this report the guinea was by proclamation dated d december  declared
    current at s it is of importance to observe the effect produced upon the price
    of gold by this proclamation  and we are of opinion it will completely prove that
    the silver currency had not operated as the standard of value during the period
    in question when the guinea became a legal tender at s the price of gold became
    fixed at l s d joer oz at the mint for if  dwts f grs be worth s  grs or  oz will
    be worth l s lod this  fall in the price of gold from l s fd is coinage is lojd
    per oz and is equal to about l  per cent it appears by the abstract of prices
    paid for bullion by the bank of england that in  and subsequent years they paid
    l isser oz for standard gold which is a fall from l s fd of is fd per oz and if
    an allowance is made for the debasement by wear existing at this period upon the
    gold coin the fall in the market price of gold will be equal to the reduction
    in the value of the guinea but this effect could not have been produced unless
    gold at the period in question had been the measure of value and as such the measure
    of its own price from these facts we think the conclusion may be justified that
    from  and probably a more early period after the recoinage to the date of sir
    i newtons report the gold money of this country was the standard measure of property  and
    that the reduction of the value of the guinea thereby making the relative proportion
    of gold and silver approximate nearer to those of the market was the first step
    of which we have an authentic record taken by government to maintain the principles
    of mr lockes theory and as the avoved intention of this report was to give that
    rise in value to the silver coin which would protect it from thd melting pot and
    which could be done by lowering that of gold it may be inferred that the legislature
    w t ere aw are that the gold coin had attained the prerogative of being the standard
    of value at this time though the recommendation in sir i newtons report was carried
    into effect by making the guinea current at s yet it did not restore silver to
    its function as the standard of our money and this because the current value was
    not made still lower sir i newton seemed aware of this himself and recommended
    that lod or d should be taken from the guinea instead of d this however was not
    done and as the rate of s to the guinea the proportion of standard gold to standard
    silver at the mint was as  to  the proportion of the market as we find by the
    prices of gold and silver at this period in castaigns papers was about d to   which
    constitutes a difference of about  per cent gold being still thus much rated above
    its value to silver  and consequently not only vas no silver coined but the good
    and heavy coins were still melted for the high price they brought in the state
    of bullion it is surprising that the government having seen the operation of the
    principle recommended in the report of sir i newton did not carry it a little
    further and bring the current value of the guinea to a par with the market proportion
    of the two metals and so render it the interest of the public to carry silver
    to the mint to be coined before concluding our observations upon this highly interesting
    subject we must remark that the great mr locke himself did not impute the high
    price of silver after the recoinage to the cause to which we have here assigned
    it he attributed it to the permission of exporting silver bullion and to the prohibition
    of exporting silver coin this permission he said rendered the demand for silver
    bullion greater than the demand for silver coin dr adam smith remarks upon this
    opinion that the number of

  text: colony  colony tribute to the mother country and that voluntarily because
    the mother country may be of use to it that we may answer is a bargain not a tribute
    the mother country for example may yield a certain portion of defence but the
    colony is saved from the expence of providing for itself that defence which it
    receives from the mother country and makes a good bargain if it gets it from the
    mother country cheaper than it would be provided by itself in this case too the
    expence incurred by the mother country is apt to be a very full equivalent for
    the tribute received it is evident that this sort of bargain may subsist between
    any two states whose circumstances it may suit and is not confined to a mother
    and daughter country it is therefore no part of the question relating to colonies
    hquiry as  we have now investigated the first of the o the admodes in which a
    colony considered as territory antages to me rely may be expected to benefit the
    mother ie got by trade country  and we which it affords lew of dr miths reasonings
    have seen the chances of good we shall now proceed to investigate the second  the
    trade by means of which it is supposed that colonies may benefit the mother country
    this is a topic of some importance  for it is on account of the trade that colonies
    have remained an object of affection to englishmen it is on account of trade solely
    that the colonies in the west indies are valued it is indeed true that some idea
    of something like a tribute from the east indies has till this time maintained
    a place in the minds of the unthinking part of the community but still it is the
    trade which has been supposed to be the principal source of the advantage which
    has been ascribed to what we call  the british empire in the east dr adam smith
    produces a long train of reasoning to prove that it never can be advantageous
    to a country to maintain colonies merely for the sake of their trade in the idea
    of deriving a peculiar advantage from the trade of the colonies is necessarily
    included the idea of monopoly if the trade of the colony were to be free other
    nations would derive as much advantage from it as the mother country  and the
    mdther country would derive as much advantage from it if the colony were not a
    colony dr smith affirms that this monopoly can never be of any advantage  must
    always on the contrary be a source of great disadvantage to the mother country
    he argues thusto make the monopoly advantageous to the mother country it must
    enable the mother country to buy cheaper or sell dearer in the colony than it
    would otherwise have done in ocher words it must enable the mother country to
    obtain the goods of the colony for a smaller quantity of her own goods than she
    could without the monopol this in the opinion of dr smith it does not belong to
    the monopoly to accomplish the monopoly he says may enable the mother country
    to make other nations pay dearer for the goods of the colony but it cannot enable
    her to buy them cheaper this he seems to take as a postulate without attempting
    much to support it by reasoning the extension of the market he says by which he
    must mean the vol iii part i competition of capital would in a state of freedom
    reduce the profits of stock in the colonies to their lowest terms under a monopoly
    he seems to think that profit of stock in the colonies is apt to remain above
    that level and he assumes that the terms on which the mother country deals with
    the colony must depend upon the rate of profits in the colony having on these
    grounds assumed the impossibility of deriving any advantage from the monopoly
    of the colonial trade dr smith proceeds to represent a variety of disadvantages
    which he thinks it has a necessary tendency to produce his argument is that the
    monopoly of the colonial trade necessarily raises the profits of stock in the
    mother country  and that  whatever to use his own expression  raises in any country
    the ordinary rate of profit higher than it otherwise would be necessarily subjects
    that country both to an absolute and to a relative disadvantage in every branch
    of trade of wdiich she has not the monopoly to prove the first of these propositions
    he says that by the monopoly of the trade of any colony foreign capital is driven
    from it the capital of the trade is thus made deficient the profit of the capital
    is for that reason increased the increase of profit in the colony draws capital
    from the mother country the departure of capital from the mother country makes
    the portion of capital in the mother country deficient and hence raises in the
    mother country the profits of stock to prove the second of the propositions he
    says that high profits produce high prices  and that high prices diminish produce
    to afford her merchants the high profits in question the country must pay dearer
    for the goods she imports  and must sell dearer those which she exports she must
    therefore he infers  both buy less and sell less must both enjoy less and produce
    less than she otherwise would do nor is this all other nations who do not subject
    themselves to this disadvantage to this diminution of produce may advance faster
    and thus attain a superiority which they would not otherwise have enjoyed and
    there is still a worse evil  by raising the price of her produce above what it
    would otherwise be it enables the merchants of other countries to undersell her
    in foreign markets and thereby to justle her out of almost all those branches
    of trade of which she has not the monopoly to this reasoning dr smith anticipates
    an objection it may be affirmed that the colony trade is more advantageous than
    any other trade and though it may be true according to the reasonings of smith
    that the monopoly of the colony trade has diminished the amount of trade which
    the mother countrywhich england for example has been able to carry on in other
    channels england has lost nothing because she has exchanged a less profitable
    for a more profitable employment of her capital in answer to this objection dr
    smith endeavours to prove that the employment into which the capital of england
    is forced by the monopoly is less advantageous to the country than that into which
    it would have gone of its own accord as the foundation of his reasoning he assumes
    that  the most l  colony

    fact burke probably alluded when he remarked that  by turning the soul inward
    on itself its forces are concentered and are fitted for stronger and bolder flights
    of science and that in such pursuits whether we take or whether we lose the game
    the chace is certainly of servicethe names of locke of berkeley of hume of quesnai
    of turgot of morellet and above all of adam smith will at once illustrate the
    truth of these observations and show that in combining together in this dissertation
    the sciences of metaphysics of ethics and of politics i have not adopted an arrangement
    altogether capricious  in farther justification of this arrangement i might appeal
    to the popular prejudices so industriously fostered by many against these three
    branches of knowledge as ramifications from one common and most pernicious root
    how often have mr smiths reasonings in favour of the freedom of trade been ridiculed
    as metaphysical and visionary nay but a few years have elapsed since this epithet
    accompanied with the still more opprobrious terms of atheistical and democratical
    was applied to the argument then urged against the morality and policy of the
    slavetrade and in general to every speculation in which any appeal was made to
    the beneficent arrangements of nature or to the progressive improvement of the
    human race absurd as this language was it could not for a moment have obtained
    any currency with the multitude had there not been an obvious connection between
    these liberal doctrines and the well known habits of logical thinking which so
    eminently distinguished their authors and advocates whatever praise therefore
    may be due to the fathers of the modern science of political economy belongs at
    least in part according to the acknowledgment of their most decided adversaries
    to those abstract studies by which they were prepared for an analytical investigation
    of its first and fundamental principles other connections and affinities between
    political economy and the philosophy of the  it furnishes no objection to these
    remarks that some of our best treatises on questions of political economy have
    proceeded from men who were strangers to metaphysical studies it is enough for
    my purpose if it be granted that it was by habits of metaphysical thinking that
    the minds of those authors were formed by whom political economy was first exalted
    to the dignity of a science to a great proportion even of the learned the rules
    of a sound logic are best taught by examples  and when a precise and welldefined
    phraseology is once introduced the speculations of the most ordinary writers assume
    an appearance sometimes it must be owned a very fallacious one of depth and consistency
    b ontenelle remarks that a single great man is sufficient to accomplish a change
    in the taste of his age and that the perspicuity and method for which descartes
    was indebted to his mathematical researches were successfully copied by many of
    his contemporaries who were ignorant of mathematics a similar observation will
    be found to apply with still greater force to the models of metaphysical analysis
    and of logical discussion exhibited in the political works of hume and of smith

  text: 'first dissertation in a private letter of mr humes to one of his most intimate
    friends  some light is thrown on the circumstances which first led his mind into
    this train of sceptical speculation as his narrative has every appearance of the
    most perfect truth and candour and contains several passages which i doubt not
    will be very generally interesting to my readers i shall give it a place together
    with some extracts from the correspondence to which it gave rise in the notes
    at the end of this dissertation every thing connected with the origin and composition
    of a work which has had so powerful an influence on the direction which metaphysical
    pursuits have since taken both in scotland and in germany will be allowed to form
    an important article of philosophical history  and this history i need not offer
    any apology for choosing to communicate to the public rather in mr humes words
    than in my own   sir gilbert elliot bart grandfather of the present earl of minto
    the originals of the letters to which  refer are in lord mintos possession  a
    foreign writer of great name m frederick schlegel seems to think that the influence
    of mr humes treatise of human nature on the philosophy of england has been still
    more extensive than i had conceived it to be his opinion on this point i transcribe
    as a sort of literary curiosity  since the time of hume nothing more has been
    attempted in england than to erect all sorts of bulwarks against the practical
    influence of his destructive scepticism and to maintain by various substitutes
    and aids the pile of moral principle uncorrupted and entire not only with adam
    smith but with all their late philosophers national welfare is the ruling and
    central principle of thoughta principle excellent and praiseworthy in its due
    situation but quite unfitted for beino the centre and oracle of all knowledge
    and science from the connection in which this last sentence stands with the context
    would not one imagine that the writer conceived the wealth of nations to be a
    new moral or metaphysical system devised by mr smith for the purpose of counteracting
    mr humes scepticism  i have read this translation of mr schlegels lectures with
    much curiosity and interest and flatter myself that we shall soon have english
    versions of the works of kant and of other german authors from the pens of their
    english disciples little more i am fully persuaded is necessary in this country
    to bring down the philosophy of germany to its proper level in treating of literary
    and historical subjects mr schlegel seems to be more in his element than when
    he ventures to pronounce on philosophical questions but even in cases of the former
    description some of his dashing judgments on english writers can be accounted
    for only by haste caprice or prejudice  the english themselves we are told are
    now pretty well convinced that robertson is a careless superficial and blundering
    historian although they study his works and are right in doing so as models of
    pure composition extremely deserving of attention during the present declining
    state of english style with all the abundance of his italian elegance what is
    the overloaded and affected roscoe when compared with gibbon  coxe although master
    of a good and classical style resembles robertson in no respect so much as in
    the superficialness of his researches and the statesman fox has nothing in common
    with hume but the bigotry of his party zeal such criticisms may perhaps be applauded
    by a german auditory but in this country they can injure the reputation of none

  text: 'econo m i s t s economists fulness of happiness hitherto altogether unknown
    at this point therefore we may close the historical part of this article for the
    success of the great work of dr adam smith in a short time superseded the political
    economy of the sect and after the political economy was discredited the rest of
    their doctrines met with little regard the memory of them however is well worthy
    of being preserved  and this task we shall now in as few words as possible endeavour
    to perform ii the economists proceeded upon no utopian plan which supposes society
    to be composed of beings different from those with whom we are already acquainted
    they took man as he isa being having wants and governed by the desire of avoiding
    pain and obtaining pleasure man must have subsistence upon this ground they tirst
    took their stand this being allowed it followed of course that whatever was the
    best means of obtaining subsistence would command the operations of men as soon
    as ever it was sufficiently known of these means thefirst and fundamental is the
    establishment of property this they proved by convincing arguments we cannot exist
    without consuming the nature of man leads to a rapid multiplication of human beings
    and the earth yields a spontaneous nourishment for only a few to make food keep
    pace with population labour must be employed upon the ground men would be born
    for no other purpose than that of destroying one another if there were not means
    of increasing the quantity of food in proportion to those that were born labour
    then is one of the physical necessities of nature but if labour be necessary so
    is property because without property there can be no labour the proof of this
    proposition is short and irresistible nobody would labour under an assurance that
    he would derive no advantage from his labour nobody would labour without a certain
    probability that he should enjo the fruits of his labour now this is property
    the only question then which remains is what is the degree of assurance with respect
    to the fruits of a mans labour  in other words what are the laws of property which
    tend most to secure the benefits which human beings derive from their labour  tins
    said the economists is the object and the end of our researches they proceeded
    in their inquiry by the following steps as a means to this labour on which every
    thing depends a man must be free to use his natural faculties of labourhis muscular
    powers this freedom they called the property of his person as another means to
    the same end he must be free to use exclusively and to preserve what he acquires
    by his labour  his they called his moveable property here we see the origin of
    that to which men have assigned the names of rights and duties the exclusive powers
    assigned to the man over his person and over the fruits of his labour are called
    his rights to allow these exclusive powers by abstaining from every act which
    would impair them is called the duties of all other men here we see also that
    rights and duties are reciprocal that they imply one aneconomists other that they
    are created together  and that the v one cannot exist without the other destroy
    the rights of property in the man you destroy by the same act the duties of other
    men to exclude themselves from what was called his property destroy in the same
    manner the duties of other men to exclude themselves from what was called his
    propei ty and you destroy at the same time his right to that exclusion rights
    and duties are in fact but different names given to the same thing according as
    it is regarded under one or another of two points of view another important concatenation
    is here also to be seen rights are advantages  things to be enjoyed duties are
    burthens abstracted from things to be enjoyed why should men accept these burthens
    submit to these duties  why  but because they find their advantage in doing so
    it is plain how they find their advantage in doing so and there is there can be
    no other reason men submit to the duties of respecting other mens rights that
    they may have rights themselves it is good for them to have rights  there can
    be no rights without duties it is better to have the rights submitting to the
    duties than by renouncing the duties to have no rights ihe duties are then the
    price which is paid for the rights the duties which one man yields to other men
    aie the price which he pays for having rights of his ow r n duties then are in
    themselves evils  and they never ought to exist except when they are compensated
    by a greater good nobody ought to be subjected to a burthen which is not either
    to himself  to the community in which he has clubbed his private interests attended
    with a good sufficiently great to overbalance the evil which he is made to endure
    utility then is the exclusive foundation of duty having laid this foundation the
    economists proceed on the necessity of subsistence rests the necessity of property
    and on the necessity of property rests the necessity of a certain inequality in
    the conditions of men i his inequality exists because a good is obtained through
    it which can in no other way be obtained  and that good the parent of every thing
    else to which the name of good is applied f those who complain of it says mercier
    de la riviere one of the chief expositors of the doctrines of the sect  see not
    that it is a link in the chain by which the human species must drag from the abyss
    of nonproduction every thing which they enjoy as soon as i have acquired the exclusive
    property of a thing another man cannot have the property of it at the same time  he
    law of property is the same for all men  each man however acquires in proportion
    to his faculties of acquiring  but the measure of these is different in different
    men and besides this fundamental law there is in the whirlpool of accidents a
    continual succession of combinations some moie some less fortunate which increase
    the causes of that inequality of acquisition without which the motives to acquisition
    cannot exist  l admit however he in conclusion adds  that in any given community

  text: e con  m i s t s  economists concerned there is no balance of opposite forces
    the forces combine instead of opjiosing and so far the balance is lost the loss
    of the balance to this extent may be a loss engrossing the whole of the protection
    to the common interest which it was expected to yield  or it may be a loss not
    extending so far if it goes to the whole extent of that protection there is to
    the purpose in question no balance at all if it does not go to the whole extent
    there will still be some balance more or less what then is the case  the case
    is that the loss goes to the whole and that the balance does not exist the balance
    does not exist as far as the private interests of those who share among them the
    governing powers are concerned but it is only from the private interests of those
    who govern that the nation has any thing to fear it is only against these interests
    that the balance is provided as far however as these private interests are concerned
    the balance does not exist as far therefore as the balance is even supposed to
    be of any service the balance is excluded by the law of nature it follows as a
    corollary that in a country where the people depend upon what is called a balance
    as the whole of their security for good government they have no security at all
    such is the analysis which the economists present of the causes of good and evil
    in human society and of that order of things which best insures the presence of
    the one and the absence of the other tat part of their doctrine which alone is
    yet known to the mere english reader their political economy is introduced as
    only an auxiliary exposition it is part of the developement by which they endeavoured
    to prove the identity which they supposed between the interests of the sovereign
    and the interests of the people but as a very distinct account of this part of
    their system has been given by dr adam smith and has been repeated in a variety
    of publications  and as our object rather was the exhibition of those doctrines
    of the sect which nobody has yet presented to our countrymen in their own language
    we shall content ourselves with only marking the place which their political economy
    held in their general system as the society has public expences it is necessary
    that it also have a public revenue to reconcile the formation of a public revenue
    with the idea of social order it ought to be formed if possible without infringing
    the property of individuals for the sake of which the order of society itself
    is established it ought therefore if possible to be formed without diminishing
    the revenue of individuals when the real origin of revenue the source from which
    it all is drawn is sufficiently understood the mode of forming a revenue for the
    sovereign without diminishing that of individuals would be immediately apparent
    the source of all riches is the land  because the land alone of all the sources
    of production yields a produce greater than the cost of the production the surplus
    produce of the land therefore constitutes a fund which is over and above the remuneration
    to the agents of production and out of which the revenue of the sovereign may
    be taken  without diminishing the motive to production that is without retarding
    the natural progress of the bcohomists state in wealth population and felicity
    to lay the foundation for this plan of a public revenue it was necessary to prove
    that the land is the only source of production  and that manufactures and commerce
    though they alter the form of things never add any thing to the amount or valu
    of production in the developement of these views one of the most remarkable results
    at which the economists arrived was the necessity of perfect freedom to all the
    proceedings which lead to production as giving to produce that form which is most
    agreeable to those w ho are to make use of it till the time of the economists
    the necessity of holding those proceedings in chains and binding them to the will
    of governments w r as the universal doctrine of governments and to a great degree
    of speculators themselves the general principles of the economists respecting
    the freedom of property necessary to constitute the foundation of social order
    led them to infer the evil ot those abridgments of freedom  but they examined
    the inference in detail and showed that the meddling officiousness of governments
    to compel industry to one thing and exclude it from another not only failed to
    effect any good purposes but of necessity created obstructions of the greatest
    magnitude to production in general and tended powerfully to keep down the wealth
    population and prosperity of the state the light which they diffused on this subject
    and which soon produced a grand effect on the minds of men was a good the magnitude
    of which is beyond calculation another of their conclusions is that the revenue
    of the sovereign taken as they said it ought to be wholly from the net produce
    of the land ought to be a fixed and unalterable proportion of that produce the
    reason appeared to them conclusive if the proportion was variable and depended
    upon the will of the owners of the land they might be induced to break upon the
    public revenue and deprive the state of those benefits which the public revenue
    is necessary to produce if it depended upon the sovereign the property of the
    land might be detached from that of its produce  no body would have a motive to
    become a proprietor in land and all the advantages which depend on the existence
    of that property would be lost the production of subsistence would fail and the
    community could not exist this proportion being once fixed there is no longer
    any contrariety between the interest of the sovereign and the interest of any
    portion of his people and the proprietors of land are as completely and securely
    exempt from contributing to the expence of the state as any other class of the
    community the sovereign derives no part of his revenue from the subject and this
    deplorable source of the conflict of interests is wholly cut off the proportion
    being settled for ever between the sovereign and the landowners that alone is
    the property of the landowner which is the proportion remaining to him the rest
    is with regard to him as if it did not exist the sovereign they denominated therefore
    co proprietor of the land and between him and the landowner commonly so called
    a perfect community of interests is fixed it is the interest of the sovereign
    that the produce of the land should in

    either the legislative or the executive powersin a state of ignorance they may
    be led by fraud to lend their powers to their own destruction but it is a part
    also of the doctrine of the economists that in a state of knowledge in which they
    may be easily placed it is not possible they should make any but a good use of
    their power  a nation they said  governed according to the natural and essential
    order of society has necessarily the perfect evidence and knowledge of it and
    therefore sees with certainty that it enjoys its best possible situation this
    perception of necessity unites all the wills and all the forces in the nation
    for the support of that order and by consequence for the creation and preservation
    of all the institutions which are best adapted to that support the people therefore
    may be safely trusted in a nation governed badly governed not according to  the
    natural and essential order but according to what the economists called the  political
    order  it is always they said  one part of the nation which governs the rest the
    weaker which governs the stronger in this case too the power of him who commands
    consists in nothing but the powers united of those who obey him and this union
    of their forces supposes of necessity the union of their wills which can be founded
    only upon the persuasion that this obedience procures them their best possible
    condition the powers of the nation in this vicious order are less at the disposal
    of the sovereign than at the disposal of those who hire to him their agency and
    by consequence sell to him the means of procuring obedience from the nation his
    situation is therefore at bottom a real dependence his situation is precarious
    uncertain changeable he is put in chains which he dares not attempt to break in
    every situation therefore it is the will of the people either of the whole of
    the people united or of a part of the people united against the rest which is
    in reality both the legislative and the executive power estimate therefore as
    high as you please exaggerate to any excess economists the inconvenience of being
    governed by the people you have that inconvenience still you are bound to it by
    the inexorable law of nature  it is not within the range of possibility that you
    should escape from it we have already seen that the economists declare that  every
    man wishes to have all the rights on his own side all the duties on the side of
    other men  that every man likes inequality in short when the inequality is in
    his own power from this they infer that the community cannot safey govern  but
    from this it may with much more justness be retorted upon them that nothing else
    can safely govern the interest of the community say the economists is easily known  the
    evidence of it is within the reach of all descriptions of the people and so cogent
    as to be irresistible the union of wills according to their doctrine follows as
    a matter of course here therefore it should seem we have a much better security
    than can be found in the interest of any individual sovereign or subordinate it
    is remarkable enough that the economists have wholly overlooked in their criticism
    on the plans opposed to their own the representative system  and yet it is pretty
    evident that it is by means of the representative system that the grand problem
    of government must finally be resolved the speculations connected with this subject
    will however find a more fitting place under the article goverxment for the exposition
    of the original errors of this sect in political economy it is unnecessary to
    do any thing more than refer to the immortal work of dr adam smith a few years
    ago these errors under something of a new form were revived in this country with
    a success which shows how much the opinions of that great proportion of the community
    whose opinions are not formed upon evidence are liable to change by every fluctuation
    of circumstances from an opinion which had governed this na rion for ages that
    to its commerce alone it owed its being the richest nation upon earth our countrymen
    under the momentary threat of circumstances which created an unreasonable fear
    of being deprived of commerce embraced with an avidity hardly conceivable before
    experience the doctrine of mr spence that commerce was no source of riches at
    all what the author of this article thought necessary to be said in opposit ion
    to these doctrines at the time he presented in a tract entitled commerce defended
    in answer to mr spence  and an able exposure of the same errors was published
    on the same occasion by major torrens in a pamphlet which he entitled the economists
    refuted f f  the only part of mr mills pamphlet to which it is of any use at present
    particularly to refer is where he proves that a balance necessarily exists between
    production and consumption and that no amount of production can ever be without
    a market a doctrine of cardinal importance first illustrated by m say in bis very
    able work entitled traite deconomic politique but of which the evidence will perhaps
    be found more clearly deduced in this pamphlet than in any other treatise yet

    cleghorn after expressing his regret at having no such influence with the patrons
    as to secure such an arrangement added as mr ferguson sometimes related with much
    emotion  i can only say of you as hamlet did of fontinbras he has my dying voice
    mr ferguson entered on his new duties with a degiee of spirit and activity from
    which the most splendid results were to be anticipated in one particular his mode
    of lecturing was singular and not easily imitated after having delineated the
    general plan of his course and committed it to writing he resolved not to write
    a system of lectures but to endeavour to make himself master of every part of
    his subject and to trust to the moment of delivery for the expression of his sentiments
    this method of discoursing was in his hands very happily executed  but its success
    depended in a great measure on the state of his health and spirits as well as
    upon the interest excited by the different subjects of discussion perhaps no lecturer
    with the exception of his immediate successor was ever more admired his class
    was crowded by great numbers of gentlemen of high rank and official station as
    well as by younger students in the mean time eagerly as he applied to the discharge
    of his professional duties his attention was extended to bther branches of inquiry  and
    within little more than a year after he commenced his labours as a lecturer on
    m j   ls   he sent to the p r ess his essay on the history of livil society  a
    work which was received with an expression of public applause which even exceeded
    the high expectations of his friends  fergusons book says mr hume writing to dr
    robertson from london goes on here with great success gray the poet says  there
    are uncommon strains of eloquence in it and i was surprised to find not one singleidiom
    of his country i think in the whole work mr hume in a letter to the author dated
    th march  congratulates him on the success ot the book adding that he had  met
    with nobody mat had read it who did not praise it lord mansfield is very loud
    to that purpose in his sunday so cieties i heard lord chesterfield and lord lyttleton
    express the same sentiment and what is above all caddel lam told is already projecting
    a second edi tion of the same quarto size mr hume then informs mm that lord shelburne
    and lord bute were among his most zealous partizans the last declaring the book
    one of the best he ever read charles townshend appears to have been of the same
    opinion as he read it five times over general clerk had pressed the author to
    dedicate his work to lord shelburne who had signified his intenticm of offering
    mr ferguson the government of est florida upon which occasion his lordship aughed
    very heartily when the general expressed his conviction that mr ferguson was more
    usefully emp oed as a teacher of science the book however appeared without any
    dedication in the course of the ollowing year lord shelburne intimated a hope
    of getting mr ferguson established with a proper appointment at oxford and some
    other persons of influence meditated a design of employing him in one  the departments
    of state this purpose was frusvol ly jart j fee trated in all probability by a
    temper which did not permit him to accommodate himself to the views ot those whose
    maxims of conduct he did not entirely approve another circumstance may be considered
    as having also operated to obstruct the fulfilment of the schemes which were devised
    for his advancement at this time he married miss burnet a young lady nearly connected
    with his mothers fan t l st   ra  re nea  r ty related to his intimate mend dr
    black soon aiterwards he began to cultivate a farm in the parish of currie and
    at a considerable sacrifice of private interest gratified his taste tor improvement
    by transforming a barren heath into fertility whlch became distin g uished beauty
    and it was impossible however for any combination of circumstances to abate his
    literary activity and he not only continued to conduct the business of his class
    with unremitted diligence but seized every interval of leisure which he could
    command to collect materials for a history of the roman commonwealth while he
    was proceeding in his researches he was solicited by philip earl of stanhope the
    editor of dr robert simsons posthumous works and the other guardians of charles
    earl of chesterfield to superintend the education of that young nobleman then
    in his nineteenth year the negociation was conducted through the mediation of
    dr adam smith who judging the offer to be advantageous to his friend exerted himself
    with great earnestness to induce him to accept it lord stanhope was extiemely
    anxious to obtain the able services of dr ferguson without delay as he conceived
    it to be of the utmost consequence to his young kinsman to be placed under the
    care of  a person so well qualified to complete the remaining part of his education
    and to repair the neglects omissions and errors which had unfortunately been committed
    in the former part of iu  the proposal had originally been made early in the year  and
    was renewed in december soon after the commencement of the session of the college
    when dr ferguson was engaged not only in teaching his own class but also in lecturing
    on natural philosophy the professorship of which had recently become vacant by
    the death of his relation mr russell he was not able to prevail on the patrons
    to accept of a substitute to complete the labours of that session but after obtaining
    leave of absence for the next session he joined his young charge at geneva in
    may  and at first entertained hopes that his labours might prove beneficial the
    connection however was not so agreeable as he expected and it terminated about
    twelve months afterwards in the mean time he had very nearly been deprived of
    his office in the university the towncouncil had at his desire appointed mr john
    bruce then assist ant and afterwards successor to mr stevenson to teach the ini
    oral philosophy during the session  and  but before the conclusion of the session
    they thought fit to rescind this act and to declare the office vacant his friends
    in the university particu larly drs robertson blair and black were exceedingly
    indignant at this proceeding more especially as sir john pringle had been permitted
    to be several years absent and at that very time the professors of mathematics

    his time between his literary and agricultural pursuits and engaged occasionally
    in the political controversies which agitated the country during the progress
    of the american war besides his pamphlet in answer to dr prices observations on
    liberty he communicated his views from time to time to sir william pulteney and
    other members of parliament and when it was resolved by government to send out
    commissioners to quiet the disorders in the colonies he was appointed secretary
    to the commission it appears from a letter of general putnam dated july  that
    the nomination of dr ferguson was very agreeable to the more intelligent part
    of the americans who not without reason were dissatisfied to find that the commissioners
    were fettered by restrictions which rendered their appointment nugatory  i am
    very sorry he writes that the parliament of great britain is still so blind to
    their own and our interest as to send dr ferguson and the rest of the worthy gentlemen
    over to america with limited power and that to last only till july l and then
    to be revoked by them if they think fit by which means i am deprived of seeing
    your friend dr ferguson which gives me great pain as i always have heard of his
    being a gentleman of the first character for learning good sense and humanity
    it is well known that the commissioners returned without accomplishing the object
    of their mission  but they had an opportunity of acquiring more useful information
    of the state and temper of the country than government had received in all the
    previous course of the contest while dr ferguson was absent during the session   his
    place was supplied by mr dugald stewart who about five years afterwards was destined
    to succeed him in the chair of moral philosophy in the year  so he was seized
    with an attack of apoplexy which though not violent was sufficient to alarm his
    friends for his safety this formidable affection did not in the slightest degree
    impair the force of his understanding and so abstemious did he afterwards become
    as not only to secure himself against the recurrence of the disease but to enjoy
    almost uninterrupted health for more than thirty years as he could not now venture
    to lecture as formerly without the use of written notes he therefore found it
    necessary to write out a course of instruction to be read during the remainder
    of his incumbency in his endeavours to recover the substance of his lectuiesj
    he availed himself of the notes taken by intelligent young men who had studied
    under him different fergussessions and who thus might be expected to have preserved
    the various modes in which he had stated his doctrines and the different arguments
    and illustrations by which he had happened to supply in one session what might
    have been omittedin another but in the prospect of soon relinquishing his office
    it was scarcely conceivable that the compilation which he thus executed could
    possess all the excellencies which he was capable of imparting to it more especially
    as he was now busy in carrying his great historical work through the press this
    was the history of the progress and termination of the roman republic in three
    volumes quarto published in  a book which not only delights by the clearness of
    its narrative and the boldness of its descriptions but instructs and animates
    by profound and masterly delineations of character as well as by the philosophical
    precision wth which it traces the connection of events it is written in that tone
    of highminded enthusiasm which if it can only snatch from oblivion whatever is
    noble and generous in the record of human actions regards the graces of style
    as objects merely of secondary account and is chiefly studious of impressing the
    lessons  of wisdom which may be gathered from the survey of distant ages the fatigues
    and anxieties of public teaching now became oppressive to his spirits and not
    altogether favourable to his health  and he therefore deemed it expedient to resign
    his office in  wheu he had com pleted his sixtyfirst year mr dugald stewart then
    professor of mathematics succeeded to his office and in order to entitle dr ferguson
    to retain his salary he was conjoined in the professorship of mathematics with
    the late lamented mr playfair he now proceeded to revise the notes of his lectures
    on ethics and politics with a view to publication and in  the work appeared under
    the title of principles of moral and political science though composed under disadvantageous
    circumstances and though it has omitted many of the questions which were treated
    in his elementary course it contains an admirable view of the systems both of
    ancient and modern philosophers particularly on the foundations of moral approbation
    and the sources of private happiness and public security the authors to whose
    suggestions he was most indebted were xenophon plato and aristotle among the greeks
    cicero and seneca among the latins lpictetus and antoninus among the later scholars
    of the grecian school and among the moderns shaftesbury hutcheson montesquieu
    and adam smith it has been considered as a blamtable omission in this work that
    too slight notice is taken of the importance of religious principle and the author
    seems to have been aware that he had exposed himself to this objection no man
    however was ever more anxious to establish the foundations of natural theology
    and to strengthen the arguments for a future state on which subjects the work
    abounds in passages of uncommon beauty after the publication of this work dr ferguson

  text: demand thould be created to take off the jupply fisheries eras paddington
    and the wliole line of london along the new road containing an immense population
    almost entirely cut offfrom the use offish the only arguments in favour of keeping
    back the fish and throwing them overboard is the frequent westerly wind which
    prevents the fishingvessels from proceeding to the market up the thames but that
    excuse is now done away by the numerous steamvessels which could easily tow up
    the fishingboats the supply as we have stated is inexhaustible and the means are
    within our reach of availing ourselves to any extent of that supply  but the demand
    appears obviously to be neither so steady and certain nor so extensive as it might
    and ought to be  and hence the real cause of the failure of all the plans for
    extending the fisheries when the catch was abundant the fishermen had no home
    market to take the fish off their hands and a bad season impoverished the funds
    of those who had embarked on a larger scale for the foreign market the promoters
    dissatisfied withheld their contributions and the fishermen dispirited and without
    capital directed their industry into another channel and too frequently from their
    knowledge gained of the opposite coast and new connections formed there into a
    channel destructive to their morals and injurious to the revenue observations
    the encouragement given by the government in  thebounthe shape of bounties was
    riot sufficient to counteract the evils that have been stated and appears to have
    contributed but little to the success of the fisheries if a branch of trade once
    fairly established will not support itself without being bolstered up by bounties
    it never can be worth carrying on bounties should only be continued for a definite
    time arid decreased gradually those on the fisheries should be given on the quantity
    procured and the quality of those cured and not on the instrument of their productionon
    the fish and not on the vessel it was proved by a committee of the house of commons
    in  that the herringfishery absolutely cost little short of l annually which on
    an average of ten years was equal to l per cent on the value of all the fish that
    had been taken by the vessels on which it was paid adam smith has justly observed
    that a tonnage bounty proportioned to the burden of the ship and not to her diligence
    and success in the fishery is not the best stimulus to exertion  it was an encouragement
    for fitting out ships to catch not the fish but the bounty or to induce rash adventurers
    to engage in concerns which they do not understand and cause them to lose by their
    ignorance more than is gained by the liberality of government the carelessness
    of such persons and the ignorance of those employed by them in curing and packing
    the fish not only robbed the public purse but destroyed the character of the article
    in the foreign market where if saleable at all it fetched only an inferior price
    wdiile the skill and attention of the dutch secured for their fish that preference
    to which they were justly entitled the change of the bounty however from the tonnage
    to the quantity and the quality of the fish caught and cured with the regulations
    adopted by the acts of fisheries th and th geo ill   have had ihe good effect
    of fisheries raising the character and consequently increasing t e demand for
    british fish in the foreign markets where the herrings in particular are now held
    in equal esteem with those of the dutch this bounty granted by the act th geo
    iii c  is s per bairel on all herrings branded by the proper officer and s a barrel
    granted by the act th geo iii c  and is so considerable tat at this time it amounts
    to a sum not less than l ayear nothing can more strongly exemplify the good effects
    arising from the measure of shifting the bounty from the tonnage to the actual

    the year ending th april   an account of the total number of vessels including
    their repeated voyages which have been cleared outwards for the british herringfishery

    the relief of the manufacturing poor proves decisively how easy it would be to
    introduce the general use of fish in the metropolis he agreed with some fishermen
    to take from ten to twenty thousand mackerel a day at a price not exceeding s
    the hundred of six score or at a penny apiece a price at which the fishermen said

    upon them till i enter upon that part of my subject there are indeed some very
    original and important metaphysical hints scattered over his works but it is chiefly
    as an ethical writer that he is known to the world and that he is entitled to
    a place among the philosophers of the eighteenth century  among the contemporaries
    of dr hutcheson there was one scottish metaphysician andrew baxter author of the
    inquiry into the nature of the human soul whose name it would be improper to pass
    over without some notice after the splendid eulogy bestowed on his work by warburton  he
    who would see the justest and precisest notions of god and the soul may read this
    book one of the most finished of the kind in my humble opinion that the present
    times greatly advanced in true philosophy have produced  to this unqualified praise
    i must confess i do not think baxters inquiry altogether entitled although i readily
    acknowledge that it displays considerable ingenuity as well as learning some of
    the remarks on berkeleys argument against the existence of matter are acute and
    just and at the time when they were published had the merit of novelty one of
    his distinguishing doctrines is that the deity is the immediate agent in producing
    the phenomena of the material world  but that in the moral world the case is differenta
    doctrine which whatever may be thought of it in other respects is undoubtedly
    a great improvement on that of malebranche which by representing god as the only
    agent in the universe was not less inconsistent than the scheme of spinoza with
    the moral nature of man  the deity says baxter is not only at the head of nature
    but in every part of it a chain of material causes betwixt the deity and the effect
    produced and much more a series of them is such a supposition as would conceal
    the deity from the knowledge of mortals for ever we might search for matter above
    matter till we were lost in a labyrinth out of which no philosopher ever yet found
    his waythis way of bringing in second causes is borrowed from the government of
    the moral world where free agents act a part but it is very improperly apche sia

    of hutchesons writings was to oppose the licentious system of mancevi e a sys

    of innate practical principles as a moralist hutcheson was a warm admirer of the
    ancients and seems to have been particularly smitten with that favourite doctrine
    of the socratic school which identifies the good with the beautiful hence he was
    led to fo ow much too closely the example of shaftesbury in considering moral
    distinctions as founded more on sentiment t an on reason and to speak vaguely
    of virtue as a sort of noble enthusiasm  but he was led at the same time to connect
    with his ethical speculations some collateral inquiries concerning beauty and
    harmony in which he pursued with considerable success the path recently struck

    the argument which infers the existence of an intelligent cause from the order
    of the universe there cannot however be a doubt that he was aware at this period
    of his life of the conclusions to which it unavoidably leads and which are indeed
    too obvious to escape the notice of a far less acute inquirer in a private letter
    of mr humes to one of his most intimate friends  some light is thrown on the circumstances
    which first led his mind into this train of sceptical speculation as his narrative
    has every appearance of the most perfect truth and candour and contains several
    passages which i doubt not will be very generally interesting to my readers i
    shall give it a place together with some extracts from the correspondence to which
    it gave rise in the notes at the end of this dissertation every thing connected
    with the origin and composition of a work which has had so powerful an influence
    on the direction which metaphysical pursuits have since taken both in scotland  and
    in germany will be allowed to form an important article of philosophical history
    and this history i need not offer any apology for choosing to communicate to the
    public rather in mr humes words than in my own  from the reply to this letter
    by mr humes very ingenious and accomplished correspondent we learn that he had
    drawn from mr humes metaphysical discussions the only sound and philosophical
    inference that the lameness of the proofs offered by descartes and his successors
    of some fundamental truths universally  sir gilbert elliot bart grandfather of
    the present earl of minto the originals of the letters to which i refer are in

    seems to think that the influence of mr humes treatise of human nature on the
    philosophy of england has been still more extensive than i had conceived it to
    be his opinion on this point i transcribe as a sort of literary curiosity   since
    the time of hume nothing more has been attempted in england than to erect all
    sorts of bulwarks against tne practical influence of his destructive scepticism
    and to maintain by various substitutes and aids the pile of moral pnnciple uncorrupted

    praiseworthy in its due situation lut quite unfitted for being the centre and
    oracle of all knowledge and science from the connection in which this last sentence
    stands with the context would not one imagine that the writer conceived the wealth
    of nations to be a new moral or metaphysical system devised by mr bmitii tor the
    purpose of counteracting mr humes scepticism    i i have read this translation
    of mr schlegels lectures with much curiosity and interest and flatter mysell that
    we snau soon have english versions of the works of kant and of other german authors
    from the pens of their english disciples little more i am fully persuaded is necessary
    in this country to bring down the philosophy of germany to its proper level in
    treating of literary and historical subjects mr schlegel seems to be more in his
    element than when he ventures to pronounce on philosophical questions but even
    in cases of the former description some of his dashing judgments on english writers
    can be accounted for only by haste caprice or prejudice  the english themselves
    we are told are no pretty well convinced that robertson is a careless superficial
    and blundering historian although they study his nor  and are right in doing so

  text: preliminary dissertations early habits of abstract meditation to this fact
    burke probably alluded when he remarked that s by turning the soul inward on itself
    its forces are concentered and are fitted for stronger and bolder flights of science
    and that in such pursuits whether we take or whether we lose the game the chase
    is certainly of service the names of locke of berkeley of hume of quesnai of turgot
    of morellet and above all of adam smith will at once illustrate the truth of these
    observations and show that in combining together in this dissertation the sciences
    of metaphysics of ethics and of politics i have not adopted an arrangement altogether
    capricious  in farther justification of this arrangement i might appeal to the
    popular prejudices so industriously fostered by many against these three branches
    of knowledge as ramifications from one common and most pernicious root how often
    have mr smiths reasonings in favour of the freedom of trade been ridiculed as
    metaphysical and visionary  nay but a few years have elapsed since this epithet
    accompanied with the still more opprobrious terms of atheistical and democratical
    was applied to the argument then urged against the morality and policy of the
    slavetrade and in general to every speculation in which any appeal was made to
    the beneficent arrangements of nature or to the progressive improvement of the
    human race absurd as this language was it could not for a moment have obtained
    any currency with the multitude had there not been an obvious connection between
    these liberal doctrines and the well known habits of logical thinking which so
    eminently distinguished their authors and advocates whatever praise therefore
    may be due to the fathers of the modern science of political economy belongs at
    least in part according to the acknowledgment of their most decided adversaries
    to those abstract studies by which they were prepared for an analytical investigation
    of its first and fundamental principles other connections and affinities between
    political economy and the philosophy of the human mind will present themselves
    afterwards at present i purposely confine myself to that which is most obvious
    and indisputable the influence of metaphysical studies may be also perceived in
    the philosophical spirit so largely infused into the best historical compositions
    of the last century this spirit has indeed been often perverted to pernicious
    purposes but who can doubt that on the whole both history and philosophy have
    gained infinitely by the alliance  how far a similar alliance has been advantageous
    to our poetry may be more reasonably questioned but on the most unfavourable supposition
    it must be admitted that the number of poetical readers has thereby been greatly
    increased and the pleasures of imagination proportionally communicated to a wider
    circle the same remark may be extended to the study of philosophical criticism
    if it has not contributed to the encouragement of original genius in the fine
    arts it has been followed by a much more beneficial result in diffusing a relish
    for the beautiful and the elegant not to mention its influence in correcting and
    fixing the public taste by the precision and steadiness of the principles to which
    it appeals  another instance still more important of the practical influence of
    metaphysical science is the improvement wliich since the time of locke has become
    general in the conduct of education  it furnishes no objection to these remarks
    that some of our best treatises on questions of political economy have proceeded
    from men who were strangers to metaphysical studies it is enough for my purpose
    if it be granted that it was by habits of metaphysical thinking that the minds
    of those authors were formed by whom political economy was first exalted to the
    dignity of a science to a great proportion even of the learned the rules of a
    sound logic are best taught by examples  and when a precise and welldefined phraseology
    is once introduced the speculations of the most ordinary writers assume an appearance
    sometimes it must be owned a very fallacious one of depth and consistency fontenelle
    remarks that a single great man is sufficient to accomplish a change in the taste
    of his age and that the perspicuity and method for which descartes was indebted
    to his mathematical researches were successfully copied by many of his contemporaries
    who were ignorant of mathematics a similar observation will be found to apply
    with still greater force to the models of metaphysical analvsis and of logical
    discussion exhibited in the political works of hume arid of smith  s see some
    admirable remarks on this subject by gray in his comments on the lo of plato edition

    class in question it implied only that conscience was a separate element in our
    nature and that it was not a state or act of the understanding according to him
    it also implied that it was an original and implanted principle but every other
    part of his theory might be embraced by those who hold it to be derivative the
    object of moral approbation according to him is general benevolence  and he carries
    this generous error so far as to deny that prudence as long as it regards ourselves
    can be morally approvedan assertion contradicted by every mans feelings and to
    which we owe the dissertation on the nature of virtue which butler annexed to
    his analogy by proving that all virtuous actions produce general good he fancied
    that he had proved the necessity of regarding the general good in every act of
    virtue an instance of that confusion of the theory of moral sentiments with the
    criterion of moral actions against which the reader was warned at the opening
    of this dissertation as fatal to ethical philosophy he is chargeable like butler
    with a vicious circle in describing virtuous acts as those which are approved
    by the moral sense while he at the same time describes the moral sense as the
    faculty which perceives and feels the morality of actions he was the father of
    speculative philosophy in scotland at least in modern times for though in the
    beginning of the sixteenth century the scotch are said to have been known throughout
    europe by their unmeasured passion for dialectical subtilties  and though this

    yet it languished with every other intellectual taste and talent from the restoration

    liberty religion virtue and human happiness  that he taught in public with persuasive
    eloquence that his instructive conversation was at once lively and modest that
    he united pure manners with a kind disposition what wonder that such a man should
    have spread the love of knowledge and virtue around him and should have rekindled
    in his adopted country a relish for the sciences which he cultivated  to him may
    also be ascribed that proneness to multiply ultimate and original principles in
    human nature which characterized the scottish school till the second extinction
    of a passion for metaphysical speculation in scotland a careful perusal of the

    ensmiths theory of moral sentiments adam smith  the great name of adam smith rests
    upon the enquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations  perhaps
    the only book which produced an immediate general and irrevocable change in some
    of the most important parts of the legislation of all civilized states the works
    of grotius of locke and of montesquieu which bear a resemblance to it in character
    and had no inconsiderable analogy to it in the extent of their popular influence
    were productive only of a general amendment not so conspicuous in particular instances
    as discoverable after a time in the improved condition of human affairs  the work
    of smith as it touched those matters which may he numbered and measured and weighed
    bore more visible and palpable fruit in a few years it began to alter laws and
    treaties and has made its way throughout the convulsions of revolution and conquest
    to a due ascendant over the minds of men with far less than the average obstructions
    of prejudice and clamour which choakthe channels through which truth flows into
    practice the most eminent of those who have since cultivated and improved the
    science will be the foremost to address their immortal master tenebris tantis

    lib iii in a science more difficult because both ascending to more simple general
    principles and running down through more minute applications though the success
    of smith has been less complete his genius is not less conspicuous perhaps there
    is no ethical work since ciceros offices of which an abridgement enables the reader
    so inadequately to estimate the merit as the theory of moral sentiments this is
    not chiefly owing to the beauty of diction as in the case of cicero  but to the
    variety of explanations of life and manners which embellish the book often more
    than they illuminate the theory yet on the other hand it must be owned that for
    purely philosophical purposes few books more need abridgement for the most careful
    reader frequently loses sight of principles buried under illustrations the naturally
    copious and flowing style of the author is generally redundant and the repetition
    of certain formularies of the system is in the later editions so frequent as to
    be wearisome and sometimes ludicrous perhaps smith and hobbes may be considered
    as forming the two extremes of good style in our philosophy the first of graceful
    fulness falling into flaccidity while the masterly concision of the second is
    oftener tainted by dictatorial dryness hume and berkeley though they are nearer
    the extreme of abundance  are probably the least distant from perfection that
    mankind are so constituted as to sympathize with each others feelings and to feel
    pleasure in the accordance of these feelings are the only facts required by dr
    smith and they certainly must be granted to him to adopt the feelings of another
    is to approve them when the sentiments of another are such as would be excited
    in us by the same objects we approve them as morally proper to obtain this accord
    it becomes necessary for him who enjoys or suffers to lower his expression of
    feeling to the point to which the bystander can raise his fellowfeelings  on which
    are founded all the high virtues of selfdenial and selfcommand and it is equally
    necessary for the bystander to raise his sympathy as near as he can to the level
    of the original feeling in all unsocial passions such as anger we have a divided
    sympathy between him who feels them and those who are the  born in   died in   notes

  text: leslie lc c could be urged to the young philosopher who unhesisirtin tatingly
    declared that he never would bestow half that  time upon any language and that
    he particularly disliked m latin in this state of his knowledge and taste he was
    in his thirteenth year sent to the university of st andrews to study mathematics
    under professor vilant on examination by the professor he was found already qualified
    for the second or senior class  and at the close of the session he obtained a
    prize it is remembered as a characteristic particular that having previously discovered
    in some of those antiquarian researches to which also he was early addicted that
    it was not indispensable for students of the first year to wear a gown he steadily
    refused during this year to exhibit himself in the accustomed academical habiliment
    this session proved a decisive one as to the course of his future studies the
    earl of kinnoull then chancellor of the university having been informed of his
    remarkable abilities sent for his father and proposed to him to defray the expense
    of his sons education provided the father would agree to maintain him at college
    with the view of qualifying him for the church the proposal was readily embraced
    and the repugnance of theyouth toapply himself to latin was at length overcome
    by making the permission to attend the natural philosophy class of next sessionthe
    great object of his desireconditional on his agreeing to qualify himself during
    the vacation for attending also the latin class with this lure before him he applied
    assiduously to his lessons under the direction of a private teacher and succeeded
    in fitting himself for admission into that class no one could discover in his
    after life any traces of this early and vehement dislike to latin  for though
    he ever held that the learned languages were suffered to engross too much attention
    in our system of education and was by no means sparing of reprehension upon this
    subject  his own scholarship had become considerable  and indeed his writings
    manifest a more than ordinary degree of fondness for embellishing the conclusions
    of science with illustrations from the greek and latin classics he continued to
    the last to read them occasionally particularly lucretius whose bold and imaginative
    philosophy and splendid descriptions were peculiarly adapted to his taste he came
    also to be well versed in the theory of grammar and his observations upon languages
    often evinced learning as well as ingenuity his health at the period above alluded
    to was still so delicate that it became necessary to moderate and regulate his
    studious habits  but he succeeded during his second session in acquiring additional
    honours and in attracting in a more marked degree the flattering attentions of
    the chancellor who kindly invited him to dupplin castle where notwithstanding
    the bashfulness of his manner he contrived to impress the other visitors with
    a high opinion of his powers about the same time he became known to mr playfair
    on occasion of a visit which the latter alongst with the reverend dr small made
    to st andrews dr smalls son was a fellowstudent and companion of young leslie
    and hence his introduction to both these mathematicians mr playfair was at this
    time parish minister of liff in forfarshire here he was afterwards visited by
    his young acquaintance neither of them then dreaming of that lot which was to
    place them in succession in two conspicuous chairs of the university of edinburgh
    destined to derive from both additional lustre and  recommendations his visits
    to mr playfair were continuleslie ed after the latter in  resigned his clerical
    charge in sir joim order to superintend the education of the present robert v
    ferguson esq of raith and his brother sir ronald it was in this way we believe
    that he first became known to these excellent and distinguished men then youths
    of his own age  and the acquaintance in after years ripened into a warm and lasting
    friendship alike honourable to both parties and which formed one of the chief
    and most valued solaces of his life in  or  he quitted st andrews and proceeded
    to edinburgh with the intention of entering himself a studentof divinity in the
    metropolitan university he was accompanied by a fellowstudent destined like himself
    to obtain a distinguished niche in the temple of science james ivory and they
    lived together for some time he never had any liking for the church as a profession  and
    though he was formally entered at the divinity hall he contrived to devote his
    first session to the sciences particularly to chemistry in fact he seems early
    to have relinquished all thoughts of the church a resolution perhaps hastened
    by the death of his patron the earl of kinnoull which took place soon after his
    removal to edinburgh he continued to study here till the close of the session
    of  and as is customary with students of greater ability and industry than means
    devoted part of his time to private tuition one of the young men whose studies
    he assisted was nearly related to and became the heir of dr adam smith  a circumstance
    which he was accustomed to recollect with pleasure as having made him known to
    that illustrious philosopher who treated him kindly and occasionally favoured
    him with directions as to his own pursuits his first essay as an author must have
    been composed about the time of h is leaving this university it was a paper i
    the resolution of indeterminate problems which was read to the royal society of
    edinburgh by mr playfair in  and published in their transactions in this year
    he was prevailed upon by two young students of the name of randolph and of the
    distinguished american family of that name to accompany them in capacity of tutor
    to virginia and he accordingly left scotland alongst with them they arrived at
    the place of their destination in the beginning of november and his time afterwards
    seems to have passed both agreeably and usefully he was all his life fond of visiting
    other countries and pei haps a little disposed to underrate his own thus he was
    wont to say that the thunderstorms of virginia took away all feelings of awe at
    those of scotland just as the alps of switzerland left him nothing to admire in
    the scottish mountains his stay in the new world did not much exceed a year owing
    to the breaking up of the family establishment by the death of the father of his
    young friends after visiting new york and philadelphia he returned to his native
    place towards the close of the year  from some letters to his family written about
    the time of his leaving america his thoughts seem to have been anxiously directed
    to his future means of employment and support and one of his schemes appears to
    have been to try his fortune in india probably as a civil engineer this notion
    recurred afterwards but without leading to any results his next field of adventure
    was london whither he proceeded in january  carrying with him various letters
    of recommendation one of which was written by dr   the c the precious ixmcnu of

  text: l e s leslie adam smith then drawing near the close of his career it sir john
    was on thig occasion if our recollection does not mislead us that dr smith exhorted
    his young friend never to approach any author whose favour he might wish to win
    without first reading his book lest the conversation should happen to turn that
    way one of mr leslies objects in visiting the capital was to ascertain what success
    he might expect from a course of lectures on natural philosophy  and the information
    he received soon satisfied him as he says in a letter to one of his brothers that  rational
    lectures would not succeed he therefore employed himself for some time in writing
    for the monthly review and in executing literary jobs delegated to him by his
    countryman dr william thomson author of the continuation of watsons history of
    philip the third and of many other works now forgotten and who was much in the
    habit of lending his versatile pen as well as his name to those who required the
    assistance or recommendation of either but a more eligible and suitable connection
    was ere long opened to him by the invitation of the younger wedgewoods who had
    been his fellowstudents at edinburgh to reside with them and superintend their
    studies he readily acceded to their proposals and proceeded in april  to their
    residence at etruria in staffordshire where he remained till the close of  in
    the enjoyment of a liberal salary and of society at once agreeable and intelligent
    this was in every sense a happy and profitable period of his life the time not
    devoted to tuition was assiduously employed in experimental investigations and
    in completing a translation of buffons natural history of hirds which he had previously
    undertaken for a london bookseller it was published in  after he left etruria
    in nine volumes octavo though executed with fidelity and vigour it was valued
    by himself at least after he became otherwise eminent only as having by the sum
    which it procured him laid the foundation of that pecuniary competency which he
    early foresaw to be necessary to the independent prosecution of his favourite
    studies  and which his industrious and prudent habits enabled him in no long time
    in a moderate degree to attain the preface however speaks of this  first attempt
    with some anxiety  and endeavours to bespeak lavour for it as executed  at an
    early period of life and in the retirement of the country this preface is written
    in that nervous but strained  and ornate style which characterises his after writings
    his first contribution to natural philosophy entitled observations on electrical
    theories was also written at etruria and was in  transmitted to the royal society
    of edinburgh for insertion in their transactions this was promised but performance
    having as he thought been long and unhandsomely deferred he indignantly recalled
    his paper and laid it aside for many years it did not indeed see the light till  when
    he was induced to publish it in the edinburgh philosophical journal conducted
    by his distinguished friend professor jameson about the period of the close of
    his agreeable engagement at etruria which was occasioned we believe by the ill
    health of mr thomas wedgewood and the marriage of his younger brother a cornish
    gentleman with whom he had become acquainted at that place proposed to engage
    him as a companion in an extensive tour through greece egypt and the holy land
    ever fond as he was of visitl i e ing foreign countries particularly those hallowed
    by mehe morable events or classical associations the proposal could  j not but
    prove agreeable to him and it was accordingly emi braced with alacrity the tour
    was to commence early in  but a change of plan having been decided upon without
    his concurrence and by which he found that his i observations were to be transferred
    to another he indignantly relinquished the engagement his intention to visit these
    interesting countries when a fit opportunity should occur remained with him through
    life and at a period nearly forty years subsequent to thisin his last years indeedhe
    actually made some preparations for a years sojourn in egypt and palestine from
    which he was diverted only by engagements and avocations of which he found it
    difficult to disencumber himself after leaving etruria he passed some months in
    holland  a country which like descartes he seems to have thought peculiarly suited
    to secluded study and where he at this time acquired the german language thereafter
    he returned to largo where he remained for about two years devoted to experimental
    researches in the course of which he invented and perfected his differential thermometer
    the parent if we may so speak of that beautiful family of philosophical instruments  with
    which he enriched the treasury of science and amplified and variegated the means
    of physical inquiry his ingenuity had been early exercised in some attempts to
    construct an accurate hygrometer and these ultimately suggested to him the wellknown
    contrivance above named a contrivance happily adapted to the measurement of the
    smallest variations of temperature and which richly rewarded his inventive powers
    by its ministry to the achievement of his subsequent discoveries it has generally
    indeed been allowed to be one of the most useful as well as elegant inventions
    that inductive genius ever applied to the investigation of chemical changes at
    a later period when his name had attained a high degree of celebrity he like most
    of the other sons of genius was made to feel that fame brings with it pains as
    well as pleasures for it was now discovered that the differential thermometer
    instead of being an invention of his own perfected as he has himself recorded
    in the course of a series of experiments on the evaporation of ice which the severe
    winter of i afforded him an opportunity of performing  was in reality a plagiarism
    if not from van helmont who died in  at any rate from john christopher sturmius
    who died some sixty years later such was one attempt to impeach the originality
    of this eminently inventive experimentalist an instrument of which all the world
    remained ignorant till he by means of it told the world the better part of all
    it yet knoyrs concerning the phenomena of radiated heat was discovered to have
    been furtively purloined from one or other of these worthies  neither the authors
    nor the abettors of this allegation pretended that either van helmont or sturmius
    ever dreamt of such applications or derived such results from their supposed invention
    as were reserved by some caprice of chance no doubt for its luckier plagiarist
    and it is now we believe allowed that this is just one of those cases of curious
    but partial anticipation so frequently to be met with in the history of science
    and where the ultimate discoverer shows by his skilful and fruitful employment
    of the disputed inven see vol xi p   these instruments viz the differential thermometer
    hygrometer hygroscope photometer pyroscope ethrioscope and atmometer are all described
    and their principles explained by himself in the articles climate and meteorology
    the latter like the former will at the proper place be transferred to this work
    from the supplement to the preceding editions properly speaking the hygrometer
    was the parent instrument the differential thermometer having been invented in
    the course of his endeavours to improve it but as the hygrometer in its latest
    form is only a modification of the other it may be represented as derived from
    it see the article cold  see the article meteorology

    it was augmented to  in the war with hannibal it was raised to   after which it
    declined to  or  the number in the time of polybius the number of legions kept
    in pay together differed according to times and occasions during the consular
    state four legions were organized every year and divided between the two consuls  yet
    we meet with as many as sixteen or eighteen according as the situation of affairs
    required augustus maintained a standing army of twentythree or twentyfive legions  but
    so large a number is seldom found in after times the different legions borrowed
    their names from the order in which they were raised thus legio prima secunda
    tertia but as there might be many primcc secundce tertice they were surnamed from
    the emperors as augusta claudiana galbiana flavia ulpia trajana antoniana  or
    from the provinces which had been conquered by their means as parthica scgthica
    gallica leg arabica  or from the deities under whose protection the commanders
    had particularly placed themselves as minervia apollinaris  or from the region
    where they were quartered as cretensis cyrenaica britannica  or from particular
    accidents as adjutrix martia fulmivatrix rapax victrix each legion was divided
    into ten cohorts each cohort into ten companies and each company into two centuries
    the chief commander of the legion was called legatus or lieutenant the standards
    borne by the legions were various originally the standard was a wolf in honour
    of romuluss nurse  afterwards a hog which animal was usually sacrificed at the
    conclusion of a treaty to indicate that war is undertaken with a view to peace  sometimes
    a minotaur to remind the general of his duty of secresy of which the labyrinth
    was an emblem the figures of a horse and a boar were also borne  and marius we
    are told was the first who exchanged all these for the eagle see army legislation
    the word legislation is used in two senses the one ancient the other comparatively
    modern in its ancient and most ordinary acceptation it comprehends the science
    of law as law ought to be explaining the principles from which law should be universally
    derived and also the rule to be observed in the application of those principles
    to particular countries in its much more recent and restricted sense it is made
    to represent as much of the contents of the municipal laws of a country and as
    much only as is created immediately by the supreme authority acting in its legislative
    capacity in either case it is equally distinguished from the several meanings
    which have at different times been given by the majority of writers to the word
    jurisprudence for instance the science of legislation or what law ought to be
    is carefully separated by mr austin in his province of jurisprudence from the
    science of jurisprudence or the qualities which are common to all lawswhat law
    therefore is and must be which it was the characteristic object of mr austins
    lectures to interpret again legislation in both of the above senses whether used
    as meaning the science of perfect laws or as descriptive of that portion of the
    body of any law which has emanated from the legislature itselfis manifestly a
    very different subject from the jurisprudence prudentia juris of the romans in
    their written wisdom jurisprudence was understood in its more primitive acceptation  in
    the meaning in short which with most persons and for most purposes it still retains
    namely that of a general and scientific knowledge of the laws whatever they may
    be there is a third and later meaning of jurisprudence in which it is narrowed
    down to the usage of the courts this application of it is of french invention
    having been manufactured by them in technical opposition to an equally peculiar
    construction which they had put upon the word legislation this was done with the
    view of distinguishing between the positive letter of the codes termed  legislation
    franaise and judicial decisions  which latter division of their laws they consequently
    thought fit specially to characterize by the name of jurisprudence it is plain
    therefore that upon most occasions legislation and jurisprudence will mean different
    things but on comparing legislation in the first and usual sense as above mentioned
    with the description of natural or universal jurisprudence as copied in a succeeding
    paragraph from adam smith it will appear that until we come to the modifications
    introduced by particular legislation these two sciences are substantially the
    same man bv the very constitution of his nature is social and society supposes
    government investigations into the origin of government as for instance whether
    at its commencement it was patriarchal or military are amongst the creditable
    amusements of conjectural philosophy but they are amusements only when compared
    with practical criticisms on the form and the spirit of particular political institutions
    or with the higher reasonings by which the true principles of a sound constitutional
    system are developed and determined all political institutions are artificial
    constructions admitting of great variety but they may be brought under one or
    other of two comprehensive classes since in whatever hands the supreme authority
    of a state is lodged it must be founded either on the partial interests of certain
    individuals more or less numerous or on the general interest of the whole community
    according to which of these classes a government may happen to belong there will
    be considerable difference in the aspect and object of its legislation  but from
    the moment one or two are gathered together into a society their most pressing
    necessity is that of ascertaining or making the laws upon which the social interests
    of its members are henceforward to depend the universal elements of the science
    of legislation would seem to be sufficiently simple depending on the nature of
    things and of man it may be thought there could be no mistake unfortunately the
    history of the human race has not been so reasonable and so straightforward it
    was late before the nature and condition of man either as an individual or as
    a member of society were analysed with the view of determining the choice between
    opposite means of happiness or of ascertaining the rules of justice in process
    of time most of these questions were settled more or less rudely by the respective
    societies without much consultation amongst each other it was still later before
    the thought occurred of forming into a general system the common principles which
    all nations might be expected to adopt barbarism and sophistry had had such long
    possession and had so confused and complicated the subject that to discover these
    common principles is the great and indeed arduous object of philosophical legislation
    looking at legislation with the help of philosophy and history it is evident that
    its uniformity has always been and must always continue to be disturbed by two
    causes to a certain degree independent of each other these are the form of government
    and the state of civilization the contemporary tendency and character of laws
    will vary

    i which has been employed in their manufacture much  more will they vary with
    as in truth the substance of them is necessarily derived from the condition physical
    and moral the intelligence and the public virtue of each particular community
    the rules of municipal law are  in general intended says adam smith  to coincide
    with those of natural justice it does not indeed always happen that they do so
    in every instance sometimes what is called the constitution of the state that
    is the interest of the government sometimes the interest of particular orders
    of men who tyrannize the government warps the positive laws of the country from
    what natural justice would prescribe in some countries the rudeness and barbarism
    of the people hinder the natural sentiments of justice from arriving at that accuracy
    and precision which in more civilized nations they naturally attain to their laws
    are like their manners gross and rude and undistinguishing in other countries
    the unfortunate constitution of their courts of judicature hinders any regular
    system of jurisprudence from ever establishing itself among them though the improved
    manners of the people may be such as would admit of the most accurate in no country
    do the decisions of positive law coincide exactly in every case with the rules
    which the natural sense of justice would dictate the extent to which he conceived
    these aberrations to have proceeded appears in another passage speaking of the
    civil and criminal law of particular countries he observes  the principles upon
    which those rules either are or ought to be founded are the subject of a particular
    science of all sciences by far the most important but hitherto perhaps the least
    cultivated that of natural jurisprudence adam smith calls the work of grotius
    not only the first but  as yet the most complete on this subject the legislative
    writings of mr bentham which have no necessary connection with his theory of morals
    will form an equal era robert hall observed of mr bentham that  in the particular
    province of his speculations the science of legislation he had advanced the limits
    of reason  and that if he were compelled to legislate for the world upon uninspired
    principles he should take bentham and go from state to state with as firm a step
    as though he walked upon a pavement of adamant had this eminent preacher given
    as much attention to law as to divinity he would have seen that some further deduction
    should be made from this unlimited panegyric there are striking warnings scattered
    over mr benthams treatises upon legislation of the respect due to both the disturbing
    causes above mentioned but the general effect left both by the matter and manner
    of his writings upon most minds is on one important point that of domestic legislation
    inconsistent with the forbearance and caution which he otherwise inculcates for
    instance an ardent disciple impregnated with his principles might be induced to
    alter the laws of his own country at once too suddenly and too far and when the
    alteration was made to err equally in inferring that it was made for ever yet
    mr bentham was fully aw r are of the nature of the limitations and variations
    by which his general theory ought to be accommodated to practice an express dissertation
    on the influence of time and place on subjects of legislation is set apart to
    the solution of the problem how the best laws being given the legislator ought
    to modify them according to temporary and local considerations there is nothing
    to add to his observations and admissions on the necessary effect of caame of
    place with reference to the propriety of transplanting laws from one people to
    another he saw the difficulty of english lawmaking for india but a great deal
    we think is wanting in his sketch of the probable effect of change of time in
    legislapreventing the same laws from being equally suited to tion distant generations
    of the same people he restricts this v v  effect to the constitutional code excluding
    almost entirely the civil and criminal codes from its operation montesquieus spirit
    of laws and the treatise on legislation by m comte are excellent repertories of
    the principal facts by which travellers have established the variety that exists
    amongst the families of the human species scattered over the globe the differences
    between the extreme limits of our common nature to which differences all rational
    legislation will conform are indeed immense it was in this point of view that
    burke received the lessons contained in dr robertsons history of america and felt
    their application to all who have to take part in the government of man the british
    statesman has acknowledged his obligations to the historian of the new world in
    language which those of his countrymen who are bent on judging of all institutions
    by their own standard and on assimilating all nations to themselves would do well
    to recollect  i have always thought that we possess at this time very great advantages
    towards the knowledge of human nature we need no longer go to history to trace
    it in all stages and periods history from its comparative youth is but a poor
    instructor when the egyptians called the greeks children in antiquities we may
    well call them children and so we may call all those nations which were able to
    trace the progress of society only within their own limits but now the great map
    of mankind is unrolled at once and there is no state or gradation of barbarism
    and no mode of refinement which we have not at the same moment under our view
    the very different civility of europe and of china the barbarism of persia and
    of abyssinia the erratic manners of tartary and of arabia the savage state of
    north america and of new zealand all this is very true and yet a given race may
    be no more a fixed quantity the proper subject of an identical legislation than
    the human species itself the historian of the old world has not owing to the effect
    of lapse of time his evidence as accessible as was the case with the historian
    of the new in respect of a removal from one hemisphere to another it should be
    observed however that it happened in the instance of the natives of america that
    both the causes were at work as to the extent of the changes wrought by time in
    the condition and character of the same nation whilst dwelling on the same soil
    nobody can doubt and the legislators of successive periods must notice and follow
    out these changes upon principles precisely similar to the precautions by which
    transplanted legislation is controlled no greater suffering can be inflicted on
    a progressive people than by the attempt at constructing immutable law s on the
    supposition of this partial immutability of nature a system of uniformity and
    contraction which might fix for ages as in a mould some strangely stationary races
    the jews the medes and persians or the chinese must have been torture to the greeks
    even of sparta if the twelve tables had been the perfection of appropriate legislation
    in the age of the decemvirs there can be no question but that justinians institute
    was more in harmony with the contemporaries of tribonian it is probable that the
    koran may not have been even from the first the best possible system for the followers
    of mahommed supposing it to have been so it is very certain that through every
    change of circumstance it could not remain the best for their descendants instead
    of stipulating like the locrians that the man who at any time proposed a new law
    should do so with a halter round his neck when locke undertook to legislate for
    carolina it was on the understanding that his laws were to be revised at the expiration

    cial qualities with which the law is concerned the hindu is not much more remote
    from the european than the actual generation of artificial englishmen is separated
    from the anglosaxon hordes whom nevertheless they represent in blood in language
    and in soil adam smith is for putting a more extended meaning than bentham and
    de tracy will allow on the celebrated saying of solon that he had given the athenians
    if not the best laws the best that they could bear we should say indeed that we
    know of no such thing as an abstract best in positive legislation best for them
    is in their case best to ascertain mr benthams opinion however on this as on other
    subjects the whole body of his writings must be taken together otherwise on looking
    at his personal ambition for becoming the legislator of almost every nation under
    heaven and at his hypothesis that no person was likely to legislate for a country
    so well as a stranger it might be inferred that he was disposed too hastily to
    pull down or to overleap the great partitionwall of national distinctions in the
    same manner the prospect on the effect of time so narrow in the chapter alluded
    to is elsewhere enlarged until it embraces every distant contingency we could
    desire mr bentham is aware that a periodical revision of its provisions will be
    a necessary supplement to a code he was apparently unconscious of the property
    of accommodation which the admirers of the common law have discovered in its popular
    and malleable nature so in his first letter to mr madison in  after observing
    that the common law was nothing but  an ideal and shapeless mass of merely conjectural
    and essentially uncognoscible matter he proceeds to complain of it as unfitted
    to our actual wants   law which being in so far as it could be said to be made
    made at a multitude of successive periods and for the use and governance of so
    many different generations of menmen imbued with notions habituated to modes of
    life differing more or less widely from each other as well as from those which
    have place at presentwould even had it been well adapted to the circumstances
    and exigencies of the times in which its parts came respectively into existence
    have to a considerable degree been thereby rendered not the better adapted but
    by so much the worse adapted to the notions and manners now prevalent to the state
    of things at present m existence admissions more extensive than these as to the
    vast alterations which the quiet hand of time passing over the body of the laws
    and the character and condition of a people must necessarily produce severing
    them from each other wider and wider even modern english lawmakers who are never
    easy but when tinkering at an act of parliament could not possibly require the
    word law in its proper and original sense carries with it the notion of a superior
    this intimation of supremacy is the principal quality conveyed in the widest definition
    of law namely  the expression of a will by a command in this point of view the
    authoritative interposition of conscience enables moralists who adopt the theory
    of conscience to speak with perfect correctness of the law of morals in their
    mouth it is no metaphor what is the nature of the will or of the command which
    may be coupled with the law is an entirely distinct consideration a frequent source
    of misconception that of false analogies would have been avoided if writers had
    more carefully separated the several meanings in which the word law is used above
    all there are two meanings between which it is important to discriminate one in
    which the difference consists in the subject of the laws the other in their author
    the first division is formed by the distinction between matter and the mixed human
    constitutionbetween lcmthe passiveness and uniformity of matter and the free tim
    jor agency and the consequent variableness of imperfect man hence originates the
    complete disseveration of those laws of the material world which simply represent
    what is from the laws of the moral world which represent what ought to be the
    laws of the material world are physical phenomena stated in a general proposition
    the occurrence of a single exception would disprove the law the laws of ethics
    although really derived from and dependent upon human nature presuppose a moral
    assumption with which the facts are to coincide accordingly they will continue
    equally to be the laws of our moral being even whilst they are violated every
    day the second division is formed by the distinction between a perfect and imperfect
    legislator  between the legislative attributes of god and the legislative attributes
    of man if montesquieu had observed the first of these divisions he probably would
    not have put i in apposition so many different senses of the word law as i are
    used in the following sentence nor have left his readers to infer that the same
    word on these several ocl casions meant always the same thing  the deity has  his
    laws  the material world its laws intelligences superior t to man their laws the
    brutes their laws man his laws attention to the second division would have protected
    blacks stone from quoting the description given by cicero of the l i law of nature
    or morals as synonymous with that of posia tive or municipal law  speaking of
    municipal law he has b made the fact of law or no law depend upon its nature  according
    to the latter member of his definition there a can be no such thing as a bad municipal
    law for he detl fines it to be  the rule of civil conduct prescribed by the supreme
    authority in the state commanding what is right m and prohibiting what is wrongt
    the consequence of so sc fallacious a proposition at the threshold has been just
    la what might have been expected a mischievous confuh sion between particular
    and general jurisprudence perla vades and perverts the whole of his elementary
    chapter t l i an assertion of this kind is unfortunately contradicted at ni once
    by the experience of great portions of mankind a tli particular law issuing from
    the supreme authority of the i s state does not cease to be the law within the
    territories of ca that state as long as the supreme authority is strong pr enough
    to enforce it although it should command what fc is wrong and prohibit what is
    right nevertheless a lawto giver approaches to perfection only in proportion as
    he as succeeds in his attempts to realize the other attributes of t al god the
    attributes of goodness and of wisdom as well as ae the coarser attribute of power
    goodness is wanted in order bi to supply general rectitude of intention wisdom
    in order to to estimate the value of every specific end and the aptitude po of
    the means a government with good intentions will a propose for its object the
    happiness of the governed but to a government must be wise as well as good to
    enable it to discover the precise measures by which this object will l be most
    effectually promoted one of the principal provisions of what is called constian
    tutional law is to organize such a system of electoral leit gislation as will
    return to the legislature a representative su body so identified in interest with
    the people as almost to guarantee rectitude in their intention the wisdom of their
    measures will be in proportion to the statesmanlike knowledge of the individual
    members of whom the le i gislature is composed their personal attainments being
    gr combined with and helped out by the knowledge of the an persons whom they may
    happen to consult it is improbable for many reasons that a legislature and more
    especially a popular legislature should at all times or even at l  blackstone  '

  text: w a t t watt provement of estates  was an able man and drew neatly an d accurately
    which was not very common in those days he died in  at an early age leaving  a
    survey of the river clyde from glasgow to the point of toward which was published
    by his brother several years afterwards james his younger brother of an active
    ingenious and enterprising mind became a merchant in greenock and was for upwards
    of twenty years a member of the town council a magistrate and a zealous promoter
    of the improvements of the town by his wife agnes muirhead he had two sons james
    the subject of the present article and john a youth of promising abilities who
    was lost at sea soon after he became of age misfortunes in trade and the decay
    of the faculties of his mind occasioned his retirement from business some years
    before his death which happened in  in his eightyfourth year james watt his eldest
    son and only surviving child was bora at greenock the th january  he received
    the rudiments of his education in the public schools of his native town  but from
    the extreme delicacy of his constitution was with difficulty enabled to attend
    the classes and owed much of his acquirements to his studious habits at home little
    more is known of his early years than that from the first he manifested a partiality
    for mechanical contrivances and operations and frequently employed himself in
    that way the desire of improvement in an art then little practised in scotland
    induced him to go to london in his eighteenth year and there to place himself
    under the tuition of a mathematical instrument maker but he remained little more
    than a twelvemonth the infirm state of his health compelling his return to his
    paternal roof in that short period he appears to have made great proficiency and
    he continued after his return to scotland to perfect himself in this art both
    at home and on his visits to his mothers relations at glasgow where it was his
    wish to establish himself but some opposition being made by the corpoi ations
    who considered him as an intruder upon their privileges the professors of the
    university took him under their protection and accommodated him with an apartment
    and premises for carrying on his business within their precincts with the title
    and office of tnnthematical instrument maker to the university this took place
    in  when he was twentyone years of age and it must be inferred that he had already
    given satisfactory proofs of talent to the eminent men who then adorned that seat
    of learning of whom it is sufficient to mention the names of robert simson adam
    smith dr black and dr dick the professor of natural philosophy there mr watt applied
    sedulously to business and in the few intervals which its concerns and ill health
    allowed cultivated those various talents which distinguished him in after life
    and there a lasting friendship was formed with the kindred minds of dr black and
    of mr afterwards dr robison then a student at the university and nearly of his
    own age he remained in the college until some time in the year  when he removed
    into the town previously to his marriage with his cousin miss miller which took
    place in the summer of the following year the steamengine had been a frequent
    subject of conversation between mr robison and himself and the former had suggested
    the possibility of its application to the moving of wheelcarriages about the year  or  mr
    watt had tried some experiments on the force of steam in a papins digester and
    had constructed and worked with strong steam a small model consisting of an inverted
    syringe the bottom of the rod of wdiich w as loaded with a weight alternately
    admitting the steam below the piston and letting it off to the atmosphere observing
    the imperfections of this construction he soon abandoned it but the attention
    necessary to be bestowed upon his business prevented his reconsidering it until
    the winter of daq wlior  tiroo rvlvtt  a dl l p r  dol when he was employed by
    the professor of natural  v sophy to put in order a working model of a steam p
    n  upon newcomens construction when he had renas  and set it to work he found
    that the boiler though   in proportion to the cylinder was barely able to sunn
    with steam for a few strokes per minute and that a v  quantity of injectionwater
    was required though it uj lightly loaded by the pump attached to it  red that
    the cause lay in the little cylinder two i nc u diameter six inches stroke exposing
    a greater surface condense the steam than the cylinders of larger enein did in
    proportion to their respective contents  by short  ening the column of water in
    the pump less steam and less injectionwater were required and the model worked
    at a proper speed thus the purpose for which it was pm into his hands was accomplished
    and with this mode of account ing for the defect and this result most artists
    would have been satisfied but the case was different with mr watt he had now become
    aware of a great consumption of steam and his curiosity was excited to a more
    accurate investigation of the causes in which he proceeded in a truly philosophical
    manner the cylinder of his small model being of brass he conceived that less steam
    would be condensed by substituting cylinders of some material which would transmit
    heat more slowly he made a larger model with a cylinder six inches diameter and
    one foot stroke of wood soaked in oil and baked to dryness he ascertained from
    experiments made with boilers of various constructions that the evaporation of
    boiling water is neither in proportion to the evaporating surface nor to the quantity
    of water as had been supposed but to the heat that enters it and that the latter
    depended chiefly on the quantity of surface exposed to the action of the fire
    he likewise determined the weight of coal required for the evaporation of any
    given quantity of water being convinced that there existed a great error in the
    statement which had been previously given of the bulk of water when converted
    into steam he proceeded to examine that point by experiment and discovered that
    water converted into steam of the heat of boiling water was expanded to  times
    its bulk or as a rule for ready calculation that a cubic inch of water produced
    a cubic foot of steam he constructed a boiler to be applied to his model which
    should show by inspection the quantity of water evaporated and consequently would
    enable him to calculate the quantity of steam used in every stroke of the engine
    this he now proved to be several times the full of the cylinder he also observed
    that all attempts to improve the vacuum by throwing in more injectionwater caused
    a disproportionate waste of steam  and it occurred to him that the cause of this
    was the boiling of water in vacuo at very low heats recently determined by dr
    cullen to be under  consequently at greater heats the injectionwater was converted
    into steam in the cylinder and resisted the descent of the piston he now perceived
    clearly that the great waste of steam proceeded from its being chilled and condensed
    by the coldness of the cylinder before it was sufficiently heated to retain it
    in an elastic state and that to derive the greatest advantage the cylinder should
    always be kept as hot as the steam which entered it and that when the steam was
    condensed it should be cooled down to  or lower in order to make the vacuum complete
    early in  the fortunate thought occurred to him of accomplishing this by condensing
    the steam in a separate vessel exhausted of air and kept cool by injection between
    which and the cylinder a communication was to be opened every time steam was to
    be condensed while the cylinder itself was to be kept constantly hot no sooner
    had this occurred to him than the means of effecting it presented themselves in
    rapid succession these o v to  icijivi in a great measure have already been described

  text: language  language as the knowledge of languages constitutes a great part
    v  f erudition as their beauties and deformities furnish emgeliius of ppy ment
    t taste and as these depend much upon the language p ms the different tongues
    we shall proceed to make a few remarks upon the advantages and defects of some
    of those idioms of language with which w r e are best acquainted as the words
    idiom and genius of a language are often confounded it will be necessary to inform
    the reader that by idiom we would here be understood to mean that general mode
    of arranging words into sentences which prevails in any particular language  and
    by the genius of a language we mean to express the particular set of ideas which
    the words of any language either from their formation or multiplicity are most
    naturally apt to excite in the mind of any one who hears it properly uttered thus
    although the english french italian and spanish languages nearly agree in the
    same general idiom yet the particular genius of each is remarkably different the
    english is naturally bold nervous and strongly articulated  the french is weaker
    and more flowing the italian more soothing and harmonious and the spanish more
    grave sonorous and stately now when we examine the several languages which have
    been most esteemed in europe we find that there are only two idioms among them
    which are essentially distinguished from one another and all those languages are
    divided between these two idioms following sometimes the one and sometimes the
    other either wholly or in part the languages which may be said to adhere to the
    first idiom are those which in their construction follow the order of nature  that
    is express their ideas in the natural order in which they occur to the mind the
    subject which occasions the action appearing first then the action accompanied
    with its several modifications and last of all the object to which it has reference
    these may properly be called analogous languages and of this kind are the english
    french and most of the modern languages in europe the languages which may be referred
    to the other idiom are those which follow no other order in their construction
    tnan what the taste or fancy of the composer may suggest sometimes making the
    object sometimes the action and sometimes the modification of the action to precede
    or follow the other parts the confusion which this might occasion is avoided by
    the particular manner of inflecting their words by which they are made to refer
    to the others with which they ought to be connected in whatever part of the sentence
    they occur the mind being left at liberty to connect the several parts with one
    another after the whole sentence is concluded  and as the words may be here transposed
    at pleasure those languages may be called transpositive languages to this class
    we must in an especial manner refer the latin and greek languages as each of these
    idioms has several advantages and defects peculiar to itself we shall endeavour
    language to point out the most considerable of them in order to ascertain with
    greater precision the particular character and excellence of some of those languages
    now principally spoken or studied in europe the partiality which our forefathers
    at the revival of letters in europe naturally entertained for the greek and roman
    languages made them look upon every distinguishing peculiarity belonging to them
    as one of the many causes of the amazing superiority which those languages evidently
    enjoyed above every other at that time spoken in europe this blind deference still
    continues to be paid to them as our minds are early prepossessed with these ideas
    and as we are taught in our earliest infancy to believe that to entertain the
    least idea of our own language being equal to the greek or latin in any particular
    whatever would be a certain mark of ignorance or want of taste their rights therefore
    like those of the church in former ages remain still to be examined and we without
    exerting our reason to discover truth from falsehood tamely sit down satisfied
    with the idea of their undoubted preeminence in every respect but if we look around
    us for a moment and observe the many excellent productions which are to be met
    with in almost every language of europe we must be satisfied that even these are
    now possessed of some powers which might afford at least a presumption that if
    they were cultivated with a proper degree of attention they might in some respects
    be made to rival if not to excel those beautiful and justly admired remains of
    antiquity without endeavouring to derogate from their merit let us with the cool
    eye of philosophic reasoning endeavour to bring before the sacred tribunal of
    truth some of those opinions which have been most generally received upon this
    subject and rest the determination of the cause on her impartial decision the
    learned reader well knows that the several changes which take place in the arrangement
    of the words in every transpositive language could not be admitted without occasioning
    great confusion unless certain classes of words were endowed with particular variations
    by means of which they might be made to refer to the other words  with which they
    ought naturally to be connected from this cause proceeds the necessity of several
    variations of verbs nouns and adjectives  which are not in the least essential
    or necessary in the analogous languages as we have pretty fully explained under
    the article grammar to which we refer for satisfaction on this head we shall in
    this place consider whether these variations are an advantage or a disadvantage
    to language as it is generally supposed that every language the verbs of which
    admit of inflection is on that account much more perfect than one where they are
    varied by auxiliaries we shall in the first place examine this with some degree
    of the e lei editions of this work we are far from adopting the very unphilosophical
    opinion which it supports we do not asseit because we could have nothing like
    evidence for such an assertion that the deity did not originallv p bestow on man
    the gift of speech  but we think with lord monboddo and many others that if such
    a boon ever was conferred it must in the revolutions an h it   ri bef t lle  n
    the lu  man race  inevitably have been lost and therefore that as multitudes of
    languages exist and have evei existed the art of speech is one which man is capable
    of attaining to independently of any supernatural aid  this is the view taken
    by our best philosophers thus mr stewart notwithstanding hi allknown caudon forming
    condusit on m n ri subt ai heslt i at  n g i avo ra  i s coimctlon  that  the
    human faculties are competent to the formation of language philosophy of the mind
    vol m chap  in another place the same admirable writer makes the following philosophical
    observations on this subjectthe steps in the formation oflanguage cannot probably
    be determined with certainty  yet if we can show from the known principles of
    human nature how the various parts may naturally have arisen the mind is not only
    to a certain decree satisfied but a check is given to that indolent philosophy
    which refers to a miracle whatever appearances either in the natural or moral
    world it is unable to explain one of the most ingenious attempts that ever has
    been made to show by what steps the human mind would naturally proceed in the
    acquisition of speech is that contained in dr adam smiths  considerations on the
    formation of languages his theory may perhaps be liable to objection in some of
    its details but it is developed with singular clearness and simplicity and it
    must in its general scope and design be allowed by all candid and competent judges
    to beaminently philosophical this essay was annexed by its author to the first
    edition of his theory of moral sentiments  and we are told by mr stewart that
    he always regarded it with great partiality and that he reprinted it without a
    single alteration in the last edition of alongstwitifot  himself revisecl mr stewarts

    tosh  his courteous demeanour refined manners playful fancy v j and easy flow
    of elocution rendered him a general favourite amongst his companions his chief
    associate at kings college was the late reverend robert hall whom the exclusive
    system of the english universities had forced to seek in this northern seminary
    for aat academical education which was denied to him as a dissenter in his own
    country like castor and pollux these young men were assimilated in the minds of
    all who knew them by reason of the equal splendour of their talents although in
    other respects they were extremely unlike they were of the same intellectual stature
    but differently moulded  the one being remarkable for gracefulness of manners
    and symmetry of powers with much elegance and refinement the other plainer and
    withal less polished but distinguished for perfect sincerity ardent piety and
    undeviating love of truth the society and conversation of hall had great influence
    on mackintoshs mind their controversies were almost unceasing even at this early
    period hall  displayed the same acuteness and brilliancy the same extraordinary
    vigour both of understanding and imagination which have since distinguished him
    and which would have secured to him much more of the admiration of the learned
    and the elegant if he had not consecrated his genius to the far nobler office
    of instructing and reforming the poor a  in the spring of  having previously taken
    his degree of master of arts he finally quitted kings college  with he says  but
    little regular and exact knowledge but with considerable activity of mind and
    boundless literary ambition and in the october following he set out for edinburgh
    to commence the study of physic which he had made choice of as a profession his
    arrival in that city opened a new world to his mind edinburgh was then the residence
    of many eminent men  of adam smith dr black john home henry mackenzie dr cullen
    principal robertson dr ferguson dr hutton professor robison mr dugald stewart
    and others and although his age did not allow him to be much acquainted with these
    celebrated persons yet accident furnished him with opportunities of access to
    some of them whilst the concentration of so much genius and talent produced a
    powerful impression on his ardent and susceptible nature his speculative turn
    of mind however soon betrayed itself within a few weeks after his arrival in edinburgh
    he became a zealous partisan of brown who had just become a teacher of medicine
    and the founder of a new medical system  and having been elected a member of the
    medical society he in a few months  before he could have distinguished bark from
    jamess powder or a pleurisy from a dropsy in the chamber of a sick patient discussed
    with the utmost fluency and confidence the most difficult questions in the science
    of medicine but he had soon an opportunity of displaying his peculiar talents
    on a theatre better fitted for the exercise of his powers he was admitted a member
    of the speculative society which had been established about twenty years before
    and during that period numbered amongst its members all the distinguished youth
    in scotland besides many foreigners attracted to edinburgh by the fame of its
    medical school in this society which had general literature and science for its
    objects he found some congenial spirits of whom he has left very graphic sketches
    particularly malcolm laing the historian john w t ilde afterwards professor of
    the civil law in the university of edinburgh benjamin constant adam gillies now
    lord gillies and several other young men who afterwards rose to eminence or attained
    distinction in different pursuits in this exciting atmosphere speculation rather
    than study engrossed his attention youth the season of humble diligence and laborious
    application was wasted as he himself complains in vast mack vain and fruitless
    projects speculators indeed are seldom submissive learners those who will make
    proficiency in useful knowledge must for a time trust to their teachers and believe
    in their superiority but those who too early think for themselves must sometimes
    imagine themselves wiser than their masters  and hence docility is often extinguished
    when the work of education is scarcely commenced after three years spent in irregular
    application he became a candidate for a degree  and having obtained his diploma
    he quitted edinburgh in the month of september  with a large stock of miscellaneous
    information acquired by habitual though desultory reading but without having concentrated
    his powers upon any one pursuit or given to professional subjects that systematic
    and methodical attention which is indispensable to the attainment of professional
    eminence early in  he set out for london accompanied by one of his college friends
    and arrived on that great theatre of action at a moment sufficiently distracting
    for one of more advanced age and more settled pursuits an ardent enthusiast for
    political amelioration he came in contact with society when it was already heaving
    with the first throes of that great convulsion which was soon to overturn all
    the institutions of a neighbouring country and to shake those of every other to
    their lowest foundations to a young man like mr mackintosh a period of such excitement
    had irresistible allurements he had cultivated habits of public speaking both
    at aberdeen and at edinburgh  he was fond of moral and political controversy rather
    perhaps as an exercise of the reasoning powers than with any view to the formation
    of settled opinions he found on the subject of politics the boldest speculations
    in which his mind had been engaged about to receive a practical application  and
    he longed to mingle in the discussions if not to take part in the scenes which
    distinguished that memorable time still his views were in the first instance at
    least directed to the medical profession and he was led from circumstances to
    contemplate a medical appointment in russia but this project in which he was supported
    by mr dugald stewart did not take effect and it is probable that he felt but little
    regret at the failure of a scheme which would have removed him from such a scene
    of interest and enjoyment as london then presented in the same year his fathers
    death freed him from the little control which a soldier of careless and social
    habits had attempted to exercise over a studious youth and as the succession to
    his paternal estate of kellachie brought with it but little advantage to his means
    his habitual profusion in money matters soon involved him in pecuniary difficulties
    his next step was one which seemed but little calculated to diminish them on the
    th of february  he was privately married to miss catharine stuart a young lady
    of a respectable scotch family and at the age of twentyfour he found himself with
    no prospect of any immediate professional settlement his little fortune rapidly
    diminishing and a wife to provide for the struggle regarding the regency that
    followed the announcement of the malady with which the king had been attacked
    in the autumn of  was the occasion of a pamphlet by mr mackintosh in support of
    the analogy which mr fox endeavoured to establish between the actual state of
    his majesty and a natural demise of the crown this seems to have been his first
    public appearance in the field of politics for which his mind had now taken a
    decided turn about the same time he made the acquaintance of horne tooke whose
    cause he warmly espoused at the election for westminster and in whose rich and
    lively but sarcastic conversation he always took great delight another effort

  text: s m e  ie his next publication was  an address to the people of  scotland
    on the nature powers and privileges of juries by a juryman edinb  vo this tract
    is entitled to particular notice because it contains a clear and judicious exposition
    of legal principles very important in themselves and at that period very little
    understood  it is he remarks a common notion that jurymen are judges of theac
    only and not of the laiv this absurd and often fatal prejudice is much more prevalent
    than might be expected in a city like this where general knowledge ought to be
    pretty widely diffused it has perhaps been too much fostered by the injunctions
    of judgesand magistrates it is exceedingly natural that plain simple jurymen should
    look up with veneration to the high rank and superior abilities of those men who
    are appointed by their sovereign to dispense justice over the nation for this
    reason it is that the english judges are so extremely solicitous not to inculcate
    their own opinions on the minds of jurymen but to leave their determinations solely
    to the dictates of their own consciences but from whatever source this prejudice
    may have derived its origin i shall endeavour to shew that it has neither law
    nor common sense for its support a further specimen may very satisfactorily be
    produced  i know it to be the opinion of many jurymen that after the court admits
    a relevancy they are bound by their oaths to find the libel either proved or not
    proved but these gentlemen should consider that their business is to give a verdict
    of a very different kind they are to judge both of the criminality of the culprit
    and of his exculpatory evidence the words proved or not proved should be for ever
    banished from the verdicts of juries a relevancy may be found when the jurymen
    who hear the indictment impugned are of an opposite opinion from the court a crime
    may be libelled when the facts related in the indictment though completely proved
    do not constitute the essence of the crime charged hence whenever the minds of
    jurymen are convinced that a relevancy has been improperly found their verdict
    however the proof may stand should be not guilt i indeed the expressions guilty
    or not guilty ought alone to be employed in verdicts this tract excited a considerable
    degree of attention  and it was quoted with much approbation by lord erskine in
    his famous speech in defence of dr shipley dean of st asaph he published several
    other pamphlets which chiefly related to local politics but the most elaborate
    of his wwks is  the philosophy of natural history edinb  to this is an ingenious
    book written in a very pleasing style and it accordingly experienced a favourable
    reception it was reprinted at dublin and philadelphia lichtenstein published a
    german translation to which some notes were added by c a w zimmermann for the
    original volume charles elliot agreed to pay one thousand guineas at six twelve
    and eighteen months as well as a certain sum for every edition after the first
    this enterprising bookseller died before the work was ready for publication but
    the agreement was mnourably fulfilled by his trustees though the benefit accrued
    not to the author himself but to his family  this says mr kerr was probably the
    largest sum that had ever been given at least in edinburgh for the literary property
    of a single quarto volume and evinced both the libera ity of the bookseller and
    the high estimation in which he very justly held the fame and talents of the author
    his plan however was not yet completed and he immelately applied himself to the
    preparation of a second volume e ived to bring it to a conclusion though not to
    make a ny arrangement for its publication during the last years  is ife his health
    appears to have been infirm and precanous i n june  he stated to his friend dr
    hutton a he had for several months been distressed with a debi v m ms limbs accompanied
    with a want of appetite  and  another medical friend dr gardiner we find him statl
    l i e ing very unfavourable symptoms in the course of the following year after
    a long illness he died on the th of june  at the age of sixtyfive he left a widow
    with four sons and four daughters two sons and three daughters having died before
    their father his eldest daughter was married to mr george watson an eminent portraitpainter
    in edinburgh smellie had never been in affluent circumstances but he left to his
    family the means of prosperity and the printing business has been more successfully
    conducted by his son mr alexander smellie of his philosophy of natural history
    the second volume was published by this son in the year another posthumous work
    speedily followed  literary and characteristical lives of john gregory md henry
    home lord kames david hume esq and adam smith ll d to which are added a dissertation
    on public spirit and three essays edinb  vo his original plan comprehended the
    lives of other twentyfive men of literary eminence with whom he was personally
    acquainted one of these was his friend dr stuart with whose private history he
    was sufficiently familiar and of which he could have supplied very curious though
    perhaps not very edifying details it is not however a subject of much regret that
    his plan was never completed in the specimen with which we have thus been presented
    there is too little biography and too much discussion this remark is more particularly
    applicable to the life of dr gregory which extends to  pages but is almost entirely
    occupied with an account not of the writer but of his writings the other lives
    are of less extent in his account of hume he relates without any symptom of disapprobation
    the indecent levity with which he sported on the verge of another world and in
    the same manner he likewise repeats the declaration of dr smith as to the character
    of that philosopher  i have always considered him both in his lifetime and since
    his death as approaching as nearly to the idea of a perfectly wise and virtuous
    man as perhaps the nature of human frailty will permit this ingenious printer
    may himself have been somewhat too anxious to be classed among philosophers smellie
    appears to have been a man of excellent talents and of extensive knowledge his
    disposition was social his habits were convivial and he was distinguished by a
    sarcastic vein of wit and humour according to the description of his biographer
    he was about the middle size and had been in his youth welllooked and active  but
    when rather past the middle of life he had acquired from almost constantly stooping
    at his desk to write or correct a rather lounging gait and appearance and from
    a longcontinued series of difficulties in his affairs and much disappointment
    in matters of affectionate moment he had become careless and rather slovenly in
    his dress and appearance  wearing his hair long and bushy his ordinary black and
    widemade clothes ill brushed and well sprinkled w ith snuff and his usual oldfashioned
    cocked hat for the most part rusty burns describes him as  a man positively of
    the first abilities and greatest strength of mind as well as one of the best hearts
    and keenest wits that he had ever met with  and in the following lines which allude
    to a club called the crochallan fencibles he has exhibited a graphic delineation
    of smellie  to crochallan came the old cockd hat the brown surtout the same  his
    bristling beard just rising in its might   was tour long days and nights to shavingnight
    his uncombd grizzly locks wild staring thatchd a head for thought profound and
    clear unmatchd and though his caustic wit was biting rude his heart was warm benevolent

  text: e c on o mi s t s mhow in a country where the succession to titles to estates
    ts and even to the crown itself rested upon custom and where the application of
    even the punishment of death was rarely guided by any written definitions the
    government should have thought proper to fix by written laws the length and breadth
    of each piece of cloth and the number of threads which it ought to contain he
    was not less astonished to see the government take in hand to regulate the supply
    of commodities  proscribe one sort of industry in order to make another flourish
    shackle with peculiar restrictions the sale of the most necessary articles of
    subsistence prohibit the storing of commodities of which the quantity produced
    varies greatly from year to year while the quantity required for consumption is
    pretty nearly the same restrain the export and import of a commodity subject to
    the greatest fluctuation of price  and dream of insuring the plentiful supply
    of corn by rendering the condition of the labourer more uncertain and more wretched
    than that of any other part of the community ceuvrese m turgot iii  it may easily
    be imagined that m de gournay would find himself encountered by opposition the
    moment he endeavoured to introduce his beneficial views into practice the grand
    instruments of this opposition were certain words and phrases which have been
    used to screen misrule in every country in which the voice of reform has begun
    to be raised  m de gournay says turgot  was opposed under the names of an  innovator
    and a  theorist for endeavouring to develop the principles which experience had
    taught him and which he found universally recognised by the most enlightened merchants
    of every part of the world among whom he had lived the principles marked out for
    reprobation under the title of the  new system appeared to him to be exactly the
    principles of plain good sense the whole of this system was founded upon the certain
    maxim that in general each man is a better judge of his own interest than another
    man to whom it is a matter of indifference from this m de gournay concluded that
    when the interest of individuals is precisely the same with the general interest
    the best thing to be done is to leave every man at liberty to do what he likes
    now he held it as impossible that in commerce fairly left to itself the interest
    of the individual should not coincide with the interest of the community the proof
    which m turgot gives of the fundamental proposition that the interest of the individual
    and of the community in a free commerce are the same we need not repeat  because
    it can neither be rendered more clear nor more cogent than it is already in works
    with which every person is familiar who is at all conversant with political science  from
    this principle m de gournay concluded that the sole duties of government with
    regard to commerce are  to render to all the branches of industry that precious
    liberty of which the prejudices of barbarous times the proneness of governments
    to lend themselves to the gratification of individual interests and the pursuit
    of a mistaken good have conspired to deprive them   to facilitate the exercise
    of industry and ingenuity to every member of the community exciting thereby the
    greatest competition among sellers and ensuring the greatest perfection and cheapness
    of the commodities sold   to admit the greatest competition among buyers by opening
    to the seller every possible market the sole means of encouraging reproduction
    which hence derives its only reward  to remove every obstacle by which the progress
    of industry is retarded by depriving it of its natural reward it is to m de gournay
    therefore that turgot ascribes the origin of political economy in france  it is
    to the  ardour says he  with which m de gournay endeavoureconoed to direct to
    the study of commerce and of political ecomists nomy all the talent which he was
    able to discover and to the facility with which he communicated the lights which
    he himself had acquired that we ought to ascribe the happy fermentation which
    for some years has been excited on these important subjects a fermentation which
    arose two or three years after m de gournay was intendant of commerce and has
    since that time procured us several works calculated to wipe off from our nation
    that reproach of frivolity which by its indifference for the more useful studies
    it had but too justly incurred francis quesnay was born in the village of ecqueville
    in the year  according to m dupont de nemours the editor and commentator of the
    works of turgot and a zealous economist he was the son of a small proprietor who
    cultivated his own little property  and he was eminently indebted to his mother
    for the fashion of his mind though he was educated as a physician and rose to
    such eminence in his profession as to be first physician to the king the early
    occupation of his mind on the business of agriculture had given the current of
    his thoughts a permanent direction  and when he was summoned to reflect on the
    sources of wealth by the discussions probably to which the speculations of m de
    gournay had given birth agriculture was the object on which his attention was
    more particularly fixed he produced several works on different points of the science
    and practice of medicine  and it was only at a late period of life that his works
    on political economy appeared his chief production on this subject physiocralie
    ou du gouvernement le plus avantageux au genre humain was first published in  not
    only had the speculations which he broached and which he propagated with much
    fervour and diligence considerable success in the world but he had the fortune
    to gain a considerable number of proselytes who exerted themselves with an ardour
    for the diffusion of his doctrine and with a devotion to the opinions of their
    master which more resembled the enthusiasm of the votaries of a new religion or
    that of the followers of some of the ancient philosophers than the indifference
    with which new speculations in philosophy have on all other occasions been received
    in modern europe and which gave to the economists more of the character of a sect
    or a school than has appeared to belong to those who have in recent times concurred
    in any other system of philosophical opinion there was in truth in the system
    of m quesnay and the other economists many things well calculated to attract attention
    and excite enthusiasm from a few simple principles they deduced as they imagined
    by a chain of very close and imposing arguments a system of changes which would
    easily be introduced without the smallest interruption to the tranquillity and
    happiness of the existing generation calculated to remove from society all the
    deformities by which it was overspread and to communicate to the mass of human
    beings a fulness of happiness hitherto altogether unknown at this point therefore
    we may close the historical part of this article  tor the success of the great
    work of dr adam smith in a short time superseded the political economy of the
    sect and after the political economy was discredited the rest of their doctrines
    met with little regard i he memory of them however is well worthy of being preserved
    and this task we shall now in as few words as possible endeavour to perform ii
    the economists proceeded upon no utopian plan which supposes society to be composed
    of beings different from those with whom we are already acquainted they took man
    as he is a being having wants and governed by the desire of avoiding pain and
    obtaining pleasure

  text: economists economake it assume a certain determinable duration between jtusts
    the two but it has not been considered that in physics the direction given does
    not depend upon the opinion of the things which act in morals on the other hand
    the things which are depended upon for counteraction change their duration according
    to their opinion a theory which supposes that to be uniform and constant which
    is known to be the reverse is evidently absurd suppose every thing which the theory
    needs to be supposed conceive an assembly or assemblies provided to counteract
    the sovereign and so constituted as to form the most perfect counteraction possible
    that the sovereign can ordain nothing but with the consent of the assemblies and
    the assemblies nothing but with the consent of the sovereign in this case it is
    not a government of one but a government of many each member of the assemblies
    shares in the sovereignty they are so many partners therefore with a particular
    partner at their head the question is what are the interests of the partnership
    those of the nation or not the interests of the partnership doubtless are to make
    it as profitable to the members as possible for it would be absurd to suppose
    them not governed by their private interests suppose then that there is originally
    a tendency to counteraction between the sovereign and the assemblies it is very
    obvious that they will put an end to this counteraction as far as they discover
    that the suspension of it is conducive to their private interests this is a law
    of nature and may be taken for granted as far then as the serving of the private
    interests of the members is concerned there is no balance of opposite forces the
    forces combine instead of opposing and so far the balance is lost the loss of
    the balance to this extent may be a loss engrossing the whole of the protection
    to the common interest which it was expected to yield or it may be a loss not
    extending so far if it goes to the whole extent of that protection there is to
    the purpose in question no balance at all if it does not go to the whole extent
    there will still be some balance more or less what then is the case  the case
    is that the loss goes to the whole and that the balance does not exist the balance
    does not exist as far as the private interests of those who share among them the
    governing powers are concerned but it is only from the private interests of those
    who govern that the nation has any thing to fear it is only against these interests
    that the balance is provided as far however as these private interests are concerned
    the balance does not exist as far therefore as the balance is even supposed to
    be of any service the balance is excluded by the law of nature it follows as a
    corollary that in a country where the people depend upon what is called a balance
    as the whole of their security for good government they have no security at all
    such is the analysis which the economists present of the causes of good and evil
    in human society and of that order of things which best insures the presence of
    the one and the absence of the other that part of their doctrine which alone is
    yet known to the mere english reader their political economy is introduced as
    only an auxiliary exposition it is part of the development by which they endeavoured
    to prove the identity which they supposed between the interests of the sovereign
    and the interests of the people but as a very distinct account of this part of
    their system has been given by dr adam smith and other writers and as our object
    rather was the exhibition of those doctrines of the sect which nobody has yet
    presented to our countrymen in their own language we shall content ourselves with
    only marking the place which their political economy held in their general system
    as the society has public expenses it is necessary that it also have a public
    revenue to reconcile the formation ecoi of a public revenue with the idea of social
    order it ought mis to be formed if possible without infringing the property y
    of individuals for the sake of which the order of society itself is established
    it ought therefore if possible to be formed without diminishing the revenue of
    individuals when the real origin of revenue the source from which it all is drawn
    is sufficiently understood the mode of forming a revenue for the sovereign without
    diminishing that of individuals would be immediately apparent the source of all
    riches is the land because the land alone of all the sources of production yields
    a produce greater than the cost of the production the surplus produce of the land
    therefore constitutes a fund which is over and above the remuneration to the agents
    of production and out of which the revenue of the sovereign may be taken without
    diminishing the motive to production that is without retarding the natural progress
    of the state in wealth population and felicity to lay the foundation for this
    plan of a public revenue it was necessary to prove that the land is the only source
    of production and that manufactures and commerce though they alter the form of
    things never add any thing to the amount or value of production in the development
    ol these views one of the most remarkable results at which the economists arrived
    was the necessity of perfect freedom to all the proceedings which lead to production  as
    giving to produce that form which is most agreeable to those who are to make use
    of it till the time of the economists the necessity of holding those proceedings
    in chains and binding them to the will of governments was the universal doctrine
    of governments and to a great degree of speculators themselves the general principles
    of the economists respecting ie freedom of property necessary to constitute the
    foundation of social order led them to infer the evil of those abridgments of
    freedom but they examined the inference in detail and showed that the meddling
    officiousness of governments to compel industry to one thing and exclude it from
    another not only failed to effect any good purposes but of necessity created obstructions
    of the greatest magnitude to production in general and tended powerfully to keep
    down the wealth population and prosperity of the state the light which they diffused
    on this subject and which soon produced a grand effect on the minds of men was
    a good the magnitude of which is beyond calculation another of their conclusions
    is that the revenue of the sovereign taken as they said it ought to be wholly
    from the net produce of the land ought to be a fixed and unalterable proportion
    of that produce the reason appeared to them conclusive if the proportion was variable
    and depended upon the will of the owners of the land they might be induced to
    break upon the public revenue and deprive the state of those benefits which the
    public revenue is necessary to produce if it depended upon the sovereign the property
    of the land might be detached from that of its produce nobody would have a motive
    to become a proprietor in land and all the advantages which depend on the existence
    of that property would be lost the production of subsistence would fail and the
    community could not exist this proportion being once fixed there is no longer
    any contrariety between the interest of the sovereign and the interest of any
    portion of his people  and the proprietors of land are as completely and securely
    exempt from contributing to the expense of the state as any other class of the
    community the sovereign derives no part of his revenue from the subject and this
    deplorable source of the conflict of interests is wholly cut off the proportion
    being settled for ever between the sovereign and the land

  text: black  black for science that a situation so favourable presented itself dr
    joseph a situation which allowed him full time to dedicate his talents to the
    cultivation of chemistry which had now become his favourite science along with
    the lectureship on chemistry dr blacks first appointment in the university of
    glasgow was to the professorship of anatomy but the latter branch of medical study
    was either not so suitable to his taste or he did not consider himself so well
    qualified to be useful in it for soon after arrangements were made with the professor
    of medicine by which the professors exchanged departments dr black undertaking
    that of the institutes and practice of medicine at this time his lectures on medicine
    formed his chief occupation  while the perspicuity and simplicity the caution
    and moderation which he discovered in the doctrines which he delivered gave great
    satisfaction the time and attention which were occupied in these lectures and
    in the medical practice in some measure necessarily connected with his situation
    are supposed by some to have been the principal cause of dr blacks having suddenly
    stopped short in that brilliant career on which he had at first so successfully
    entered it is more probable however that the calm and unambitious temper which
    seems to have formed a striking feature of his character and which a less friendly
    hand than his learned biographer might have set down as nearly allied to indolence
    checked the ardour and perseverance which were necessary to excite and carry him
    forward in the path of research and discovery whatever may have been the cause
    it is to be regretted that dr black so conspicuous for his patient judicious and
    elegant mode of investigation and so distinguished for the simplicity perspicuity
    and precision of his reasonings and deductions should have contributed so little
    in rearing the noble superstructure of chemical science the foundation of which
    he had been the means of establishing on a firm and solid basis the theory of
    the nature of quicklime and the cause of its causticity soon became known to the
    german chemists and from them it met with strong opposition various mysterious
    doctrines at this time prevailed in the german schools concerning the peculiar
    nature of fire  and as the notions there entertained of the causticity of alkaline
    substances involved some of these doctrines a great many objections were started
    to a theory which threatened to overthrow long established and favourite opinions
    the most formidable opponent of the new theory was professor meyer of osnaburg
    all the phenomena of the causticity and mildness of lime and alkali were according
    to his explanation to be accounted for by the action of a substance of a peculiar
    nature to which he gave the name of acidum pingue this substance which was supposed
    to be formed in the lime during calcination consisted of an igneous matter in
    a certain state of combination with other substances it is a matter of some surprise
    that dr black should have experienced any uneasiness on account of the opposition
    made to this discovery on mere hypothesis unsupported by facts or even by plausible
    arguments when his own doctrine had been fully and irrefragably established by
    the test of decisive experiment nor is it less surprising that in the course of
    his lectures for several years he should have taken great pains in refuting the
    arguments and in combating the objections of meyer dr blacks reception at the
    university of glasgow was highly flattering and encouraging as a student he had
    not only done himself much credit by his successful progress in the different
    pursuits in which he was engaged but he had also during his residence there conciliated
    in a high degree the attachment and affection of the professors when he returned
    as a professor he immediately became connected in the strictest friendship with
    dr bl adam smith then professor of moral philosophy in that dr j ph university
    and the friendship thus commenced grew    stronger and stronger and was never
    interrupted throughout the whole of their lives a simplicity and sensibility an
    incorruptible integrity the strictest delicacy and singular correctness of manners
    marked the character of each of these philosophers and firmly bound them together
    in the closest union at glasgow dr black soon acquired great reputation as a professor
    and became a favourite physician in that large and active city his engaging countenance
    his agreeable and attractive manners free from all studied endeavours to please
    and the kind concern he took in the cases intrusted to his care made him a most
    welcome visitor in every family it was between the years  and  that he brought
    to maturity his speculations concerning heat which had occupied his attention
    at intervals from the very first dawn of his philosophical investigations his
    discoveries in this department of science were by far the most important of all
    that he made and perhaps indeed among the most valuable which appeared during
    the busy period of the eighteenth century to enter fully into the nature of his
    investigations would be improper in this place  but the sum of them all was usually
    expressed by him in the following propositions when a solid body is converted
    into a fluid there enters into it and unites with it a quantity of heat the presence
    of which is not indicated by the thermometer and this combination is the cause
    of the fluidity which the body assumes on the other hand when a fluid body is
    converted into a solid a quantity of heat separates from it the presence of which
    was not formerly indicated by the thermometer and this separation is the cause
    of the solid form which the fluid assumes when a liquid body is raised to the
    boiling temperature by the continued and copious application of heat its particles
    suddenly attract to themselves a great quantity of heat and by this combination
    their mutual relation is so changed that they no longer attract each other but
    are converted into an elastic fluid like air on the other hand when these elastic
    fluids either by condensation or by the application of cold bodies are reconverted
    into liquids they give out a vast quantity of heat the presence of which was not
    formerly indicated by the thermometer thus water when converted into ice gives
    out  of heat ice when converted into water absorbs  of heat and water when converted
    into steam absorbs about  of heat without becoming sensibly hotter than  philosophers
    had long been accustomed to consider the thermometer as the surest method of detecting
    heat m bodies yet this instrument gives no indication of the  of heat which enter
    into air when it is converted into water nor of the  which combine with water
    when it is converted into steam dr black therefore said that the heat is concealed
    jatet in the water and steam and he briefly expressed this fact by calling the
    heat in that case latent heat dr black having established this discovery by simple
    and decisive experiments drew up an account of the whole investigation and read
    it to a literary society which met every friday in the facultyroom of the college
    consisting of the members of the university and several gentlemen of the city
    who had a relish for philosophy and literature this was done on the d of april  as

  text: agriculture  must strike every practical man is that corn is not the a ft  only
    produce of a farm and in most parts of britain perca haps not the principal source
    from which rent is paid and there is no authentic record of the prices of butchermeat
    wool cheese butter and other articles in every county to refer to as there is
    of corn this is not the place to inquire whether the price of corn regulates the
    price of all the other products of land in a country whose statutebooks are full
    of duties bounties drawbacks c to say nothing of its internal regulations  but
    it is sufficiently evident that if corn does possess this power its price operates
    too slowly on that of other products to serve as a just criterion for determining
    rent on a lease of this duration besides in the progress of agriculture new species
    or varieties of the cerealia themselves are established even in so short a period
    as twentyone years the price of which may be very different from that of the corn
    specified in the lease what security for a full rent for instance would it give
    to a landlord to make the rent payable according to the price of barley when the
    tenant might find it more for his interest to cultivate some of the varieties
    of summer wheat  or according to the price of a particular variety of oats when
    within a few years we have seen all the old varieties superseded throughout extensive
    districts by the introduction of a new one the potatooat which may not be more
    permanent than those that preceded it  there may be no impropriety in adopting
    this plan for ascertaining the rent of land kept always in tillage but it would
    be idle to expect any important benefits from it during such a lease as we have
    mentioned in some instances it is the practice to agree for a certain rent in
    money which does not vary and another portion is determined from time to time
    by the price of corn the quantity and kinds of the corn only being previously
    fixed by the lease this we think is a better plan than to make the whole rent
    vary with the price of corn with regard to much longer leases this plan will no
    doubt diminish the evils which we think are inseparable from them but it cannot
    possibly reach some of the most considerable its utmost effect is to secure to
    the landholder a rent which shall in all time to come be an adequate rent according
    to the state of the lands and the mode of cultivation known at the date of the
    lease but it can make no provision that will apply to the enlargement of the gross
    produce from the future improvement of the lands themselves or of the disposable
    produce from the invention of machinery and other plans for economizing labour
    old cornrents therefore though much higher at present than old moneyrents are
    seldom or never so high as the rents that could now be paid on a lease of twentyone
    years but independently of these considerations which more immediately bear upon
    the interests of the parties themselves one insuperable objection to all such
    leases is that they partake too much of the nature of entails and depart too far
    from that commercial character which is most favourable to the investment of capital
    and consequently to the greatest increase of land produce nts a lease for a term
    of years is not however in all cases a sufficient encouragement to spirited cultivation
    its covenants in respect to the management of the lands may te injudicious the
    tenant may be so strictly confined to a particular mode of culture or a particular
    course of crops as not to be able to avail himself of the beneficial discoveries
    which a progressive state of agriculture never ai s to introduce or on the other
    hand though this is oiuch more rare the tenant may be left so entirely at  erty
    that either the necessity of his circumstances durvol ii  mg the currency of the
    lease or his interest towards its agriculexpiration may lead him to exhaust the
    soil instead of ture  rendering it more productive when a lease therefore is either
    redundant or deficient in this respectwhen it either permits the lands to be deteriorated
    or prevents their improvementthe connection between landlord and tenant is formed
    upon other views and regulated by some other principle than the general one on
    which we think it should be founded notwithstanding the high authority of adam
    smithrestrictive covenants are always necessary to the security of the landlord
    and in some cases beneficial also to the tenant their expediency cannot well be
    questioned in those parts of the country where an improved system of agriculture
    has made little progress a landholder assisted by the advice of experienced men
    in framing these covenants cannot adopt any easier or less offensive plan for
    the improvement of his property and the ultimate advantages of his tenantry even
    in the best cultivated districts while farms continue to be let to the highest
    responsible offerers a few restrictive covenants cannot be dispensed with the
    supposed interest of the tenant is too feeble a security for correct management
    even during the eailier part of a lease and in the latter part of it it is thought
    to be his interest in most cases to exhaust the soil as much as possible not only
    for the sake of immediate profit but frequently in order to deter competitors
    and thus to obtain a renewal of his lease at a rent somewhat less than the lands
    would otherwise bring with tenants at will and such as hold on short leases restrictive
    covenants are more necessary than with tenants on leases of  or  years but in
    many instances they are too numerous and complicated and sometimes even inconsistent
    with the best courses of modern husbandry the great error lies in prescribing
    rules by which a tenant is positively required to act not in prohibiting such
    practices and such crops as experience has not sanctioned i he improved knowledge
    and the liberality of the age have now expunged the most objectionable of these
    covenants and throughout whole counties almost the only restriction in reference
    to the course of crops is that the tenant shall not take two culmiferous crops
    ripening their seeds in close succession this single stipulation combined with
    the obligation to consume the straw upon the farm and to apply to it all the manure
    made from its produce is sufficient not only to protect the land from exhaustion
    but to insure in a great measure its regular cultivation for half the farm at
    least must in this case be always under either fallow or green crops the only
    other necessary covenant when the soil is naturally too weak for carrying annual
    crops without intermission is that a certain portion of the land shall be always
    in grass not to be cut for hay but depastured according to the extent of this
    will be the interval between the succession of corn crops on the same fields if
    it is agreed that half the farm for instance shall always be under grass there
    can be only two crops of corn from the same field in six years in this case not
    more than twosixths being in corn onesixth in green crops or fallow and threesixths
    in clovers or grasses it becomes almost impossible to exhaust any soil at all
    fitted for tillage there are few indeed that do not gradually become more fertile
    under this course of cropping it is sufficiently evident that other covenants
    are necessary in particular circumstances such as permission to dispose of straw
    hay and other crops from which manure is made when a quantity of manure equal
    to what they would have furnished is got from other places and a prohibition against
    converting rich old grazing lands or meadows into cornlands in  x

    and a discourse being published in the philosophical transactions in order to
    invalidate some of his opinions he thought proper in an account which he gave
    of his book in the same transactions to take notice of those experiments in consequence
    of this discussion several of his dissertations on the resistance of air were
    read and the experiments exhibited before the royal society for which he was presented
    by that honourable body with a gold medal in gib appeared lord ansons voyage round
    the world which though mr walters name is in the title has been generally thought
    to be the work of robins walter chaplain on board the centurion had brought it
    down to his departure from macao for england when he proposed to print the work
    by subscription it was however it is said thought proper that an able judge should
    review and correct it and robins was appointed  when upon examination it was resolved
    that the whole should be written by robins and that walters papers should only
    serve as materials hence the introduction entire and many dissertations in the
    body of the work it is said w r ere composed by him without receiving the least
    assistance from walters manuscript which chiefly related to the wind and the w

    which they anchored and such particulars as generally fill up a sailors account
    no production of this kind ever met with a more favourable reception  four large
    impressions were sold within a twelvemonth  and it has been translated into most
    of the languages of europe the fifth edition printed at london in  was revised
    and corrected by robins himself in the corrigenda and addenda to the first volume
    of the biographia britannica printed in the beginning of the fourth volume of
    that work it is however stated that robins was only consulted with respect to
    the disposition of the drawings and that he had left england before the book was
    printed whether this be the fact as it is asserted to be by the widow of mr walter
    it is not for us to determine robins was soon afterwards desired to compose an
    apology for the unfortunate affair at prestonpans it was prefixed as a preface
    to  the report of the proceedings of the board of general officers on their examination
    into the conduct of lieutenantgeneral sir john copeand this preface was esteemed
    a masterpiece in its kind he afterwards through the interest of lord anson contributed
    to the improvements made in the royal observatory at greenwich having thus established
    his reputation he vas offered the choice of two considerable employments either
    to go to paris as one of the commissaries for adjustiig the limits of acadia or
    to be engineergeneral to the last india company he chose the latter and arrived

    been a merchant at glasgow and had retired to live in considerable affluence on
    his estate at boghall not far from that city he was of a family sufficiently respectable

    of the court of st petersburg a gentleman born as a younger brother that son was
    originally intended for the church and went at an early age according to the custom
    of scotland in   to enter as a student in the university of glasgow so that he
    was initiated almost in the rudiments of grecian literature under the able instruction
    of dr moor the wellknown professor of greek and he acquired such a knowledge of
    the classical languages as served to constitute him a correct scholar through

    mathematics under dr robert feimson and amoral philosophy under dr adam smith
    the example of so correct and rigid a follower of the ancient methods of demonstration

    yet unformed taste in mathematics but he seems to have had a natural preference
    either from the constitution of his mind or from some previously acquired habits
    of thinking for the geometrical method  for we are informed that  he first attracted
    the regard of dr simson by owning his dislike of algebra and by returning a neat
    geometrical solution of a problem which had been given out to the class in an
    algebraical form  with this mode of solution the professor was delighted though
    the pupil candidly acknowledged that it had been adopted only because he could
    not solve the problem in the manner required of the class in the course of his
    studies he had imbibed an insuperable aversion to the pursuit of his original
    objects in the church  not certainly from any want of religious feeling or from
    a dislike to the kind of life that was intended for him but probably from some
    difficulties that had occurred to him respecting particular points of doctrine
    or of practice he was therefore compelled to provide himself with some other occupation  and
    he readily accepted the offer of some of his friends in  to recommend him to dr

  text: m i r a b e a u abeaujust convoked mirabeau at once plunged into these discusvsions
    in the only way compatible with his precarious existence namely by publishing
    a violent diatribe entitled denonciation de vagiotage in which personalities were
    accumulated without reserve against both calonne and necker the consequence was
    an order of the king which condemned the pamphleteer to imprisonment in the castle
    of saumur but mirabeau evaded the intended punishment and having placed himself
    in safety published the suite de la denonciation  and in his lettres a m lacretelle
    as well as in his correspondance avec cerutti he scrupled not to assail the reputation
    of necker which was then at its height these productions appear to have made a
    considerable impression in fact mirabeau gained much celebrity by his polemical
    writings at a time when political subjects had not yet entered into the circulation
    of common ideas when the art of pamphleteering was scarcely cultivated and only
    a small number of writers ventured to engage in this species of warfare they were
    attractive novelties  and their effect was enhanced by his dogmatic and tranchant
    manner of handling subjects which he had scarcely studied and especially by the
    haughty and arrogant tone which he assumed towards his adversaries but if he had
    aggrandized his reputation as a writer his personal character had sunk to the
    very lowest possible state of degradation his discreditable employment as a sort
    of licensed spy at berlin his open connection with the enemies of necker and his
    ingratitude to calonne made him be regarded as a dangerous enemy and a slippery
    friend  whilst his lawsuits with his family his elopements his imprisonments and
    his morals could not be overlooked even in a city so lax as paris  and hence his
    name was pronounced with detestation and his company shunned qs if he had carried
    about with him some deadly infection but common fame is almost always in excess
    either on the one side or the other he was by no means the abandoned and demoralized
    monster he was at this time generally thought to be  on the contrary there were
    high and redeeming qualities in his nature which afterwards displayed themselves
    on a great theatre of action and amidst alfhis excesses he never lost his respect
    for virtue nor his taste for the society of those whose principles and habits
    formed a perfect contrast to his own in  his monarchic prussienne appeared at
    paris in eight volumes vo with an atlas in folio this production consisted of
    a work written for him by major mauvillon and of extracts from different memoirs
    procured at great expense no one can for a moment suppose that during a residence
    of only eight months at berlin mirabeau could himself have executed a work of
    such magnitude in which every possible information had been introduced respecting
    t e geography productions manufactures commerce and military condition of prussia
    as well as concerning the reigion education legislation and administrative system
    of that country but he had the merit of employing the talents of an officer who
    was scarcely known to the government he served and the prussian ministers must
    have een much surprised at finding that a man who had reside so short a time in
    the country could singly undertake so arduous a task and succeed in supplying
    them with more materials than could be found in the united offices o their several
    departments  the work says dumont js an illustration by facts of adam smiths principles
    of po itical economy  and it clearly proves that prussia has a ways been a sufferer
    whenever she has departed from these principles his next publication was one of
    a much less creditable c aracter  he histoire secrete du cabinet de berlin is
    an m iscreet revelation of the diplomatic manoeuvres of mirabeau written in a
    spirit of bitter criticism with all the icentious freedom of a libel and it excited
    general indigvol xv   nation against the author who had unscrupulously violated
    mirabeau the secrets of hospitality and the confidence of his friends s v as well
    as that of the government in order to supply pabuum to public malignity in this
    disgraceful production the emperor joseph ii the king of prussia and particularly
    prince henry who was then at paris were all equally ill treated louis xvi conceived
    that some satisfaction was due to the diplomatic corps who had been so grossly
    assailed and accordingly the libel was adjudged by the parliament to be burned
    by the hands of the common hangman the worst passage of mirabeaus life is the
    publication of the letters to sophie but that of the berlin correspondence is
    equally without justification although on different grounds in extenuation of
    this proceeding it has been observed that the whole object of his existence depended
    upon the supplies which it furnished  that without it his election in provence
    wmuld have been hopeless but this is a sorry topic even of palliation great events
    were now near at hand on the th of december  the longexpected royal proclamation
    appeared definitively convoking the statesgeneral for may  need we ask whether
    mirabeau now bestirred himself whether or not he was off to provence to the assembly
    of the noblesse with all his faculties screwed to the stickmgplace  a prospect
    had at length opened to him of rising superior to the humiliation of his youth
    and the contempt attached to the precarious and degraded life he had led  he seems
    to have had a presentiment of the part which he was soon destined to perform in
    a mighty revolution now about to commence  and he lost no time in taking means
    to bring about the accomplishment of his destiny in the list of the popular candidates
    his name was accordingly proclaimed in all parts of provence beside that of raynal
    and he laboured with unwearied activity in stimulating public feeling proclaiming
    the necessity of political regeneration denouncing abuses exposing tyranny and
    misgovernment agitating and contending by day writing pamphlets and paragraphs
    by night and in short strainmg every nerve to attain the first and grand object
    of his ambition nevertheless when he presented himself in the assembly of the
    noblesse to vote with his peers the latter excluded him upon the pretence that
    the possessors of fiefs alone had the right of sitting amongst them against this
    fatal decision which confirmed the alienation of the most dangerous enemy which
    the ignorance and insolence of a privileged order raised up for their own overthrow
    mirabeau protested in eloquent and energetic terms exposing the folly of his order
    and prognosticating the doom which it was now preparing for itself we can only
    afford room for two paragraphs of this celebrated remonstrance  what have i done
    that was so criminal  he exclaimed  i have wished that my order were wise enough
    to give today what will infallibly be wrested from it tomorthat it should receive
    the merit and glory of sanctioning the assemblage of the three orders which all
    provence loudly demands this is the crime of your  enemy of peace or rather i
    have ventured to believe that the people might be in the right ah doubtless a
    patrician soiled with such a thought deserves vengeance but i am still guiltier
    than you think for it is my belief that the people which complains is always in
    the right that its indefatigable patience invariably waits the uttermost excesses
    of oppression before it can determine on resisting that it never resists long
    enough to obtain complete redress and does not sufficiently know that to strike
    its enemies into terror and submission it has only to stand still that the most
    innocent as the most invincible of all powers is the power of refusing to act

  text: coinage coinage lowering that of gold it may be inferred that the legislature
    were aware that the gold coin had attained the prerogative of being the standard
    of value at this time though the recommendation in sir isaac newtons report was
    carried into effect by making the guinea current at s yet it did not restore silver
    to its function as the standard of our money and this because the current value
    was not made still lower sir isaac newton seemed aware of this himself and recommended
    that lod or d should be taken from the guinea instead of d i his however was not
    done  and as the rate of s to the guinea the proportion of standard gold to standard
    silver at the mint was as  to  the proportion of the market as we find by the
    prices of gold and silver at this period in castaigns papers was about d to  which
    constitutes a difference of about three per cent gold being still thus much rated
    above its value to silver and consequently not only was no silver coined but the
    good and heavy coins were still melted for the high price they brought in the
    state of bullion it is surprising that the government having seen the operation
    of the principle recommended in the report of sir isaac newton did not carry it
    a little farther and bring the current value of the guinea to a par with the market
    proportion of the two metals and so render it the interest of the public to cany
    silver to the mint to be coined before concluding our observations upon this highly
    interesting subject we must remark that mr locke himself did not impute the high
    price of silver after the recoinage to the cause to which we have here ascribed
    it he attributed it to the permission to export silver bullion and to the prohibition
    of exporting silver coin this permission he said rendered the demand for silver
    bullion greater than the demand for silver coin dr adam smith remarks upon this
    opinion that the number of people who want silver coin for the common uses of
    buying and selling at home is surely much greater than that of those who want
    silver bullion either for exportation or any other purpose there subsists at present
    a like permission of exporting gold bullion and a like prohibition oi exporting
    gold coin and yet the price of gold bullion has fallen below the mint price but
    in the english coin silver was then in the same manner as now underrated in proportion
    to gold  and the gold coin which at that time was not supposed to require any
    reformation regulated then as well as now the real value of the whole coin no
    other legislative measure having been taken than that which we have mentioned
    founded upon the report of sir isaac newton and the market proportion of gold
    to silver having seldom rendered it the interest of the public to coin silver
    this accounts satisfactorily for the degiaded state of our silver currency during
    the last century itecoinae in the year  and subsequent years we had a geneof gold
    in ral recoinage of our gold currency which forms the next i prominent feature
    of our mint history the avowed object of this recoinage was a reformation of the
    light and defective coins then in circulation and the motive for doing so was
    to prevent the new and heavy coins from being selected from the circulation and
    melted for the high price which the gold brought in the state of bullion in fact
    l of the gold coin then in circulation would not weigh more than an ounce and
    by reference to the prices paid by the bank for gold we find that this was the
    market price the holders of bank notes demanding new and heavy coins for them
    required the bank to have a large coinage of gold annually to supply this demand
    these coins were melted and sold in the state of bullion to the bank for the high
    price of l per ounce to remedy this inconvenience the recoinage was completed
    and it had the effect desired for the price of gold during more than twenty years
    never exceeded but was coinage rather under its mint price political economists
    have disagreed as to the cause of the high price of gold previously to the recoinage
    dr smith says  by issuing too great a quantity of paper of which the excess was
    continually returning in order to be exchanged for gold and silver the bank of
    england was for many years together obliged to coin gold to the extent of between
    eight hundred thousand and a million a year or at an average about eight hundred
    and fifty thousand pounds for this great coinage the bank in consequence of the
    worn and degraded state into which the gold coin had fallen a few years ago was
    obliged frequently to purchase bullion at the high price otl per ounce which it
    soon after issued in coin at l s  d an ounce  losing in this manner between  and  per
    cent upon the coinage of so very large a sum though the bank therefore paid no
    seignorage though the government was properly at the expense of the coinage this
    liberality of government did not prevent altogether the expense of the bank mr
    ricardo very justly remarks upon this passage that  on the principle above stated
    it appears most clear that by not reissuing the paper thus brought in the value
    of the whole currency of the degraded as well as the new gold coin would have
    been raised when all demands on the bank would have ceased or in other words the
    price of gold would have fallen to its mint pi ice mr buchanan is not of this
    opinion for he says  that the r reat expense to which the bank was at this time
    exposed was occasioned not as dr smith seems to imagine by any imprudent issue
    of paper but by the debased state of the currency and the consequent high price
    of bullion the bank it will be observed having no other way of procuring guineas
    but by sending bullion to the mint to be coined was always forced to issue new
    coined guineas in exchange for its returned notes and when the cunency was generally
    deficient in weight and the price of bullion high in proportion it became profitable
    to draw these heavy guineas from the bank in exchange for its paper to convert
    them into bullion and to sell them with a profit for bank paper to be again returned
    to the bank for a new supply of guineas which were again melted and sold to this
    drain of specie the bank must always be exposed while the currency is deficient
    in weight as both an easy and a certain profit then arises from the constant interchange
    of paper for specie it may be remarked how ever that to whatever inconvenience
    and expense the bank was then exposed by the drain of its specie it never was
    imagined to be necessary to rescind the obligation to pay money for notes at xi
    mr ricardo remarks upon this passage that  mr buchanan evidently thinks that the
    whole currency must necessarily be brought down to the level of the value of the
    debased pieces but surely by a diminution of the quantity of the currency the
    whole that remains can be elevated to the value of the best pieces with this opinion
    of mr ricardo we cordially agree and it is upon this principle that a seignorage
    can be laid upon coinage without any one directly paying for it as a tax by restricting
    the quantity of a currency this seignorage may be   or even  per cent and the
    price of gold neither raised above its mint price nor the bank subjected to a
    run for guineas   during the period of these important transactions the new conconstitution
    of the mint remained without alteration ithutiono had not however escaped the
    attention of the legislature  uie  for we find that on the th of february  his
    majesty by an order in council was pleased to appoint a committee of his privy

  text: con aidiistgations and from whose family he had received a most j accomplished
    wife with a large fortune but it is believed that this calumny originated entirely
    from the malevolence of party spirit when the trial of the king came to be agitated
    condorcet gave it as his opinion that he could not be brought to judgment in a
    legal manner yet it must be confessed that his conduct in regard to the sentence
    was rather of an ambiguous nature and betrayed that timidity and want of resolution
    which formed the most prominent feature of his political career the judgment of
    madame roland concerning the moral constitution of this wonderful man has the
    air of perfect impartiality  the genius of condorcet said that lady  is equal
    to the comprehension of the greatest truths but he has no other characteristic
    besides fear it may be said of his understanding combined with his person that
    it is a fine essence absorbed in cotton the timidity which forms the basis of
    his character and which he displays even in company does not result from his frame
    alone but seems to be inherent in his soul and his talents furnish him with no
    means of subduing it thus after having deduced a principle or demonstrated a fact
    in the assembly he would give a vote decidedly opposite overawed by the thunder
    of the tribunes armed with insults and lavish of menaces the properest place for
    him was the secretaryship of the academy such men should be employed to write
    but never permitted to act after the execution of the king the girondin party
    employed him to frame a new constitution the plan of which was presented to the
    convention and obtained their approbation it was not thus esteemed by the people
    at large and it has perhaps not without reason been considered as a mass of metaphysical
    absurdities during the violent struggle between the girondin and mountain parties
    condorcet took no decided part with either which seems to have been owing to the
    native timidity of his mind and his abhorrence of the state of public affairs
    he was not comprehended among the number of those who were sacrificed with their
    leader brissot but having employed his pen against the victorious party he fell
    under the invincible displeasure of that inhuman and bloodthirsty monster robespierre
    who issued a decree of accusation against him in july  he however found means
    to effect his escape from the arrest and during nine months concealed himself
    in paris but at length dreading that the tyrant would order a domiciliary visit
    for the purpose of discovering the place of his retreat he passed through the
    barriers without being noticed and went to the house of a person in whom he confided
    on the plain of montrouge unfortunately for condorcet however this friend was
    at that time in the metropolis and he was in consei quence under the necessity
    of passing two dreary nights in the open fields a prey to hunger and to cold on
    the third day he obtained an interview with his friend who unhappily durst not
    venture to afford him shelter under his roof so that he was once more compelled
    to wander in the fields at length worn out by hunger and fatigue and life being
    no longer supportable without sustenance he applied at a public house for an omelette
    which as soon as he obtained it he devoured greedily his cadaverous appearance
    and uncommonly keen appetite roused the suspicion of a municipal officer who happened
    to be present and by whom he was interrogated and the ambiguity and hesitation
    which characterized his answers made the officer conclude that it would be proper
    to apprehend him he was accordingly consigned to a dungeon to be next day conducted
    to paris but his melancholy fate rendered such a measure unnecessary he was found
    dead in the morning and as it was generally understood that he constantly carried
    with him a dose of poison to this cause his vol vii con  melancholy exit was ascribed
    thus terminated the cacondorcet reer of condorcet on the th of march  who for
    ii many years sustained a brilliant and honourable reputacondormition in the republic
    of letters his manners were replete  ene  with urbanity and he was as well qualified
    to please in company as could be expected in a man who w r as conceived whether
    rightly or not to be destitute of heart la bonte brillait dans ses yeux says grimm  et
    il auiait eu plus de tort qu aucun autre de netre pas honnete homme parce qu il
    aurait trompe davantage par sa physionomie qui annonait les qualites les plus
    paisibles et les plus douces his character though not exempt from pride was always
    peaceful and obliging he appeared timid and embarrassed in a numerous circle but
    with his friends he displayed a gaiety and liveliness quite fascinating and never
    made any pretensions to superiority on account of the great extent of his knowledge
    he had read a great deal and his memory was prodigious soon after his death appeared
    his sketch of an historical draught of the progress of the human mind a methodical
    performance evincing profound research in which he strongly recommends his favourite
    idea of gradually bringing human nature to a state of perfection by considering
    what man has been now is and may be this treatise will no doubt be viewed by some
    as rather fanciful but it is clearly the effort of a superior genius and must
    be peculiarly interesting when it is known that it was composed while its author
    was in circumstances of danger and distress  he idea of mans progressive advancement
    towards perfection and happiness inspired him with consolation under his complicated
    misfortunes although he was an enemy to revealed religion he was certainly a man
    of virtue and integrity yet all his philosophy could never inspire him with that
    heroic fortitude and contempt of death in a just cause for which the sincere votaries
    of christianity have ever been conspicuous an uniform edition of the works of

    very few banks with less than six partners in scotland almost all the great jointstock
    banks have numerous branches so that there is hardly a town or village of any
    consequence without two or more banks the bank of scotland began to issue onepound
    notes as early as  and their issue has since been continued without interruption
    with only one exception all the scotch banks issue notes  and taking their aggregate
    circulation at from l to l it is supposed that from l to l consists of notes for

    the measure having been strongly objected to by the people of scotland as being
    at once oppressive and unnecessary was abandoned asons there have been very few
    bankruptcies amongst the r the few scotch banks this superior stability is to
    be ascribed to lures a var i et y  f cause s  partly to the great wealth of the
    early established banks which had a considerable influence in preventing an inferior
    class of banks acquiring any hold on the public confidence  partly to the comparatively
    little risk attending the business of banking in scotland  partly to the facilities
    afforded by the scotch law for attaching a debtors property whether it consist
    of land or moveables  and partly and principally perhaps to the fact of the scotch
    banks being but indirectly and slightly affected by a depression of the exchange
    and an efflux of bullion the circumstances now mentioned render it unnecessary
    to enforce that suppression of local issues in scotland i long lotch inks ppressln
    of lo i notes i scotland  s  dispensable in england where the system of itoecesev
    oosits provincial banking is of a very inferior description the risk attending
    the business much greater and where any excess in the amount of the currency necessarily
    occasions a fall of the exchange and a demand for bullion the commerce and population
    of scotland are too limited and that country is too remote from the metropolis
    or from the centre of the monied world the pivot on which the exchanges turn to
    make it of importance that her currency should be identical with that of england
    we believe that the scotch attach much more importance than it deserves to the
    issue of paper and especially to the issue of onepound notes  still however we
    do not think that the circumstances are at present such as to call for or warrant
    any attempt to introduce any material changes in their banking system all the
    scotch banks receive deposits even of the low amount of l and allow interest on
    them at from one to two per cent below the market rate but should a deposit be
    unusually large as from l to ll a special agreement is usually made with regard
    to it this banks part of the system has been particularly advantageous it in fact
    renders the scotch banks a sort of savings banks for all classes  and their readily
    receiving all sorts of deposits at a reasonable rate of interest has tended to
    diffuse a spirit of economy and parsimony among the people that would not otherwise
    have existed the total deposits in the hands of the scotch banks are believed
    at present  to exceed l of which fully a half is understood to be in sums of from
    l to l the scotch banks make advances in the way of discashaccounts and loans
    and on what are called cashcredits or counts cashaccounts by the latter are meant
    credits given by the banks for specified sums to individuals each of whom gives
    a bond for the sum in his account with two or more individuals as sureties for
    its payment persons haying such accounts draw upon them for whatever sums within
    their amount they have occasion for repaying these advances as they find opportunity
    but generally within short periods interest is charged only on the average balance
    which may be found due to the bank the total number of these accounts in scotland
    in  was estimated at about  and it may now perhaps be taken at about   hey are
    relieved to average about l  few are for less than l and fewer still above l it
    has been contended and by no less an authority than adam smith that this species
    of accommodation gives the scotch merchants and traders a double command of capital  they
    may discount their bills of exchange says he  as easily as the english merchants
    and have besides the additional conveniency of their cashaccounts  but this is
    an obvious error the circulation will take off only a certain quantity of paper
    and to whatever extent it may be issued by means of cashaccounts so much the less
    can be issued in the way of discounts the advantage of a cashaccount does not
    really consist in its enabling a banker to enlarge his advances to his customers
    but in the extreme facility it affords of making them an individual who has obtained
    such an account may operate upon it at any time he pleases and by drafts for any
    amount an advantage he could not enjoy to any thing like the same extent without

    session there and two at some other scottish university  and thirdly they must

    some similar institutions of long standing little is known of its early history
    there was a grammarschool at glasgow in the early part of the fourteenth century
    it depended immediately on the cathedral church and the chancellor of the diocese
    had not only the appointment of the masters but also the superintendence of whatever
    related to education in the city the grammarschool continued to be a distinct
    establishment after the erection of the university and considerable care appears
    to have been taken to supply it with good teachers in  mr martin wan chancellor
    of the metropolitan church of glasgow brought a complaint before bishop blackadder
    against one dwne a priest of the diocese for teaching scholars in grammar and
    children in inferior branches by himself apart openly and publicly in the said
    city without the allowance and in opposition to the will of the chancellor the
    bishop having heard parties and examined witnesses decided with the advice of
    his chapter and of the rector and clerks of the university in favour of the chancellor
    in the sixteenth century the situation of the master of the grammarschool was
    highly respectable  he was to be found among the nonregentes nominated to elect
    the rector and to examine the graduates on the th of october  the presbytery directed
    the regents in the colkge  to try the irish scholars in the grammar school twitching

    the following abstract from dr hands annnla of nioc  lands annals of glasgow wall
    give the reader an idea of f extent of education in this city that indefatigable
    j  hor published the names of  teachers and from statement it appeared that exclusively
    of the univers  an d thirteen institutions where youth were educated  re were  schools
    that including the public institutions there were  scholars of whom  were taught
    glasg gratis in charity or free schools these schools were all in y a district
    containing about  souls  it appeared from the same statement that sunday schools
    were established in  that there were  schools  teachers and  scholars viz  boys
    and  girls besides three adult schools an infant school society was instituted
    in  in  there were six infant schools viz the model school in saltmarket a school
    in drygate chalmers street marlborough street john street and cowcaddens and two
    schoolhouses are about to be built in gorbals and one in anderston literaturefrom
    the commercial enterprise which engages the time and attention of its inhabitants
    this city cannot boast of a literary character there are many individuals however
    of cultivated minds and extensive attainments some of whom have formed themselves
    into societies for the promotion of literature and science about the middle of
    the last century a literary society was established consisting chiefly of the
    professors and clergymen of the city and neighbourhood and reckoned amongst its
    distinguished members doctors adam smith trail and reid and mr john millar the
    celebrated professor of law a literary and commercial society was formed about
    the beginning of the present century and is composed of a number of gentlemen
    who meet for the discussion of literary and commercial topics during the twentyseven
    years in which records have been kept upwards of two hundred essays have been
    read by the society the first newspaper published in the west of scotland was
    the glasgow courant which appeared in the year  it was published three times a
    week consisted of twelve pages in small quarto and was sold for three halfpence
    or  one penny to regular customers the second number contained a letter from provost
    aird colonel of the regiment of glasgow volunteers detailing his views in regard
    to the duke of argylls ultimate success at sheriffmuir the name of the paper was
    soon changed to that of the westcountry intelligencer which only survived a few
    years from  till the present time there have been twentyone attempts to establish
    newspapers in this city and out of that number eleven still survive the names
    of the papers the dates of their commencement and the periods of publication are
    as followsthe glasgow courant in  the journal in  the chronicle in  the mercury
    in  the advertiser in  but in  its name was changed to that of the herald the
    courier in  the clyde commercial advertiser in  the caledonia in  but in the same
    year it merged in the western star  the sentinel in   a second chronicle in  the
    scotsman in  the packet in  a second sentinel in  the free press in  the scots
    times in  the evening post in  the trades advocate in  the liberator in  the scottish
    guardian and the argus in  and the weekly reporter in  the eleven surviving papers
    are the journal published once a week the herald twice  the courier three times
    the chronicle three times the free press twice the scots times twice the evening
    post once  the liberator once the scottish guardian twice the argus twice and
    the weekly reporter once so that in glasgow there are twenty newspapers published
    weekly it would be invidious to state the circulation of each paper even if it
    could be accurately obtained it is however known that the circulation of the herald
    on each publishing day for some years past has rather exceeded eighteen hundred
    and that during w rjfi ert sinclair of stevenson had a grant from king william

    sent him to redepartment and patrick the edinburgh pair mr watt thought it capable
    of improvement and although the origin of stereotyping is uncertain it is having

    of stereotyping to a very great extent steamengines as applicable to manufacturesas
    the great improvement on the steamengine was made in glasgow a brief account of
    that mighty engine may not be improper here the steamengine was invented in the
    reign of charles ii by the marquis of worcester who in buck of carron iron works
    when he left glasgow for kinneil house near these works where he constructed a
    small steamengine the cylinder was of blocktin eighteen inches diameter the first
    experiment which was made at a coal mine succeeded to admiration indeed his success
    was so great that he procured a patent  for saving steam and fuel in fireengines
    dr roebucks affairs becoming embarrassed in  mr watt formed a connection with
    mr boulton of soho birmingham where they had the exclusive privilege of making
    steamengines for a period of twentyfive years on the expiration of the exclusive
    privilege the engineers of this city commenced making steamengines and to such
    an extent is this business carried on here that there are now thirteen firms who
    make steamengines or mill the year  published a book entitled a century of inmachinery
    some of the works are more like national ventions but as the marquis though notable
    as a theorethan private undertakings three houses alone employ tical projector
    knew little of practical detail captain saupwards of a thousand persons in this
    important branch vary took up the subject and published a book in  of trade   entitled
    the miners friend where he described the dr cleland has ascertained that in glasgow
    and its subprinciples of his improvement for which he obtained a urbs there are
    thirtyone diffeient kinds ot manufactures patent about this time papin a frenchman
    came to where steamengines are used and that in these and in england and becoming
    familiar with the elastic power of collieries quarries and steamboats there are  steamsteam
    he was on his return home employed by charles engines   horse power  average power
    of engines landgrave of hesse to raise water by a machine which he constructed
    and from this his countrymen affected to consider him as the inventor of the steamengine
    in  the doctor published an account of his inventions not long after this mr amonton
    contrived a machine which he called a firewheel it consisted of a number of buckets
    placed in the circumference of the wheel and communicating with each other by
    very circuitous passages one part of the circumference w r as exposed to the heat
    of a furnace and another to a stream or cistern of cold water at the death of
    amonton m dessandes a member of the way and was pressed between two cylinders
    whence he academy of sciences at paris presented to the academy a bobbin drew

    force of the first mill for spinning cotton was erected in birmingham rather more
    than  horses each the cotton tradethe manufacture of linens lawns cambrics and
    other articles of similar fabric was introduced into glasgow about the year  and
    continued to be the staple manufacture till they were succeeded by muslins the
    following is a brief account of that important event about the year  the late

    machinery the wool had to be carded in the common ention tnat it buppitiiiicu

  text: aristotles jvi ical pression is a continuation of the same physical notion
    ppjsounder which bis theory of the chief good is represented xhe soul of man is
    conceived to be wrought to a temperament or mean state all its affections and
    actions being in their due proportions to determine however this due measure of
    the affections or this mean to which the constitution of the soul must be brought
    in order to the virtuous character is the great question of ethics to what arbitration
    shall we resort to fix the evanescent boundaries of the territory of virtue  now
    the instances in which this selfmoderation belonging to the character of virtue
    is observed become in themselves the objects of approbation exciting in us sentiments
    of love esteem admiration honour and commending themselves at the same time to
    our intellectual perceptions hence the various expressions introduced into moral
    philosophy of moral fitness propriety proportionthe decent the fair the honourable
    the amiable in conduct the adoption of one or more of which tests of the morality
    of actions has given its peculiar shade of opinion to different systems aristotle
    contemplates these sentiments of approbation not as they are in themselves but
    as they are outwardly evidenced by the praises of mankind at large accompanying
    certain actions  it is clear that men praise some actions and censure others here
    then is a conclusive evidence of the moral nature of actions where mennot any
    particular society of men but the wide society of mankindare unanimous in praising
    any action  there the quality of praiseworthiness may be imputed to the action
    itself or the action is not only  good in being the attainment of some natural
    end but is further in itself the object of approbation the combination of these
    two effects is expressed by aristotle under the term zaxov  to which we have no
    perfect counterpart in our language though the word  honourable if understood
    in its full meaning may sufficiently represent it aristotles classification of
    actions under the heads of different virtues is founded on this analysis of the
    moral nature of actions a distinct class of natural objects of desire to the pursuit
    of which within certain limits praise is attached is in his system the ground
    of a distinct virtue his enumeration of the virtues is evidently incomplete it
    seems chiefly intended as an evidence by induction of that moderation of the affections
    in which he had stated the nature of virtue to consist his division indeed of
    virtue is physical rather than logicalan enumeration of the parts of virtue rather
    than of the kinds of it and his method accordingly did not require of him an exact
    statement of all the particulars comprized under the general term virtue he has
    been accused of attending chiefly to the more splendid virtues he was very probably
    led by the very criterion of virtue which he employed as well as by his view of
    the connection between ethics and politics to sketch more prominently those particular
    virtues which recommend a man in society and thus he has drawn beautiful little
    outlines of those charms of familiar intercourseaffability frankness agreeableness  his
    introduction indeed of these qualities among the virtues of his system is a striking
    evidence of the philosophy  practical nature of that virtue which he inculcates
    it is practical a virtue wdiich is not to be forgotten in any part of a mans philosodaily
    life whilst it nerves his arm in dangers distriph y  butes his bounty shields
    him against temptations of pleasure it unbends him in the hours of leisure and
    is ever on his tongue whether gravely pronouncing in his assertions and judgments
    or playing in the sallies of his wit these very instances show that he did not
    regard splendour as the exclusive attribute of virtue on the contrary he expressly
    speaks of it as only the heightening and decoration of the several virtues and
    as meritorious because it presupposes all the virtues in their perfection  another
    evidence of his not being exclusive in his regard to the more showy virtues is
    his treating of gentleness  he selects the virtue of justice  for more particular
    discussion he distinguishes it as a particular virtue from the whole of virtue
    which it denotes reaftwiin its being the moderation of the love of gain or selfinterest
    seduced however by the example of plato he departs in his mode of treating this
    virtue from the strict province of ethics into that of politics the justice which
    he explains is a political virtue applicable to the citizens of a common state
    rather than to man as man and this confusion of ethical and political justice
    has led him into a speculative refinement which gives the appearance of a forced
    effort to reconcile the notion of justice with his theory of virtue looking at
    justice as a dispensing power he observed that it was concerned about  a mean
    in things themselves apportioning to each person his exact due whether of reward
    or punishment on the ground of this fact he points out that justice is not  a
    mean as the other virtues are but is  of the meannot in itself  a relative mean
    but  relative to a mean had he considered justice solely as a moral habit he would
    have seen that the distinction was unnecessary since in this point of view it
    conforms precisely to his general notion of virtue in being a principle of selfmoderation
    there is however a foundation for the remark in the circumstance that justice
    admits of greater exactness in its exercise than other virtues  the rules of justice
    says an excellent writer   may be compared to the rules of grammar the rules of
    the other virtues to the rules which critics lay down for the attainment of what
    is sublime and elegant in composition in the other virtues we are thrown more
    on our sense of propriety in forming our practical decisions in justice we have
    evident facts before usthe merit or demerit of individuals in themselves and these
    form an external standard to guide us in our conduct over and above our internal
    convictions of right so far then justice may be regarded as  of the mean besides
    being also a point of propriety or a mean within ourselves aristotle it should
    be observed had no other more appropriate word distinct from  justice to express  honesty
    or  integrity and consequently was led to generalize too far in his analysis of
    justice aristotles discussion of friendship  is open to similar objection he has
    considered it in its outward effects as a social principle akin to justice to
    which justice is subordinate and supplementary rather than as an internal ethical

    of the heavens sect i of the celestial sphere when a spectator on a clear evening
    directs his attention to the sky he perceives a concave hemisphere studded with
    innumerable brilliant points all which appear to move in parallel directions constantly
    preserving the same distances and relative positions new groups of stars incessantly
    follow one another rising in the east mounting to a certain height and then gradually
    sinking till they disappear in the west on turning his face towards the north
    he observes some groups of stars which remain visible during the whole night wheeling
    round a certain fixed point and describing circles of greater or less magnitude
    according as they are at a greater or less distance from that point the same phenomena
    are observed every successive night and as the stars present always the same configurations
    and succeed each other in the same order the mind is irresistibly led to the hypothesis
    of the diurnal revolution of the whole heavens about a fixed axis this hypothesis
    implies that the stars move in parallel planes and that their mutual distances
    remain invariable in order however to be assured that such is the case it is necessary
    to have recourse to more accurate observations and to refer their successive positions
    to something that is fixedto certain points or planes which do not participate
    in the general motion horizon what is most obviously adapted for this purpose
    is the horizon or the plane which appears extended all round us and bounded by
    a circle of which the eye of the spectator occupies the centre let the circle
    senw fig plate  represent the horizon c being the centre or place of lxxix the
    observer suppose now that a star is observed to rise eigl a t a certain point
    of the horizon a and after tracing its circuit in the sky to set at the point
    a suppose also that another star rises at b and sets at b then if the distances
    ab ab are measured by means of some angular instrument it will be found that ab
    is equal to ab and that this is the case with regard to any two stars whatever
    since therefore the arcs ab and ab are equal it follows that the chords a a b
    b joining their extremities are parallel whence we infer that if two stars rise
    successively at the same point of the horizon a they will also set at the same
    point a a circumstance which is of itself strikingly indicative of the uniformity
    of the motion of the celestial bodies through c let a perpendicular be drawn to
    the chord cardinal a a meeting the boundary of the horizon in s and n points these
    two points are the south and north points of the horizon  and another straight
    line drawn through c parallel to a a will meet the horizon in e and w the east
    and west points the four together namely s e n w are called the four cardinal
    points of the horizon the horizontal circle is itself denominated the azimuth
    cirazimuth cle azimuth distances are measured from the north and south points
    so that s a is the azimuth distance of a stars rising at a and s a is that of
    its setting at a the complement of the azimuth or its defect from a right angle
    is called the amplitude which is consequently meaamplisured from the east and
    west points thus the arc eatude is the amplitude of a stars rising at a or its
    ortive amplitude and wa is that of its setting or its occasive amplitude conceive
    a straight line to pass through c perpendicular to the horizon this line which
    is called the vertical will meet the visible hemisphere in a point directly above
    the observer which is denominated the zenith the zenith point diametrically opposite
    in which the prolongation of  the vertical meets the invisible hemisphere is the
    nadir nadir the plane determined by the vertical and the straight line ns is called
    the meridian because when the sunmendar reaches it he is equally distant from
    the points at which he rises and sets or it is midday the great circle formed
    by the intersection of the meridian with fhe celestial sphere is the meridional
    circle it divides the sphere into the eastern and western hemispheres any circle
    passing through the zenith and nadir is called a vertical circle  that which intersects
    the meridional cire cl  cle at right angles or which passes through the points
    e and w is called the prime vertical let hpzh fig  represent a meridional circle

    size mr hume then informs him that lord shelburne and lord bute were amongst his
    most zealous partisans the last declaring the book one of the best he had ever
    read charles townshend appears to have been of the same opinion as he read it
    five times general clerk had pressed the author to dedicate his work to lord shelburne
    who had signified his intention of offering mr ferguson the government of west
    florida  upon which occasion his lordship laughed very heartily when the general
    expressed his conviction that mr ferguson was more usefully employed as a teacher
    of science the book however appeared without any dedication in the course of the
    following year lord shelburne intimated a hope of getting mr ferguson established
    with a proper appointment at oxford  and some other persons of influence meditated
    a design of employing him in one of the departments of state this purpose was
    frustrated in all probability by a temper which did not permit him to accommodate
    himself to the views of those whose maxims of conduct he did not entirely approve
    another circumstance may be considered as having also operated to obstruct the
    fulfilment of the schemes which were devised for his advancement at this time
    he married miss burnet a young lady nearly connected with his mothers family and
    still more nearly related to his intimate friend dr black soon afterwards he began
    to cultivate a farm in the parish of currie and at a considerable sacrifice of
    private interest gratified his taste for improvement by transforming a barren
    heath into a scene which became distinguished for beauty and fertility it was
    impossible however for any combination of circumstances to abate his literary
    activity and he not only continued to conduct the business of his class with unremitted
    diligence but seized every interval of leisure which he could command to collect
    materials for a history of the roman commonwealth whilst he was proceeding in
    his researches he was solicited by philip earl of stanhope the editor of dr robert
    simsons posthumous works and the other guardians of charles earl of chesterfield
    to superintend the education of that young nobleman then in his nineteenth year
    the negotiation was conducted through the mediation of dr adam smith who judging
    the offer to be advantageous to his friend exerted himself with great earnestness
    to induce him to accept it lord stanhope was extremely anxious to obtain the able
    services of dr ferguson without delay as he conceived it to be of the utmost consequence
    to his young kinsman to be placed under the care of  a person so well qualified
    to complete the remaining part of his education and to repair the neglects omissions
    and errors which had unfortunately been committed in the former part of it the
    proposal had originally been made early in the year  and was renewed in december
    soon after the commencement of the session of the college when dr ferguson was
    engaged not only in teaching his own class but also in lecturing on natural philosophy
    the professorship of which had recently become vacant by the death of his relation
    mr russell fie was not able to prevail on the patronsfw to accept of a substitute
    to complete the labours of that session  but after obtaining leave of absence
    for the next session he joined his young charge at geneva in may  and at first
    entertained hopes that his labours might prove beneficial the connection however
    was not so agreeable as he expected and it terminated about twelve months afterwards
    in the mean time he had very nearly been deprived of his office in the university
    the towncouncil had at his desire appointed mr john bruce then assistant and afterwards
    successor to mr stevenson to teach the moral philosophy during the session  but
    before the conclusion of the session they thought fit to rescind this act and
    to declare the office vacant his friends in the university particularly drs robertson
    blair and black were exceedingly indignant at this proceeding more especially
    as sir john pringle had been permitted to be several years absent and at that
    very time the professors of mathematics and of the theory of medicine had both
    been allowed to discharge their duty by substitutes for two years without challenge
    or complaint as the council however seemed to have determined to fill up the place
    by a new election it became necessary for his friends to apply to the court of
    session to put a stop to their proceedings  i have been much obliged says he in
    a letter to a friend  to the general voice that was raised in my favour as well
    as to the ardent zeal of particular friends hay campbell afterwards lord president
    has given me proofs of friendship which i can never forget pulteney has behaved
    to me in every thing as he would have done at the beginning of the poker club
    i have always been an advocate for mankind and am a more determined one than ever
    the fools and knaves are no more than necessary to give others something to do
    after his return he continued as formerly to divide his time between his literary
    and agricultural pursuits and engaged occasionally in the political controversies
    which agitated the country during the progress of the american war besides his
    pamphlet in answer to dr prices observations on liberty he communicated his views
    from time to time to sir william pulteney and other members of parliament and
    when it was resolved by government to send out commissioners to quiet the disorders
    in the colonies he was appointed secretary to the commission it appears from a
    letter of general putnam dated july  that the nomination of dr ferguson was very
    agreeable to the more intelligent part of the americans who not without reason
    were dissatisfied to find that the commissioners were fettered by restrictions
    which rendered their appointment nugatory  i am very sorry he writes  that the
    parliament of great britain is still so blind to their own and our interest as
    to send dr ferguson and the rest of the worthy gentlemen over to america with
    limited power and that to last only till july  and then to be revoked by them
    it they think fit by which means i am deprived of seeing your friend dr ferguson
    which gives me great pain as  always have heard of his being a gentleman of the
    first character lor learning good sense and humanity it is well known that the
    commissioners returned without accomplishing the object of their mission but they
    had an opportunity of acquiring more useful information of the state and temper
    of the country than government had received m a the previous course of the contest
    whilst dr ferguson was absent during the session  his place wassupplied by mr
    dugald stewart who about five years alterwards was destined to succeed him in
    the chair of mora philosophy in the year  he was seized with an attack of apoplexy
    which though not violent was nevertheless sufficient

    not in the slightest degree impair the force of his understanding  and so abstemious
    did he afterwards become as not only to secure himself against the recurrence
    of the disease but to enjoy almost uninterrupted health for more than thirty years
    as he could not now venture to lecture as formerly without the use of written
    notes he therefore found it necessary to write out a course of instruction to
    be read during the remainder of his incumbency in his endeavours to recover the
    substance of his lectures he availed himself of the notes taken by intelligent
    young men who had studied under him different sessions and who might thus be expected
    to have preserved the various modes in which he had stated his doctrines and the
    different arguments and illustrations by which he had happened to supply in one
    session what might have been omitted in another but in the prospect of soon relinquishing
    his office it was scarcely conceivable that the compilation which he thus executed
    could possess all the excellencies which he was capable of imparting to it more
    especially as he was now busy in carrying his great historical work through the
    press this was the history of the progress and termination of the roman republic
    in three volumes quarto published in  a book which not only delights by the clearness
    of its narrative and the boldness of its descriptions but instructs and animates
    by profound and masterly delineations of character as well as by the philosophical
    precision with which it traces the connection of events it is written in that
    tone of highminded enthusiasm which if it can only snatch from oblivion whatever
    is noble and generous in the record of human actions regards the graces of style
    as objects merely of secondary account and is chiefly studious of impressing the
    lessons of wisdom w hich may be gathered from the survey of distant ages  he fatigues
    and anxieties of public teaching now became oppressive to his spirits and not
    altogether favourable to his health  and he therefore deemed it expedient to resign
    his office in  when he had completed his sixtyfirst year mr dugald stewart then
    professor of mathematics succeeded to his office and in order to entitle dr ferguson
    to retain his salary he was conjoined in the professorship of mathematics with
    mr playfair he now proceeded to revise the notes of his lectures on ethics and
    politics with a view to publication and in  the work appeared under the title
    of principles of moral and political science though composed under disadvantageous
    circumstances and though he has omitted many of the questions which were treated
    in his elementary course it contains an admirable view of the systems both of
    ancient and modern philosophers particularly respecting the foundations of moral
    approbation and the sources of private happiness and public security the authors
    to whose suggestions he was most indebted w r ere xenophon plato and aristotle

    enjoy the conversation of intelligent friends  and his early prepossessions induced
    him to settle at st andrews here his strength gradually declined but the vigour

    interest in the great events which were then passing in the world or contemplated
    more anxiously the consequences of the arduous struggle in which his country was

    his age leaving three sons and three daughters in the various situations which
    it was his lot to occupy he had uniformly conducted himself with a dignity and

    accompanying the army on different expeditions one of the first of which was an

    fpment ottrohr rylnrod tho mnnonolv of fid  hal  jl  r  vo and sweet mackerel

    in like manner it is estimated that herrings might be supplied in any quantity
    at one halfpenny a piece and cod haddocks whitings flounders c proportionally
    cheap provided a steady demand was created as it is presumed there would be by
    the establishment of several regular markets in different parts of the metropolis
    another experiment of the committee shows how easily a demand for salted or corned
    fish might be created in the inland counties they contracted for  tons of corned
    cod caught and cured on our own coast and also for  corned herrings the former
    was supplied to the distressed manufacturers of sheffield at twopence halfpenny
    a pound and the latter at the rate of two for three halfpence here as well as
    in other parts of the country the poor it is stated received the fish distributed
    among them at low prices with the liveliest gratitude  and one gentleman in worcestershire
    states that  the herrings in particular have proved a bonus to the poor of the
    most essential benefit we sold them he says  at a very low and reasonable rate
    on account of the extreme indigence of the purchasers  and they have produced
    lao profit which after the expense of carriage is paid will be laid out in employing
    the poor in repairing the roads it deserves to be mentioned as an instance of
    the certainty of a supply to answer the demand that when the association was formed
    in  the north sea and iceland fishery had for some time entirely ceased but on
    the committee offering the fishermen l a ton for all the fish they should catch
    and cure they supplied in the first instance  tons of drysalted and fifty tons
    of fresh cod in the second  tons of drysalted and  tons of fresh  in the third  tons
    of drysalted and  tons of fresh in all  tons of fish w ere taken and brought to
    market in consequence of this offer not a fish of which would otherwise have been
    caught the obvious policy then to be pursued for extending the british fisheries
    is by creating an extended and constant demand in the foreign markets this can
    only be done by the care and attention bestowed in curing the fish so that in
    point of quality it may compete with those of the dutch and other nations of the
    continent a point which we have just now happily attained  but in the supply for
    home consumption every thing almost yet remains to be done the fish association
    have however clearly shown the way of proceeding to obtain this desirable end
    they have proved that not only in the metropolis but in the interior of the country
    the poor have none of those prejudices which were ascribed to them against the
    use of fish when it is fresh and sweet and when they are able to procure it at
    a moderate price a free circulation by means of markets established in the metropolis
    and at all the fishing ports might effect this to a certain degree but in addition
    to these some artificial expedients might be advisable for a time at least to
    raise and keep steady the demand it is much to be regretted that queen elizabeth
    who was well aware of the importance of the fisheries in a political as well as
    economical point of view did not in regulating the church ritual ordain two days
    in every week to be set apart by protestants as fish days which would have created
    a steady and permanent demand for fresh and salted fish in every part of the united
    kingdom such an ordinance might in her reign have been enforced and long habit
    would have reconciled people to the observance of those days in our times but
    it would be in  f sively placed the monopoly of fish in the hands of a few interested
    salesmen the establishment of that splendid and most commodious market the hungerford
    has put an end to that injurious monopoly and consequently reduced the prices
    and increased the quantity of this species of food for the use of the metropolis
    the encouragement given by the government in the shape of bounties appears to
    have contributed but little to the success of the fisheries if a branch of trade
    once fairly established will not support itself without being bolstered up by
    bounties it never can be worth carrying on bounties should only be continued for
    a definite time and decreased gradually those on the fisheries should be given
    on the quantity procured and the quality of those cured and not on the instrument
    of their production  on the fish and not on the vessel it was proved by a committee
    of the house of commons in  that the herring fishery absolutely cost little short
    of l annually which on an average of ten years was equal to l per cent on the
    value of all the fish that had been taken by the vessels on which it was paid
    adam smith has justly observed that a tonnagebounty proportioned to the burden
    of the ship and not to her diligence and success in the fishery is not the best
    stimulus to exertion  it was an encouragement for fitting out ships to catch not
    the fish but the bounty  or to induce rash adventurers to engage in concerns which
    they did not understand and cause them to lose by their ignorance more than was
    gained by the liberality of government the carelessness of such persons and the
    ignorance of those employed by them in curing and packing the fish not only robbed
    the public purse but destroyed the character of the article in the foreign market
    where if saleable at all it fetched only an inferior price whilst the skill and
    attention of the dutch secured for their fish that preference to which they were
    justly entitled the change of the bounty however from the tonnage to the quantity
    and the quality of the fish caught and cured with the regulations adopted by the
    acts of th and th geo iii have had the good effect of raising the character and
    consequently increasing the demand for british fish in the foieign markets where
    the herrings in particular are now held in equal estimation with those ot the
    dutch the bounty granted by the act  geo iii c  is s per barrel on all herrings
    branded by the proper officers and s a barrel granted by the act  geo iii c  and
    is so considerable that at this time it amounts to a sum not less than l a year
    it would appear however that all which is now wanting for the encouragement and
    extension of the british fisheries is a constant steady and increased demand in
    the home and foreign markets an experiment made by mr hale one of the members
    of the committee for the relief of the manufacturing poor proves decisively how
    easy it would be to introduce the general use of fish in the metropolis he agreed
    with some fishermen to take from ten to twenty thousand mackerel a day at a price
    not exceeding s the hundred of six score or at a penny a piece a price at which
    the fishermen said they could afford to supply the london jnarket to any extent
    provided they were sure of a regular sale on the th of june  upwards of  mackerel
    were sent to spitalfields and sold at the original c ost of a penny a piece to
    which place women were employed to carry them from billingsgate until eleven oclock

    abound in incidents or adventures  but it is tull of honour both for the individual
    and the studies to which he was devoted and may be read with more profit than
    many more ambitious histories  he was the eldest son of the reverend james  layiair
    minister of benvie in forfarshire in which place he was born on the th of march  tie
    resided at home under the domestic tuition of his father until the age of fourteen
    when he entered at the university of st andrews and was almost immediately distinguished
    not merely for his singular proficiency in mathematical learning but for the extent
    of his general knowledge the clearness of his judgment and the dignity and propriety
    of his conduct a remarkable testimony to this effect has been made public in an
    early letter of principal george hill who was at this time one of his fellowstudents
    and was himself so remarkable for early talent that we find it recorded of him
    that he had privately composed an excellent sermon in the tenth year of his age
    a youth of this description cannot be supposed to have been very indulgent in
    his estimate of the merits of his competitors  and it could therefore have been
    no ordinary measure of ability that called forth the following ingenuous avowal
    in a confidential letter to his mother   playfair has very great merit and more
    knowledge and a better judgment than any of his classfellows i make no exceptions  my
    parts might be more showy and the kind of reading to which my inclination led
    me was calculated to enable me to make a better figure at st andrews but in judgment
    and understanding i was greatly inferior to him  it isscarcely a stronger though
    undoubtedly a very different proof of his rare attainments that when the professor
    of natural philosophy wilkie the once celebrated author of the epigoniad w r as
    prevented by indisposition from delivering the regular lectures he used generally
    to delegate the task of instruction to his youthful pupil wilkie besides being
    a scholar and philosopher of no mean note was a man of primitive benevolence and
    integrity and of great vivacity in conversation and the friendship which in spite
    of the disparity of their years was speedily formed between him and young playfair
    speaks as much for the social and moral character of the latter as his substitution
    of him in the classroom does for his early proficiency in science on this last
    subject we shall mention but one fact more in  when only eighteen years of age
    he offered himself with the approbation of his instructors at st andrews as candidate
    for the professorship of mathematics in mareschal college aberdeen and sustained
    with the most distinguished credit an examination or comparative trial which lasted
    eleven days and embraced nearly the whole range of the exact sciences out of the
    six competitors who entered the lists against him two only were judged to have
    excelled him the reverend dr trail who was appointed to the office and dr hamilton
    who afterwards succeeded to and long filled it with much reputation in  he removed
    to edinburgh where his merit and modesty very soon introduced him to the friendship
    of dr robertson adam smith dr matthew stewart dr black and dr hutton  with all
    of whom he continued on terms playfair of the utmost cordiality during the whole
    period of their lives in  he was a candidate for the professorship of natural
    philosophy at st andrews vacant by the death of his friend dr wilkie there was
    no comparative trial on this occasion  and he was again unsuccessful under circumstances
    which have led one of the most dutiful sons of that university dr cook in his
    life of principal hill to remark  how much it suffered in thus losing a man by
    whose talents its reputation would have been so highly promoted in the course
    of the same year the death of his father suddenly devolved upon him the burden
    of supporting the family and admonished him no longer to delay the final election
    of a profession he had been educated with a view to the church and was every way
    qualified to accept a living on the establishment but his decided predilection
    for science had hitherto made him hesitate about engaging in a vocation the duties
    of which he felt if conscientiously discharged would necessarily interfere to
    a great extent with the studies he was loth to abandon in this emergency however
    he thought himself no longer entitled to indulge in those predilections and accordingly
    made application to lord gray the patron for a presentation to the livings of
    liff and benvie which had been filled by his father his lordship was too well
    aware of his merits to hesitate about conferring so great a benefit on the parishioners
    and immediately issued a presentation in his favour although from some challenge
    of his right to the patronage induction was not obtained until late in the year  from
    this period until  mr playfair w r as constantly resident at liff and occupied
    almost exclusively with the pastoral duties of his office in this retreat his
    leisure hours were dedicated to the education of his younger brothers and to a
    very close and intimate correspondence with mr robertson afterwards lord robertson
    the son of the illustrious historian to whom he seems to have confined the remarks
    that occurred to him upon the different authors he perused and the subjects of
    speculation which they suggested we cannot help hoping that some selection from
    this correspondence may one day be given to the public in the year  he contributed
    to the transactions of the royal society of london a paper on the arithmetic of
    impossible quantities which exhibits within a very small compass a striking example
    of the rare and admirable talent of detaching the sound spirit of science from
    what may be termed its mysticism and circumscribing by the most precise and luminous
    boundaries the vague and unlimited inquiries into which many mathematicians had
    been seduced by the nature of the instruments they employed in the year  he was
    induced by very advantageous offers to resign his charge and to superintend the
    education of mr ferguson of raith and his brother sir ronald an arrangement which
    restored him in a great measure to the literary and scientific society of edinburgh
    and enabled him to gratify himself by a personal introduction to several of the
    most eminent cultivators of science in london he had repeatedly visited dr maskelyne
    astronomer royal whilst that ingenious mathematician was busied in  in making
    a series of observations in perthshire on the attraction of mountains andwhilstsharingthe
    shelter of his tent on the side of schehallien contracted with him a cordial friendship
    which continued unbroken for the remainder of their lives under these honourable
    auspices he made his first appearance in london in  and was speedily introduced
    to all those in whom he was likely to take most interest he seems to have kept
    a pretty full and correct journal of all that he observed during this journey
    to the metropolis and a portion of it  dr cooks life of principal hill

  text: glasgow the cathedral and other churches educational institutions glasgow
    are not fewer than  roman catholics which reduces the protestants to  and that
    the sittings in the catholic chapels amount to only  there are three four and
    even six different services in each of these every sunday it would appear that
    there are  sittings provided in glasgow for her  protestant inhabitants the venerable
    cathedral now in a state of complete repair is acknowledged to be one of the best
    specimens of old english gothic it occupies a prominent position on the northeast
    side of the city and stands about  feet above the level of the clyde its form
    is that of a large cross with exceedingly short transepts its length from east
    to west is  feet its breadth  the height of the choir  and of the nave  feet at
    the intersection it has a tapering octagonal spire which rises to the height of  feet
    since the late removal of the galleries in the choir and of the modern stonework
    between the nave and the choir the cathedral is now seen in all its beautiful
    primeval condition in this edifice there are  pillars and  windows some of them
    of exquisite workmanship the crypt under the choir is scarcely equalled and certainly
    not surpassed anywhere for architectural effect st andrews as a modern church
    is one of the most elegant in the city it is situated in st andrews square and
    is nearly a facsimile of st martinsinthefields in london st davids in the gothic
    and st georges and st enochsin the roman stylebelonging to the establishment are
    handsome structures while the gothic edifices of st johns st matthews and others
    belonging to the free church are elegant in design and ornamented with lofty spires
    among the many churches belonging to the dissenters perhaps there is none more
    striking than the one in renfield street and none so beautiful as that lately
    built for the congregational body in the western line of bath street the spire
    of which is a model of perfection the catholics too in addition to their ornate
    gothic chapel in clyde street have lately added several ecclesiastical ornaments
    to the city the universitythis ancient and celebrated seminary of learning was
    founded by a bull of pope nicholas v in  it formed a corporate body consisting
    of a chancellor rector and dean with doctors masters regents and students in the
    several faculties into which it was divided one of these was known as the pedagogium
    or college of arts this school of learning was first situated in rotten row in  james
    lord hamilton bequeathed to the principal recent of that colleite some buildings
    and several acres of land on part of which the present structure was afterwards
    erected the college of arts was restored and endowed by james vi during the period
    which intervened between  and  the university underwent many changes but in the
    year  each of the scottish colleges having received a grant of l per annum out
    of the bishops rents the glasgow institution again revived  and having received
    other public and private gifts its progress has been since uninterrupted the academic
    body of the university consists at present of the chancellor the lord rector the
    dean of faculty the principal and vicechancellor twentytwo professors and one
    lecturer the whole business of the university is transacted in three distinct
    courts viz the senate the faculty and the comitia see universities the students
    are divided into togati and nontogati the former wear a gown of scarlet cloth
    and belong to the latin greek logic moral philosophy and natural philosophy classes
    the latter are unrestricted in their dress except the students of divinity there
    are bursaries connected with the college founded by thirty individuals held by
    upwards of sixty students from four to six years each the amount payable to each
    varies from l to l a few being worth l and one l in addition to these are the
    more valuable bursaries bequeathed by mr snell and the bishop of rochester the
    former afford l per annum for each of ten scottish students at baliol oxford and
    the latter l for each of four and which sum is generally bestowed in addition
    to four of the exhibitions under snells bequest the present buildings were principally
    erected in  and  the spire which is  feet in height is chiefly interesting from
    possessing a thunderrod which was reared under the auspices of franklin in  in
    the divinity and faculty halls are a few historical pictures and several portraits
    the university has had from its origin men of the highest glasgow talent and literary
    and scientific eminence among its pros  fessors and officebearers the names of
    melville baillie leishman burnet simpson hutchison black cullen adam smith reid
    millar richardson sandford and thomas thomson are conspicuous while the names
    of edmund burke sir james mtntosh h brougham jeffrey thomas campbell alison macaulay
    and other distinguished persons are to be found in the lists of lord rectors the
    library was commenced almost simultaneously with the foununiversity dation of
    the college and consists of upwards of  volumes library among which are some very
    rare and beautiful editions of the classics and several valuable mss the bibliomaniast
    may here see zacharias boyds metrical version of the bible and a splendid copy
    of the alexandrian version of the scriptures the library is supported from the
    interest of money left for this purpose and the fees of students but chiefly from
    the grant of upwards of l per annum which the college receives from the exchequer
    as an equivalent for the loss of the stationers hall privilege immediately behind
    the university buildings stands the hunterian hunterian museum a beautiful fabric
    erected in  from a design by starke museum the building exhibits six doric columns
    bearing a pure doric frieze and entablature and surmounted by a glass cupola it
    was reared for the reception of the magnificent collection of curiosities which
    the late dr william hunter bequeathed to the university where he was educated
    the contents of this valuable museum have been valued at l the medals alone are
    accounted worth l  and the library together with the rich collection of illuminated
    manuscripts have been estimated at little short of the same sum the naturalist
    will find here a beautiful collection of minerals shells quadrupeds birds insects
    and fossils the physiologist an apartment filled with the most curious anatomical
    preparations while the devotee of art will be gratified with some of the best
    specimens of rubens guido domenichino murillo correggio giordano n poussin zucherelli
    salvator rosa sneyders weenix wouvermans and reynolds immediately behind and surrounding
    the museum are the colcollege lege gardens set especially apart for the use of
    the students they gardens are planted with trees and ornamented with walks and
    shrubbery this spot may be said to have obtained a semiclassical notoriety from
    being the scene chosen by sir walter scott for the rencontre of rashleigh and
    francis osbaldistone in the romance of rob hoy andersons universitythis institution
    was founded by andersons mr john anderson professor of natural philosophy in the
    university university of glasgow in  and endowed by him with a valuable philosophical
    apparatus museum and library it is governed by  trustees and is intended as a
    means of bringing a literary and scientific education more within the reach of
    the mass of the community every branch of study taught in the college with the
    exception of divinity is given here drs garnett and birkbeck were the original
    professors of natural philosophy and chemistry  and it was here that the first
    mechanics class was established in great britain the number of students in the
    session  amounted to  being an increase since  of  the high school or grammarschool
    in john street high under the charge of the corporation is the oldest educascllo
    ltional institution in the city it appears a grammarschool existed in glasgow
    in the early part of the fourteenth century being then dependent on the cathedral
    church up to  its masters only taught latin and greek but at that period the school
    underwent a complete alteration two of the classical masterships were suppressed
    and in lieu of these teachers of english grammar foreign languages writing arithmetic
    geography mathematics and drawing were introduced the name was also changed from
    the grammar to the high school the mechanics institution which was founded in  themechaformore
    effectually diffusing science among the workingnics f nstl  classes is situated
    in hanover street lectures are here given on chemistry natural philosophy and
    popular anatomy while teachers give instruction in english grammar and composition
    drawing and music attached to the institution are a readingroom and library the
    latter containing upwards of  volumes tution

  text: glasgow normal and other schools literary and scientific institutions newspapers
    and libraries g l a s g  w  there are two normal schools for the training of teachers
    the one under the control of the established and the other under that of the free
    church there has also been established an excellent school of design which is
    well attended while during the last few years several educational institutions
    of a semipublic semiprivate kind have been formed chiefly in the western parts
    of the town for the instruction of the children of both sexes of the higher classes
    the number of elementary schools is very great and daily increasing according
    to dr strangs tables the education statistics of glasgow at the census of  were
    as follows number of weekday schools  number of evening schools  day scholars
    on books  day scholars attending st march   evening scholars adults attending  total
    day and evening scholars attending being  out of a population of  at  and under  years
    of age and  at  and under  years of age these figures however do not express the
    precise educational destitution the number between  and  years of age being estimated
    at about  or   and although the number in this last category has of late years
    been gradually reducing through the increased zeal of ecclesiastical educationalists
    as well as the benevolence of general philanthropists still there is left a wide
    field of ignorance to cultivate and which it is feared can only be reclaimed by
    some governmental and unsectarian system of tuition one of the most striking facts
    connected with the educational statistics of glasgow is that in  there were  sabbath
    schools which were attended by  young persons although glasgow can boast of having
    had many learned and able men at various times born or resident within its borders
    still its inhabitants cannot lay claim to having much of a literary character
    about the middle of last century a literary society was established consisting
    chiefly of the professors and clergy of the city and neighbourhood and reckoned
    amongst its distinguished members professors simson adam smith traill reid john
    millar and the messrs foulis the celebrated printers another literary and commercial
    society was also formed about the beginning of the present century in which drs
    chalmers and wardlaw and other able men took an interest and where essays are
    still read and discussions take place on the literary commercial statistical and
    political topics of the day a philosophical society was also established in  which
    uniting as it now does the man of science with the practical chemist and mechanic
    forms a most effective nucleus for mutual encouragement and advancement in  a
    society for promoting astronomy was formed which in due time erected an observatory

    about two miles west of the city where it now stands it is occupied and conducted
    by the professor of astronomy in the university in addition to an antiquarian
    society there is the maitland club an institution similar to the bannatyne of
    edinburgh for the printing of curious and rare manuscripts illustrative of the
    history literature or antiquities of scotland nearly  quarto volumes have been
    already printed by this brotherhood there are  newspapers and mercantile lists
    published in glasgow irrespective of a host of penny papers which the altered
    state of the law has produced some of which have a very large circulation the
    first newspaper published in the west of scotland was the glasgow courant which
    appeared in the year  since which time many have been established and disappeared
    the first circulating library was established in glasgow in  and lent out books
    at one halfpenny per volume at present there are many circulating as well as public
    and private libraries we have already alluded to that of the college and we may
    now mention those belonging to anderglasgow sons university to the faculties of
    physicians and surgeons and procurators the philosophical society and also to
    those founded by mr stirling and established under the title of the glasgow public
    library in consequence of an invitation from the magistrates letterpress george
    anderson was induced to come to glasgow in  printing and here printed an account
    of the celebrated assembly of the church of scotland which met in that year the
    printing of books however does not appear to have succeeded well until the messrs
    foulis commenced in  after which and during a succession of years they sent forth
    from their press works and particularly editions of the classics which for accuracy
    and beauty have never been surpassed in great britain letterpress printing is
    now carried on to a very great extent besides the great number of newspaper printing
    offices many of which have steampresses the printing of books is pursued with
    great vigour and to a considerable extent the corporationfrom the period when

  text: a g r agrarian agrarian laws leges agrarice when used in the most extended
    signification of the term are laws for the distribution and regulation of property
    in land the history of these enactments is not only important as explanatory of
    the constitution of the ancient republics but is rendered highly interesting by
    the conflicting opinions which have been entertained respecting their object and
    operation it seems to have been a notion generally entertained in the ancient
    world that every citizen of a country should be a landholder and that the territory
    of a state so far as it was not left uninclosed or reserved for public purposes
    should be divided in equal portions among the citizens such a distribution of
    public land seems to have been acted upon as a recognised principle from the earliest
    period to which existing historical records extend hence we find the almighty
    giving express instructions to moses as to the manner in which the land of canaan
    was to be portioned out among the hebrews num xxxiii  and naming the persons to
    whom the division was to be entrusted num xxxiv  a division of the land was accordingly
    made and the portion assigned to each man became his inalienable property and
    descended in perpetuity to his heirs and successors by the law of jubilee all
    lands were re stored free from encumbrances on the recurrence of the  year of
    releaseso that though a mans estate might in the interval have been repeatedly
    sold or alienated yet on the return of the fiftieth year it reverted to the heirs
    of the original possessor levit xxv  in the republics of ancient greece and also
    in the grecian colonies a similar principle of division of land prevailed thuc
    v  herod iv  lycurgus is represented by plutarch lycur as redividing the whole
    territory of laconia into  parcels of which  were assigned in equal lots to as
    many spartan families and  also in equal lots to their free subjects  and although
    this statement is not borne out by any of the early greek historians and is even
    inconsistent with the assertion of aristotle polit ii  yet it is valuable as recognising
    the principle of the division of the public lands see thirlwalls hist of greece
    chap viii and grotes hist of greece part ii chap vi with the authorities there
    quoted it was long a prevalent and undisputed opinion that the territories of
    the hebrews and of the republics of ancient greece were divided into equal portions
    and that the object of such a distribution was to maintain a state of equality
    among all the members of the community this however does not appear to be consistent
    with the distinctions of rank which we find admitted in scripture josh ix   xxii   sam
    ix  c c and from a remark of thucydides i  taken in connection with the statement
    of aristotle polit ii  it may be legitimately inferred that property did not continue
    to be equally distributed at lacedaemon distinctions of rank are clearly recognised
    in the legislation of solon aristotle in the second book of his politics chap
    vi c explains the constitutions of several of the ancient republics and endeavours
    to show how the population is to be accommodated to this equal division of land
    but it would be foreign to our object to review his arguments it may be sufficient
    to remark that such an attempt to arrest the progress of enterprise is altogether
    inconsistent with the spirit of liberty which gave life and energy to the ancient
    republics  and that though it might have been carried into effect under the despotism
    of persia or the predominant rule of the kings of macedonia it was entirely at
    variance with the freedom of opinion which prevailed in greece and the stubborn
    resistance to control which animated the romans after the expulsion of the kings
    but granting that such a policy had been practicable it would have been highly
    inexpedient the ignorant hindoo might remain satisfied with the class which nature
    had transmita g r  ted to him through successive generations because his proagrarian
    genitors had been prevented from emerging from their ob scurity but the citizens
    of greece and italy being themselves constituent members of the body politic and
    not ignorant of the power thereby conferred on them could not have been kept in
    check by the same principle of fear such an attempt moreover to prevent the acquisition
    of property would have obstructed the advancement of the arts of civilised life
    would have extinguished those feelings of patriotism which led the greeks so often
    to hazard their lives in defence of their country and by engendering discontent
    and exciting internal commotions would have made them an easy prey to their enemies
    the expression agrarian laws however is more commonly applied to the enactments
    among the romans for the management of the public domains ager publicus  and to
    an account of these the remainder of our space must be devoted it is a singular
    fact that while almost every other subject connected with the roman constitution
    had been successfully investigated and explained the object and intention of the
    agrarian laws were entirely misunderstood by scholars for many centuries after
    the revival of letters they were invariably represented as intended to prohibit
    roman citizens from holding property in land above a certain fixed amount and
    as authorising the division among the poorer citizens of the estates of private
    individuals when these exceeded the prescribed limit thus legalising a system
    of plunder which would have been subversive of all social order no such doctrine
    had indeed been admitted in any wellregulated state ancient or modern  nor did
    anything analogous to it appear in the principles or practice of the roman constitution  yet
    the expressions used by the ancient authors in reference to these enactments and
    the disturbances to which they invariably gave rise seemed to justify an unfavourable
    interpretation  and the opinion when once propounded was unconditionally received
    by successive generations of learned men notwithstanding the many embarrassments
    and contradictions to which it led romulus is represented as dividing his small
    territory among the members of his infant community at the rate of two jug era
    each extending to twothirds of an english acre apiece as inheritable property
    the whole district however was not thus assigned one portion was set apart for
    the service of the gods and for the royal domains and another was reserved as
    common land for pasture the stock kept on the common land served to eke out a
    maintenance which two jugera could not otherwise have furnished to a family and
    an agistment was paid to the commonwealth for the pasturage it is probable that
    the same principle prevailed under the regal government and that successive adjustments
    of the territory were made such a law existed among those of servius tullius the
    equality of property thus established seems to have been considered as a fundamental
    principle of the roman constitution and the agrarian laws were regarded as the
    necessary means of wresting from the large proprietors the possessions which they
    had illegally acquired machiavelli and montesquieu both participate in this mistake
    and are far from condemning the agrarian laws even when taken in the common meaning
    the former alleges that the interest of every republic requires that the state
    should be rich and the citizens poor and thus justifies the assumed spoliation
    while montesquieu receives it as an historical fact that romulus adopted the principle
    of equality in his original distribution of the territory of rome as the future
    ground of her strength  and that the tribunitian contests were but attempts to
    restore the original constitution adam smith wealth of nations b iv chap vii part
    i assents to the same interpretation without however any expression of approval

  text: money  money glaucus cost a hundred  the etymology of the latin word pecunia
    signifying money and of all its derivatives would seem to prove that cattle pecus
    had been the primitive money of the romans  and that they had been used as such
    by the ancient germans is obvious  for their laws uniformly fix the amount of
    the penalties to be paid for offences in cattle  in remoter ages corn was very
    generally used in agricultural countries as money and even now nothing is more
    common than to stipulate for corn rents and wages other articles have been used
    in other countries salt is said to be the common money of abyssinia  cowries a
    species of shells gathered on the shores of the maidive islands are used in smaller
    payments throughout hindostan and form the only money of extensive districts in
    africa  dried fish serves as money in iceland and newfoundland   and adam smith
    mentions that at the period of the publication of the wealth of nations  it was
    customary in a village in scotland for workmen to carry nails as money to the
    bakers shop and the alehouse  defects of j u  these articles universally want
    some of the prinmodities   p ro p eres which money ought to possess products must
    frequently be brought to market which are worth only part of an ox and part of
    a skin  but as an ox could not be divided and as the division of a skin would
    most probably deprive it of part of its value they could not be exchanged for
    such money divisibility is not however the only indispensable quality in a commodity
    used as a medium of exchange it is farther necessary that it should admit of being
    kept for an indefinite period without deteriorating  that it should by possessing
    great value in small bulk be easily carried about and that one piece of money
    of a certain weight and fineness should be precisely equivalent to every other
    piece of money of the same weight and fineness but none of the commodities specified
    above as having been used as money possesses these properties though cattle had
    been sufficiently divisible they could neither be preserved nor transported from
    place to place without a great deal of trouble and expense while owing to the
    difference in their qualities one ox of a superior might be worth two or three
    oxen of an inferior variety it is plain therefore that they could not serve as
    money except in a very rude state of society when the arts were almost unknown
    and the rearing of cattle formed the principal employment corn is sufficiently
    divisible  but its bulk is far too great in proportion to its value to admit of
    its easy transportation and it also is of very different and not easily appreciated
    qualities salt shells and fish are all open to insuperable objections equal quantities
    of all of them differ very greatly in their values  some of them cannot be divided
    and others cannot be preserved or transported without much loss these commodities
    were also deficient in a still more important particular their value was not sufficiently
    money invariable to permit of their being advantageously used as money they were
    not durable or lasting nor was it possible to adjust their supply so as to avoid
    sudden fluctuations of price the occasional abundance and scarcity of pasture
    has a powerful influence over the price of cattle which is still more seriously
    affected by the occurrence of epidemical diseases and other contingencies the
    fluctuations in the price of corn arising from variations of the seasons are too
    frequent and obvious to require to be pointed out and in the islands where cowries
    are picked up a strong gale from a particular point of the compass has frequently
    in a few hours sunk their value considerably it was not therefore to be expected
    that such commodities should be either generally or permanently used as money
    in civilised societies parties would very frequently be unwilling to buy or barter
    produce for articles which might in a few weeks or even days lose a third or a
    half of their value the desire of uniting the different qualities of invarigold
    and ability of value divisibility durability facility of transsilver the portation
    and perfect sameness doubtless formed the fittest ipairresistible reasons which
    have induced all civilised communities to employ gold and silver as money though
    far from invariable the value of these metals changes only by slow degrees they
    are readily divisible into any number of parts which may be reunited by means
    of fusion without loss they do not deteriorate by being kept their firm and compact
    texture makes them difficult to wear their cost of production especially of gold
    is so considerable that they possess great value in small bulk and can of course
    be transported with comparative facility and their identity is perfect the pure
    gold and silver supplied by russia and australia having precisely the same qualities
    with that furnished by california and peru no wonder therefore when almost every
    property necessary to constitute money is possessed in so eminent a degree by
    the precious metals that they have been used as such from a very remote tera their
    employment in this function is not ascribable to accident to the genius of any
    individual or to any peculiar combination of circumstances it grew naturally out
    of the wants and necessities of society on the one hand and the means of supplying
    them possessed by these metals on the other they became universal money as turgot
    has observed  not in consequence of any arbitrary agreement among men or of the
    intervention of any law but by the nature and force of things terials for money
    a considerable period must necessarily have elapsed i ntr j uc  after the introduction
    of the precious metals into comtion of gold merce before they were used generally

  text: 'moral philosophy  ketftude jl  following quod legislator prseceperit id pro
    bono quod vetuerit id pro malo habendum esse    ante imperia justum et injustum
    non extitere  ut quorum natura ad mandatum sit relativa actioque omnis sua natura
    adiaphora est quod justa vel injusta sit a jure imperantis provenit lieges igitur
    legitimi quae imperant justa faciunt imperando quae vetant vetando injusta privati
    autem homines dum cognitionem boni et mali ad se trahunt cupiunt esse sicut reges
    quod salva civitate non potest   culpa hoc est peccatum est quod quis fecerit
    omiserit dixerit vel voluerit contra rationem civitatis id est contra leges   in
    a state of nature nothing can be unjust the notions of right and wrong justice
    and injustice have there noplace where there is no common power there is no lawwhere
    no law no transgressions   no law can be unjust  many similar statements might
    be adduced from the two works from which these sentences are taken and such statements
    it cannot be denied if taken by themselves would fully justify the imputation
    to hobbes of the opinion that it is by the authority of political enactment that
    justice and injustice right and wrong are produced all however that he appears
    to have intended by them is that in a state the governing power must settle the
    conditions of property and by its enactment and not by the opinions of each individual
    must the duty and the right of each as a member of the body politic be determined
    that he did not consider his inquiry as directed to the settling of general principles
    of morals but only to the determining of the authority by which in a state the
    boundaries of good and evil should for governmental purposes be fixed and that
    he held moral distinctions to be in themselves independent of civil enactment
    may be clearly shown from many parts of his treatise de give thus in reference
    to theft he says  non queerimus an furtum sit peccatum  quccrimus quid furtum
    dicendum sit et sic de cuteris similibus  according to this his design is not
    to determine the moral virtues but only to ascertain by what authority such and
    such acts are to be held breaches of these virtues this obviously implies that
    these virtues themselves rest on something else than and anterior to civil enactment
    for their basis still more explicitly and fully is this stated in the following
    passage  doctrinarum quae ad seditionem disponunt una et prima haec est cognitionem
    de bono et malo pertinere ad singulos in statu quidem natural ubi jure aequali
    singuli vivunt nec se per pacta sua aliorum imperio submiserunt veram earn esse
    concedimus imo cap i art  probavimus sed in statu civili falsa est ostensum enim
    est cap yi art  regulas boni et mali justi et injusti honesti et inhonesti esse
    leges civiles ideoque quod legislator praeceperit id pro bono quod vetuerit et
    pro malo habendum esse  here the author distinctly states that in a state of nature
    every man can and may judge for himself what is right or wrong and that it is
    only when he has entered into a civil compact that he becomes bound to allow the
    state to fix the rules of rectitude for him such a doctiine may be very unsound
    politically but it does not amount to anything like an affirmation that moral
    distinctions as such have their origin in civil enactment on the contrary in that
    part of his work to which he here refers the first chapter hobbes shows at length
    that there are natural laws prescribing to man what he ought to do that these
    laws are immutable and eternal that they bind man inforo rectitude conscientice
    that they are nothing else than certain conelusions understood by reason concerning
    things to be done and things to be omitted that they are identical with the moral
    law  and that they may justly be called divine  not only because reason which
    is itself the law of nature has been given immediately by god to each man as the
    rule of his actions but also because the precepts of living thence derived are
    the same as those which have been promulgated by the divine majesty as laws of
    the heavenly kingdom through our lord jesus christ and the holy prophets and apostles  these
    sentiments appear altogether incompatible with the theory of moral distinctions
    usually imputed to hobbes it belongs to another department to examine the soundness
    of hobbess doctrine concerning the relation of subjects to their governors the
    opinion which has been thus injuriously imputed to hobbes was certainly however
    held by some ancient philosophers as cudworth has showed in his learned way by
    numerous citations  unfortunately these are for the most part given in such a
    way that we have been unable to verify them all and of those we have succeeded
    in tracing all do not appear apposite to the purpose for which they are cited
    when every deduction however has been made on these accounts there still remains
    enough to prove that there were philosophers in ancient times who not only affirmed
    what hobbes has affirmed as to justice and injustice good and evil being determined
    by law but who affirmed also what hobbes has denied viz that such distinctions
    are not also by nature  now to all such doctrines the answer is sufficiently obvious
    a law as law is the mere expression of the supreme will in a community and can
    never confer a moral character on any act to which it relates the utmost law can
    do is to indicate that a given course will be followed by a given punishment and
    so to affix a character of imprudence or folly to the pursuing of that course
    it can never per se make that which was before right to become wrong nor that
    which was before wrong to become right  a sovereign as has been truly said  may
    enact and rescind laws but he cannot create or rescind a single virtue nor can
    any mere expression of his will or any penalty he may attach to the violation
    of it awaken one feeling of remorse or selfcondemnation in the bosom of the man
    who transgresses the law under a clear and firm conviction that it enjoins what
    a regard to a higher lawthe law of rectitude or of godforbids the mere utterance
    of will can never of itself add moral qualities to an act or bring one under an
    obligation to perform it and it matters not whether this will be that of an individual
    or of a community for mere numbers in a case of this sort go for nothing where
    x   a or a amount to no more as dr brown puts it though he erroneously ascribes
    this argument to cudworth  it must either be right to obey the law and wrong to
    disobey it or indifferent whether we obey it or not if it be morally indifferent
    whether we obey it or not the law which may or may not be obeyed with equal virtue
    cannot be a source of virtue and if it be right to obey it the very supposition
    that it is right to obey it implies a notion of right and wrong that is antecedent
    to the law and gives it its moral efficacy  it is not easy to conceive what could

  text: niack dr joseph b l a c k for science that a situation so favourable presented
    itself a situation which allowed him full time to dedicate his talents to the
    cultivation of chemistry which had now become his favourite science along with
    the lectureship on chemistry dr blacks first appointment in the university of
    glasgow was to the professorship of anatomy but the latter branch of medical study
    was either not so suitable to his taste or he did not consider himself so well
    qualified to be useful in it for soon after arrangements were made with the professor
    of medicine by which the professors exchanged departments dr black undertaking
    that of the institutes and practice of medicine at this time his lectures on medicine
    formed his chief occupation  while the perspicuity and simplicity the caution
    and moderation which he discovered in the doctrines which he delivered gave great
    satisfaction r lhe time and attention which were occupied in these lectures and
    in the medical practice in some measure necessarily connected with his situation
    are supposed by some to have been the principal cause of dr black s haying suddenly
    stopped short in that brilliant career on which he had at first so successfully
    entered it is more probable however that the calm and unambitious temper which
    seems to have formed a striking feature of his character and which a less friendly
    hand than his learned biographer might have set down as nearly allied to indolence
    checked the ardour and perseverance which were necessary to excite and carry him
    forward in the path of research and discovery whatever may have been the cause
    it is to be regretted that dr black so conspicuous for his patient judicious and
    elegant mode of investigation and so distinguished for the simplicity perspicuity
    and precision of his reasonings and deductions should have contributed so little
    in rearing the noble superstructure of chemical science the foundation of which
    he had been the means of establishing on a firm and solid basis the theory of
    the nature of quicklime and the cause of its causticity soon became known to the
    german chemists and from them it met with strong opposition various mysterious
    doctrines at this time prevailed in the german schools concerning the peculiar
    nature of fire  and as the notions there entertained of the causticity of alkaline
    substances involved some of these doctrines a great many objections were started
    to a theory which threatened to overthrow long established and favourite opinions
    the most formidable opponent of the new theory was professor meyer of osnaburg
    all the phenomena of the causticity and mildness of lime and alkali were according
    to his explanation to be accounted for by the action of a substance of a peculiar
    nature to which he gave the name of acidum pingue this substance which was supposed
    to be formed in the lime during calcination consisted of an igneous matter in
    a certain state of combination with other substances it is a matter of some surprise
    that dr black should have experienced any uneasiness on account of the opposition
    made to this discovery on mere hypothesis unsupported by facts or even by plausible
    arguments when his own doctrine had been fully and irrefragably established by
    the test of decisive experiment nor is it less surprising that in the course of
    his lectures for several years he should have taken great pains in refuting the
    arguments and in combating the objections of meyer dr blacks reception at the
    university of glasgow was highly flattering and encouraging as a student he had
    not only done himself much credit by his successful progress in the different
    pursuits in which he was engaged but he had also during his residence there conciliated
    in a high degree the attachment and affection of the professors when he returned
    as a professor he immediately became connected in the strictest friendship with
    dr black adam smith then professor of moral philosophy in that i r jose  h university
    and the friendship thus commenced grew stronger and stronger and was never interrupted
    throughout the whole of their lives a simplicity and sensibility an incorruptible
    integrity the strictest delicacy and singular correctness of manners marked the
    character of each of these philosophers and firmly bound them together in the
    closest union at glasgow dr black soon acquired great reputation as a professor
    and became a favourite physician in that large and active city his engaging countenance
    his agreeable and attractive manners free from all studied endeavours to please
    and the kind concern he took in the cases intrusted to his care made him a most
    welcome visitor in every family it was between the years  and  that he brought
    to maturity his speculations concerning heat which had occupied his attention
    at intervals from the very first dawn of his philosophical investigations his
    discoveries in this department of science were by far the most important of all
    that he made and perhaps indeed among the most valuable which appeared during
    the busy period of the eighteenth century to enter fully into the nature of his
    investigations would be improper in this place  but the sum of them all was usually
    expressed by him in the following propositions when a solid body is converted
    into a fluid there enters into it and unites with it a quantity of heat the presence
    of which is not indicated by the thermometer and this combination is the cause
    of the fluidity which the body assumes on the other hand when a fluid body is
    converted into a solid a quantity of heat separates from it the presence of which
    was not formerly indicated by the thermometer and this separation is the cause
    of the solid form which the fluid assumes when a liquid body is raised to the
    boiling temperature by the continued and copious application of heat its particles
    suddenly attract to themselves a great quantity of heat and by this combination
    their mutual relation is so changed that they no longer attract each other but
    are converted into an elastic fluid like air on the other hand when these elastic
    fluids either by condensation or by the application of cold bodies are reconverted
    into liquids they give out a vast quantity of heat the presence of which was not
    formerly indicated by the thermometer thus water when converted into ice gives
    out  of heat ice when converted into water absorbs  of heat and water when converted
    into steam absorbs about  of heat without becoming sensibly hotter than  philosophers
    had long been accustomed to consider the thermometer as the surest method of detecting
    heat in bodies  yet this instrument gives no indication of the  of heat which
    enter into air when it is converted into water nor of the  which combine with
    water when it is converted into steam dr black therefore said that the heat is
    concealed latet in the water and steam and he briefly expressed this fact by calling
    the heat in that case latent heat dr black having established this discovery by
    simple and decisive experiments drew up an account of the whole investigation
    and read it to a literary society which met every friday in the facultyroom of
    the college consisting of the members of the university and several gentlemen
    of the city who had a relish for philosophy and literature this was done on the
    d of april  as appears by the registers the doctrine in question vvas immediately
    applied by its author to the explanation of a vast number of natural phenomena

  text: o r e heid thus hume liad the unexpected credit of awakening the suspicions
    of reid by his sceptical conclusions as he not long afterwards had of arousing
    kant from his  dogmatic slumber as the refutation of humes scepticism was the
    great object of reids inquiry he took the opportunity of submitting his manuscript
    through dr blair to the great sceptics perusal hume after reading the manuscript
    wrote to reid  i have read your performance with great pleasure and attention
    it is certainly very rare that a piece so deeply philosophical is wrote with so
    much spirit and affords so much entertainment to the reader and again  i kept
    a watchful eye all along over your style  but it is really so correct and so good
    english that i found not anything worth the remarking reid had unquestionably
    in this work fallen upon a mine of the very purest metal and  by an ignorance
    wiser than knowledge worked it out with untiring perseverance it may be fairly
    questioned however whether he was in all respects consistent in his application
    of the principles of common sense to the refutation of the scepticism of hume
    or of an idealism more subtle than that of berkeley reid informs us that he  had
    embraced the whole of berkeleys system in the course of his speculative inquiries  and
    was only withheld from giving it his final approbation on  finding other consequences
    to follow from it which gave me more uneasiness than the want of a material world
    his reading in philosophy was to say the least exceedingly limited and this limitation
    had both its advantages and its disadvantages for while it kept his mind comparatively
    tree and untrammelled to look at the facts which his consciousness revealed to
    him it by this very freedom threw him off his guard in analysing the contents
    of his experience and deluded him with the conviction that when he had confuted
    a doctrine under a particular development his principles were proof against that
    doctrine under whatever guise it might assume so it was with the doctrine of idealism
    which he hastily identified with the idealism of berkeley he raised however a
    substantial protest against the doctrines which it was his business to refute
    and in his future work was more guarded in his expression as well as more circumspect
    in his estimate of philosophical opinionthe fame of dr reid spread rapidly all
    over the country and in  he was invited to glasgow to fill the chair of moral
    philosophy then vacated by dr adam smith glasgow at that time presented strong
    attractions to a man of dr reids habits of mind simson moor and black were still
    in the full vigour of their faculties and were still looking forward to long years
    of intellectual enjoyment animated by the presence and stimulated by the zeal
    of such associates dr reid entered upon the new scene of his labours wiui an ardour
    that was very uncommon at his period of life dugald stewart who was a pupil of
    reids in glasgow and who has left us an elegant account of his life and writings
    in speaking of his merits as a public teacher bears the following testimony  the
    merits of dr reid as a public teacher were derived chiefly from that rich fund
    of original and instructive philosophy which is to be found in his writings and
    from his unwearied assiduity in inculcating principles which he conceived to be
    of essential importance to human happiness in his elocution and mode of instruction
    there was nothing peculiarly attractive  a brief account of aristotles logic with
    remarks appeared in  from the pen of dr reid in the second volume of lord karness
    sketches of the history of man in  reid resolved to retire from his public duties
    and to devote himself while his health and faculties would permit to the further
    elucidation of the phenomena and laws of the human mind although at that time
    upwards of seventy neither in vigour of body nor of mind did he seem to have sustained
    any injury from time fie published his essays on the intellectual powers of man
    in   and his essays i d on the active powers of man appeared in  this last reid
    performance may be said to have closed his literary career for with the exception
    of short occasional essays on subjects which happened to interest him written
    for a philosophical society of which he was a member it w r as the last work he
    ever wrote his active and useful life was now drawing to a close fie was seized
    with a violent disorder in the month of september  and after a severe struggle
    he died on the th of the following month in the eightyseventh year of his age
    dr reid though somewhat under the middle size was uncommonly muscular and athleticadvantages
    to which his habits of temperance and exercise as well as the extreme evenness
    of his temper contributed not a little in private he combined the dignity of the
    philosopher with the amiable modesty and gentleness of the child his philosophical
    genius was peculiarly distinguished by a singular patience of thought and by a
    cautious discriminating judgment fie was endowed by nature with a disposition
    which early worked itself into a habit of rivetting his most fixed and concentrated
    attention on his own mental operations  and though there have been men who with
    such a disposition would unquestionably have drawn from the evanescent sphere
    on which he fixed his contemplation results more brilliant and conclusions more
    startling yet it remains a question whether a loftier genius would have outshone
    reid in the ultimate task of photographing so to speak the phenomena of the human
    consciousness and of cautiously attending to what that consciousness implied he
    was by no means a brilliant thinker  but no philosopher ever surpassed him in
    patience his style was simple easy and familiar and perhaps his works have suffered
    somewhat from not being written in a language more elaborately technical or at
    least in a manner less readily accessible to the ordinary comprehension of men
    since reids time the estimates of his philosophical capacity have been alike curious
    and various some would have him endowed with a commanding genius at whose light
    darkness became visible and before whose glow all things false were consumed others
    would degrade him beneath the dignity of the philosophical class and have men
    believe he had no business among philosophers extravagant as these estimates must
    appear they might perhaps find an explanation in the mode of writing which the
    author adopted to the one class not very discriminating his simple and familiar
    language would at once declare him the man of genius while with the other class
    equally undiscriminating the absence of rigorous and severe technicality would
    at once erect a barrier between his talent and their appreciation suffice it to
    say that his philosophy of common sense his theory of external perception still
    holds ground amid the war of conflicting systems and the general uprooting of
    opinion  and so far as one can observe amid the dim and dusky confusion attendant
    on the strife it is a philosophy or if men will a bundle of theories which is
    likely to outride the rough weather of human speculation for a considerable time
    to come the polemic which reid implicitly or explicitly carried on was of a twofold
    character and the method which he brought to it was in some measure peculiar in
    the first place it was against the scepticism of hume he directed his primary
    and ineradicable beliefs and in the second it was at the idealism of berkeley
    he aimed his principles of the common sense hume as a sceptic who knew well the
    functions he had to fulfil accepted the premises afforded him by the sensationalists
    and carried these premises to their legitimate conclusions these conclusions as
    all know were one weltering chaotic sea of the wildest doubt and the fatal reflection
    regarding the whole of his speculations was the perfect legitimacy of his polemic
    and the absolute justness of his reasoning it was obvious that if

  text: economists  etonohow in a country where the succession to titles to estates
    mists ant i even to the crown itself rested upon custom and y w where the application
    of even the punishment of death was rarely guided by any written definitions the
    government should have thought proper to fix by written laws the length and breadth
    of each piece of cloth and the number of threads which it ought to contain he
    was not less astonished to see the government take in hand to regulate the supply
    of commodities  proscribe one sort of industry in order to make another flourish
    shackle with peculiar restrictions the sale of the most necessary articles of
    subsistence  prohibit the storing of commodities of which the quantity produced
    varies greatly from year to year while the quantity required for consumption is
    pretty nearly the same restrain the export and import of a commodity subject to
    the greatest fluctuation of price  and dream of insuring the plentiful supply
    of corn by rendering the condition of the labourer more uncertain and more wretched
    than that of any other part of the community ceuvres de m turgot iii  it may easily
    be imagined that m de gournay would find himself encountered by opposition the
    moment he endeavoured to introduce his beneficial views into practice the grand
    instruments of this opposition were certain words and phrases which have been
    used to screen misrule in every country in which the voice of reform has begun
    to be raised  m de gournay says turgot  was opposed under the names of an  innovator
    and a  theorist for endeavouring to develop the principles which experience had
    taught him and which he found universally recognised by the most enlightened merchants
    of every part of the world among whom he had lived the principles marked out for
    reprobation under the title of the  new system appeared to him to be exactly the
    principles of plain good sense the wb de of this system was founded upon the certain
    maxim the in general each man is a better judge of his own interest than another
    man to whom it is a matter of indifference from this m de gournay concluded that
    when the interest of individuals is precisely the same with the general interest
    the best thing to be done is to leave every man at liberty to do what he likes
    now he held it as impossible that in commerce fairly left to itself the interest
    of the individual should not coincide with the interest of the community the proof
    which m turgot gives of the fundamental proposition that the interest of the individual
    and of the community in a free commerce are the same we need not repeat  because
    it can neither be rendered more clear nor more cogent than it is already in works
    with which every person is familiar who is at all conversant with political science  from
    this principle m de gournay concluded that the sole duties of government with
    regard to commerce are  to render to all the branches of industry that precious
    liberty of which the prejudices of barbarous times the proneness of governments
    to lend themselves to the gratification of individual interests and the pursuit
    of a mistaken good have conspired to deprive them   to facilitate the exercise
    of industry and ingenuity to every member of the community exciting thereby the
    greatest competition among sellers and ensuring the greatest perfection and cheapness
    of the commodities sold   to admit the greatest competition among buyers by opening
    to the seller every possible market the sole means of encouraging reproduction
    which hence derives its only reward   to remove every obstacle by which the progress
    of industry is retarded by depriving it of its natural reward it is to m de gournay
    therefore that turgot ascribes the origin of political economy in france  it is
    to the ardour says he  with which m de gournay endeavoureconoed to direct to the
    study of commerce and of political ecomists nomy all the talent which he was able
    to discover and to the facility with which he communicated the lights which he
    himself had acquired that we ought to ascribe the happy fermentation which for
    some years has been excited on these important subjects a fermentation which arose
    two or three years after m de gournay was intendant of commerce and has since
    that time procured us several works calculated to wipe off from our nation that
    reproach of frivolity which by its indifference for the more useful studies it
    had but too justly incurred francis quesnay was born in the village of ecqueville
    in the year  according to m dupont de nemours the editor and commentator of the
    works of turgot and a zealous economist he was the son of a small proprietor who
    cultivated his own little property  and he was eminently indebted to his mother
    for the forming of his mind though he was educated as a physician and rose to
    such eminence in his profession as to be first physician to the king the early
    occupation of his mind on the business of agriculture had given the current of
    his thoughts a permanent direction  and when he was summoned to reflect on the
    sources of wealth by the discussions probably to which the speculations of m de
    gournay had given birth agriculture was the object on which his attention was
    more particularly fixed he produced several works on different points of the science
    and practice of medicine  and it was only at a late period of life that his works
    on political economy appeared his chief production on this subject physiocratie
    ou du gouvernement le plus avantageux au genre humain was first published in  not
    only had the speculations which he broached and which he propagated with much
    fervour and diligence considerable success in the world but he had the fortune
    to gain a considerable number of proselytes who exerted themselves with an ardour
    for the diffusion of his doctrine and with a devotion to the opinions of their
    master which more resembled the enthusiasm of the votaries of a new religion or
    that of the followers of some of the ancient philosophers than the indifference
    with which new speculations in philosophy have on all other occasions been received
    in modern europe and which gave to the economists more of the character of a sector
    a school than has appeared to belong to those who have in recent times concurred
    in any other system of philosophical opinion there was in truth in the system
    of m quesnay and the other economists many things well calculated to attract attention
    and excite enthusiasm from a few simple principles they deduced as they imagined
    by a chain of very close and imposing arguments a system of changes which would
    easily be introduced without the smallest interruption to the tranquillity and
    happiness of the existing generation calculated to remove from society all the
    deformities by which it was overspread and to communicate to the mass of human
    beings a fulness of happiness hitherto altogether unknown at this point therefore
    we may close the historical part of this article  for the success of the great
    work of dr adam smith in a short time superseded the political economy of the
    sect and after the political economy was discredited the rest of their doctrines
    met with little regard the memory of them however is well worthy of being preserved  and
    this task we shall now in as few words as possible endeavour to perform ii the
    economists proceeded upon no utopian plan which supposes society to be composed
    of beings different from those with whom we are already acquainted they took man
    as he is a being having wants and governed by the desire of avoiding pain and
    obtaining pleasure

  text: econo economake it assume a certain determinable duration between mists tiie
    two but it has not been considered that in physics the direction given does not
    depend upon the opinion of the tilings which act in morals on the other hand the
    tilings which are depended upon for counteraction change their duration according
    to their opinion a theory which supposes that to be uniform and constant which
    is known to be the reverse is evidently absurd suppose every thing which the theory
    needs to be supposed conceive an assembly or assemblies provided to counteract
    the sovereign and so constituted as to form the most perfect counteraction possible
    that the sovereign can ordain nothing but with the consent of the assemblies and
    the assemblies nothing but with the consent of the sovereign in this case it is
    not a government of one but a government of many each member of the assemblies
    shares in the sovereignty they are so many partners therefore with a particular
    partner at their head the question is what are the interests of the partnership
    those of the nation or not  the interests of the partnership doubtless are to
    make it as profitable to the members as possible for it would be absurd to suppose
    them not governed by their private interests suppose then that there is originally
    a tendency to counteraction between the sovereign and the assemblies it is very
    obvious that they will put an end to this counteraction as far as they discover
    that the suspension of it is conducive to their private interests this is a law
    of nature and may be taken for granted as far then as the serving of the private
    interests of the members is concerned there is no balance of opposite forces the
    forces combine instead of opposing and so far the balance is lost the loss of
    the balance to this extent may be a loss engrossing the whole of the protection
    to the common interest which it was expected to yield or it may be a loss not
    extending so far if it goes to the whole extent of that protection there is to
    the purpose in question no balance at all if it does not go to the whole extent
    there will still be some balance more or less what then is the case the case is
    that the loss goes to the whole and that the balance does not exist the balance
    does not exist as far as the private interests of those who share among them the
    governing powers are concerned but it is only from the private interests of those
    who govern that the nation has any thing to fear it is only against these interests
    that the balance is provided as far however as these private interests are concerned
    the balance does not exist as far therefore as the balance is even supposed to
    be of any service the balance is excluded by the law of nature it follows as a
    corollary that in a country where the people depend upon what is called a balance
    as the whole of their security for good government they have no security at all
    such is the analysis which the econcmists present of the causes of good and evil
    in human society and of that order of things which best insures the presence of
    the one and the absence of the other that part of their doctrine which alone is
    yet known to the mere english reader their political economy is introduced as
    only an auxiliary exposition it is part of the development by which they endeavoured
    to prove the identity which they supposed between the interests of the sovereign
    and the interests of the people but as a very distinct account of this part of
    their system has been given by dr adam smith and other writers and as our object
    rather was the exhibition of those doctrines of the sect which nobody has yet
    presented to our countrymen in their own language we shall content ourselves with
    only marking the place which their political economy held in their general system
    as the society has public expenses it is necessary that mists it also have a public
    revenue to reconcile the formation econoof a public revenue with the idea of social
    order it ought nnst  to be formed if possible without infringing the property
    of individuals for the sake of which the order of society itself is established
    it ought therefore if possible to be formed without diminishing the revenue of
    individuals when the real origin of revenue the source from which it all is drawn
    is sufficiently understood the mode of forming a revenue for the sovereign without
    diminishing that of individuals would be immediately apparent the source of all
    riches is the land  because the land alone of cdl the sources of production yields
    a produce greater than the cost of the production the surplus produce of the land
    therefore constitutes a fund which is over and above the remuneration to the agents
    of production and out of which the revenue of the sovereign may be taken without
    diminishing the motive to production that is without retarding the natural progress
    of the state in wealth population and felicity to lay the foundation for this
    plan of a public revenue it was necessary to prove that the land is the only source
    of production and that manufactures and commerce though they alter the form of
    things never add any thing to the amount or value of production in the development
    of these views one of the most remarkable results at which the economists arrived
    was the necessity of perfect freedom to all the proceedings which lead to production
    as giving to produce that form which is most agreeable to those who are to make
    use of it till the time of the economists the necessity of holding those proceedings
    in chains and binding them to the will of governments was the universal doctrine
    of governments and to a great degree of speculators themselves the general principles
    of the economists respecting the freedom of property necessary to constitute the
    foundation of social order led them to infer the evil of those abridgments of
    freedom but they examined the inference in detail and showed that the meddling
    officiousness of governments to compel industry to one thing and exclude it from
    another not only failed to effect any good purposes but of necessity created obstructions
    of the greatest magnitude to production in general and tended powerfully to keep
    down the wealth population and prosperity of the state the light which they diffused
    on this subject and which soon produced a grand effect on the minds of men was
    a good the magnitude of which is beyond calculation another of their conclusions
    is that the revenue of the sovereign taken as they said it ought to be wholly
    from the net produce of the land ought to be a fixed and unalterable proportion
    of that produce the reason appeared to them conclusive if the proportion was variable
    and depended upon the will of the owners of the land they might be induced to
    break upon the public revenue and deprive the state of those benefits which the
    public revenue is necessary to produce if it depended upon the sovereign the property
    of the land might be detached from that of its produce nobody would have a motive
    to become a proprietor in land and all the advantages which depend on the existence
    of that property would be lost the production of subsistence would fail and the
    community could not exist this proportion being once fixed there is no longer
    any contrariety between the interest of the sovereign and the interest of any
    portion of his people  and the proprietors cf land are as completely and securely
    exempt from contributing to the expense of the state as any other class of the
    community the sovereign derives no part of his revenue from the subject and this
    deplorable source of the conflict of interests is wholly cut off the proportion
    being settled for ever between the sovereign and the land

  text: preliminary dissertations enquiry with the ethical treatises of the highest
    quiry concerning virtue butlers sermons and merit in our languagewith shaftesburys
    ensmiths theory of moral sentiments adam smith  the great name of adam smith rests
    upon the enquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations  perhaps
    the only hook which produced an immediate general and irrevocable change in some
    of the most important parts of the legislation of all civilized states the works
    of grotius of locke and of montesquieu which bear a resemblance to it in character
    and had no inconsiderable analogy to it in the extent of their popular influence
    were productive only of a general amendment not so conspicuous in particular instances
    as discoverable after a time in the improved condition of human affairs  the work
    of smith as it touched those matters which may he numbered and measured and weighed
    bore more visible and palpable fruit in a few years it began to alter laws and
    treaties and has made its way throughout the convulsions of revolution and conquest
    to a due ascendant over the minds of men with far less than the average obstructions
    of prejudice and clamour which choakthe channels through which truth flows into
    practice the most eminent of those who have since cultivated and improved the
    science will be the foremost to address their immortal master  tenebris tantis
    tam clarum extollere lumen qui primus potuisti inlustrans commoda vite te sequor
    lucret lib iii in a science more difficult because both ascending to more simple
    general principles and running down through more minute applications though the
    success of smith has been less complete his genius is not less conspicuous perhaps
    there is no ethical work since ciceros offices of which an abridgement enables
    the reader so inadequately to estimate the merit as the theory of moral sentiments
    this is not chiefly owing to the beauty of diction as in the case of cicero but
    to the variety of explanations of life and manners which embellish the book often
    more than they illuminate the theory yet on the other hand it must be owned that
    for purely philosophical purposes few hooks more need abridgement for the most
    careful reader frequently loses sight of principles buried under illustrations
    the naturally copious and flowing style of the author is generally redundant and
    the repetition of certain formularies of the system is in the later editions so
    frequent as to be wearisome and sometimes ludicrous perhaps smith and hobbes may
    be considered as forming the two extremes of good style in our philosophy the
    first of graceful fulness falling into flaccidity while the masterly concision
    of the second is oftener tainted by dictatorial dryness hume and berkeley though
    they are nearer the extreme of abundance  are probably the least distant from
    perfection that mankind are so constituted as to sympathize with each others feelings
    and to feel pleasure in the accordance of these feelings are the only facts required
    by hr smith and they certainly must be granted to him to adopt the feelings of
    another is to approve them when the sentiments of another are such as would be
    excited in us by the same objects we approve them as morally proper to obtain
    this accord it becomes necessary for him who enjoys or suffers to lower his expression
    of feeling to the point to which the bystander can raise his fellowfeelings  on
    which are founded all the higli virtues of selfdenial and selfcommand and it is
    equally necessary for the bystander to raise his sympathy as near as he can to
    the level of the original feeling in all unsocial passions such as anger we have
    a divided sympathy between him who feels them and those who are the  born in   died
    in   notes and illustrations note s  this remark is chiefly applicable to humes
    essays his treatise of human nature is more hobbian in its general tenor though
    it has ciceronian passages

  text: of natural philosophy wilkie the once celebrated author of the epigoniad was
    prevented by indisposition from delivering the regular lectures he used generally
    to delegate the task of instruction to his youthful pupil wilkie besides being
    a scholar and philosopher of no mean note was a man of primitive benevolence and
    integrity and of great vivacity in conversation  and the friendship which in spite
    of the disparity of their years was speedily formed between him and young playfair
    speaks as much for the social and moral character of the latter as his substitution
    of him in the classroom does for his early proficiency in science on this last
    subject we shall mention but one fact more in  when only eighteen years of age
    he offered himself with the approbation of his instructors at st andrews as candidate
    for the professorship of mathematics in marischal college aberdeen and sustained
    with the most distinguished credit an examination  comparative trial which lasted
    eleven days and embraced nearly the whole range of the exact sciences out of the
    six competitors who entered the lists against him two only were judged to have
    excelled him the reverend dr trail who was appointed to the office and dr hamilton
    who afterwards succeeded to and long filled it with much re j n  he removed to
    edinburgh where his merit and modesty very soon introduced him to the friendship
    of dr robertson adam smith dr matthew stewart dr black and dr hutton  with all
    of whom he continued on terms of the utmost cordiality during the whole period
    of their lives in  he was a candidate for the professorship of natural philosophy
    at st andrews vacant by the death of his friend dr wilkie there was no comparative
    trial on this occasion and he was again unsuccessful under circumstances which
    have led one of the most dutiful sons of that university dr cook in his life of
    principal hill to remark  how much it suffered in thus losing a man by whose talents
    its reputation would have been so highly promoted in the course of the same year
    the death of his father suddenly devolved upon him the burden of supporting the
    family and admonished him no longer to delay the final election of a profession
    he had been educated with a view to the church and was every way qualified to
    accept a living on the establishment but his decided piedilection for science
    had hitherto made him hesitate about engaging in a vocation the duties of which
    he felt if conscientiously discharged would necessarily interfere to a great extent
    with the studies he was loath to abandon in this emergency however he thought
    himself no longer entitled to indulge in those predilections and accordingly made
    application to lord gray the patron for a presentation to the livings of lift
    and benvie which had been filled by his father his lordship was too well aware
    of his merits to hesitate about conferring so great a benefit on his parishioners  and
    immediately issued a presentation in his favour although from some challenge of
    his right to the patronage induction was not obtained until late in the year  from
    this period until  playfair was constantly resident at lift and occupied almost
    exclusively with the pastoral duties of his office in this retreat his leisure
    hours were dedicated to the education of his younger brothers and to a very close
    and intimate correspondence with robertson afterwards lord robertson the son of
    the illustrious historian to whom he seems to have confined the remarks that occurred
    to him upon the different authors he perused and the subjects of speculation which
    they suggested we cannot help hoping that some selection from this correspondence
    may one day be given to the public in the year  he contributed to the transactions
    of the royal society of london a paper on the  arithmetic of impossible quantities
    which exhibits within a very small compass a striking example of the rare and
    admirable playfair talent of detaching the sound spirit of science from what may
    be termed its mysticism and circumscribing by t e most precise and luminous boundaries
    the vague and unlimited inquiries into which many mathematicians had been seduced
    by the nature of the instruments they emthe year  he was induced by very advantageous
    offers to resign his charge and to superintend the education of ferguson of raith
    and his brother sir ronald  an arrangement which restored him in a great measure
    to the literary and scientific society of edinburgh and enablec him to gratify
    himself by a personal introduction to several of the most eminent cultivators
    of science in london he had repeatedly visited dr maskelyne astronomerroyal whilst
    that ingenious mathematician was busied in  in making a series of observations
    in perthshire on the attraction of mountains  and whilst sharing the shelter ol
    his tent on the side of schehallien contracted with him a cordial friendship which
    continued unbroken for the remainder of their lives under these honourable auspices
    he made his first appearance in london in  and was speedily introduced to all
    those in whom he was likely to take most interest he seems to have kept a pretty
    full and correct journal of all that he observed during this journey to the metropolis  and
    a portion of it which is prefixed to the late collection of his works is in our
    judgment one of the most interesting parts of that publication it is not only
    written with great elegance and accuracy but affords in the fre candid and pointed
    observations which it contains on the different individuals with whom he comes
    in contact a very remarkable proof of his quick and sagacious perception of character
    and his power ot selecting and turning to account even in the fever and distraction
    of a first visit to such a scene all that was really worthy of careful observation
    or permanent remembrance in  he was received into the university of edinburgh
    in consequence of an arrangement between his two illustrious associates dr adam
    ferguson and mr dugald stewart mr stewart exchanged the chair of mathematics in
    which he had succeeded to his father for that of moral philosophy which had been
    long filled by dr ferguson who finding that the delicate state of his health would
    prevent him from discharging the active duties of the mathematical professor immediately
    devolved them upon playfair for whom he procured the appointment of joint professor
    in that department in  he published in the transactions of the royal society of
    edinburgh a biographical account of dr matthew stewart which is remarkable not
    only for the ease and purity of the style but also as containing a singularly
    clear and interesting account of the labours of dr simson in the restoration of
    the ancient geometry and of the success both of him and dr stewart in adapting
    the elegant simplicity of the greek methods of investigation to problems which
    had previously been regarded as insoluble except by the aid of the modern analysis
    he also published in the same year a paper  on the causes which affect the accuracy
    of barometrical measurements which is written with all the perspicuity caution
    and sagacity that constitute the great excellence and the great difficulty of
    such disquisitions where scientific principles are employed to give precision
    to physical observations in  he published in the same transactions a paper of
    still greater interest and delicacy  on the astronomy of the brahminsa subject
    which had been recently recommended to the notice of the european scientific world
    by the curious and learned observations of m badly in his general history of astronomy
    but had never met with so minute and scrupulous an investigation as it now received

    and to support our lofty ideas of the grandeur of human nature  and of which it
    seems hard to confine exclusively the knowledge to that portion of mankind who
    have been favoured with the light of revelation the influence of the same fundamental
    error arising too from the same mistaken idea of thus strengthening the cause
    of christianity may be traced in various passages of the posthumous work of the
    late bishop of llandaff it is wonderful that the reasonings of clarke and of butler
    did not teach these eminent men a sounder and more consistent logic or at least
    open their eyes to the inevitable consequences of the rash concessions which they
    made to their adversaries  among the disciples of law one illustrious exception

    with the supposition of the souls being able to exercise her powers in a separate

    and can signify nothing to us unless they be first known and believed so that
    the principles of natural religion are the foundation of that which is revealedsermon   there
    is an intrinsical good and evil in things and the reasons and respects of moral
    good and evil are fixed and immutable eternal and indispensable nor do they speak
    safely who make the divine will the rule of moral good and evil as if there were
    nothing good or evil in its own nature antecedently to the will of god but that
    all things are therefore good and evil because god wills them to be sosermon  natural
    religion is obedience to the natural law and the performance of such duties as
    natural light without any express and supernatural revelation doth dictate to
    men these lie at the bottom of all religion and are the great fundamental duties
    which god requires of all mankind these are the surest and most sacred of all
    other laws  those which god hath rivetted in our souls and written upon our hearts  and
    these are what we call moral duties and most valued by god which are of eternal

    between malebranche and condillac as an apology for this apparent omission i beg

    upon them till i enter upon that part of my subject there are indeed some very
    original and important metaphysical hints scattered over his works but it is chiefly
    as an ethical writer that he is known to the world and that he is entitled to
    a place among the philosophers of the eighteenth century  among the contemporaries
    of dr hutcheson there was one scottish metaphysician andrew baxter author of the
    inquiry into the nature of the human soulj whose name it would be improper to
    pass over without some notice after the splendid eulogy bestowed on his work by
    warburton  he who would see the justest and precisest notions of god and the soul
    may read this book one of the most finished of the kind in my humble opinion that
    the present times greatly advanced in true philosophy have produced  to this unqualified
    praise i must confess i do not think baxters inquiry altogether entitled although
    i readily acknowledge that it displays considerable ingenuity as well as learning
    some of the remarks on berkeleys argument against the existence of matter are
    acute and just and at the time when they were published had the merit of novelty
    one of his distinguishing doctrines is that the deity is the immediate agent in
    producing the phenomena of the material world  but that in the moral world the
    case is differenta doctrine which whatever may be thought of it in other respects
    is undoubtedly a great improvement on that of malebranche which by representing
    god as the only agent in the universe was not less inconsistent than the scheme
    of spinoza with the moral nature of man  the deity says baxter is not only at
    the bead of nature but in every part of it a chain of material causes betwixt
    the deity and the effect produced and much more a series of them is such a supposition
    as would conceal the deity from the knowledge of mortals for ever we might search
    for matter above matter till we were lost in a labyrinth out of which no philosopher
    ever yet found his waythis way of bringing in second causes is borrowed from the
    government of the moral world where free agents act a part but it is very improperly

    to oppose the licentious system of mandeville a system which was the natural offspring
    of some of lockes reasonings against the existence of innate practical principles
    as a moralist hutcheson was a warm admirer of the ancients and seems to have been
    particularly smitten with that favourite doctrine of the socratic school which
    identifies the good with the beautiful hence he was led to follow much too closely
    the example of shaftesbury in considering moral distinctions as founded more on
    sentiment than on reason and to speak vaguely of virtue as a sort of noble enthusiasm
    but he was led at the same time to connect with his ethical speculations some
    collateral inquiries concerning beauty and harmony in which he pursued with considerable
    success the path recently struck out by addison in his essays on the pleasures
    of the imagination these inquiries of hutcheson together with his thoughts on
    laughter although they may not be very highly prized for their depth bear everywhere
    the marks of an enlarged and cultivated mind and whatever may have been their
    effects elsewhere certainly contributed powerfully in our northern seats of learning

    this doctrine was first proposed by mr hume he appears to have been very strongly
    impressed with its repugnance to the common apprehensions of mankind c i am sensible
    he observes that of all the paradoxes which i have had or shall hereafter have
    occasion to advance in the course of this treatise the present one is the most
    violenttreatise of human nature vol i p  it was probably owing to this impression
    that he did not fully unfold in that work all the consequences which in his subsequent
    publications he deduced from the same paradox nor did he even apply it to invalidate
    the argument which infers the existence of an intelligent cause from the order
    of the universe there cannot however be a doubt that he was aware at this period
    of his life of the conclusions to which it unavoidably leads and which are indeed
    too obvious to escape the notice of a far less acute inquirer in a private letter
    of mr humes to one of his most intimate friends  some light is thrown on the circumstances
    which first led his mind into this train of sceptical speculation as his narrative
    has every appearance of the most perfect truth and candour and contains several
    passages which i doubt not will be very generally interesting to my readers i
    shall give it a place together with some extracts from the correspondence to which
    it gave rise in the notes at the end of this dissertation every thing connected
    with the origin and composition of a work which has had so powerful an influence
    on the direction which metaphysical pursuits have since taken both in scotland  and
    in germany will be allowed to form an important article of philosophical history
    and this history i need not offer any apology for choosing to communicate to the
    public rather in mr humes words than in my own  from the reply to this letter
    by mr humes very ingenious and accomplished correspondent we learn that he had
    drawn from mr humes metaphysical discussions the only sound and philosophical
    inference  that the lameness of the proofs offered by descartes and his successors
    of some fundamental truths universally  sir gilbert elliot bart grandfather of
    the present earl of minto the originals of the letters to which i refer are in
    lord mintos possession  a foreign writer of great name m frederick schlegel seems
    to think that the influence of mr humes treatise of human nature on the philosophy
    of england has been still more extensive than i had conceived it to be his opinion
    on this point i transcribe as a sort of literary curiosity   since the time of
    hume nothing more has been attempted in england than to erect all sorts of bulwarks
    against the practical influence of his destructive scepticism and to maintain
    by various substitutes and aids the pile of moral principle uncorrupted and entire
    not only with adam smith but with all their late philosophers national welfare
    is the ruling and central principle of thoughta principle excellent and praiseworthy
    in its due situation but quite unfitted for being the centre and orach of all
    knowledge and science from the connection in which this last sentence stands with
    the context would not one imagine that the writer conceived the wealth of nations
    to be a new moral or metaphysical system devised by mr smith for the purpose of
    counteracting mr humes scepticism  i have read this translation of mr schlegels
    lectures with much curiosity and interest and flatter myself that we shall soon
    have english versions of the works of kant and of other german authors from the
    pens of their english disciples little more i am fully persuaded is necessary
    in this country to bring down the philosophy of germany to its proper in treating
    of literary and historical subjects mr schlegel seems to be more in his element
    than when he ventures to pronounce on philosophical questions but even in cases
    of the former description some of his dashing judgments on english writers can
    be accounted for only by haste caprice or prejudice  the english themselves we
    are told are now pretty well convinced that robertson is a careless superficial
    and blundering historian although they study his works and are right in doing
    so as models of pure composition extremely deserving of attention during the present
    declining state of english style    with all the abundance of his italian elegance
    what is the overloaded and affected roscoe when compared with gibbon  coxe although
    master of a good and classical style resembles robertson in no respect so much
    as in the superncialness of his researches and the statesman fox has nothing in
    common with hume but the bigotry of his party zeal such criticisms may perhaps
    be applauded by a german auditory but in this country they can injure the reputation
    of none but their author j j  see note ccc

  text: preliminary dissertations early habits of abstract meditation to this fact
    burke probably alluded when he remarked that i by turning the soul inward on itself
    its forces are concentered and are fitted for stronger and bolder flights of science
    and that in such pursuits whether we take or whether we lose the game the chase
    is certainly of service the names of locke of berkeley of hume of quesnai of turgot
    of morellet and above all of adam smith will at once illustrate the truth of these
    observations and show that in combining together in this dissertation the sciences
    of metaphysics of ethics and of politics i have not adopted an arrangement altogether
    capricious  in farther justification of this arrangement i might appeal to the
    popular prejudices so industriously fostered by many against these three branches
    of knowledge as ramifications from one common and most pernicious root how often
    have mr smiths reasonings in favour of the freedom of trade been ridiculed as
    metaphysical and visionary  nay but a few years have elapsed since this epithet
    accompanied with the still more opprobrious terms of atheistical and democratical
    was applied to the argument then urged against the morality and policy of the
    slavetrade and in general to every speculation in which any appeal was made to
    the beneficent arrangements of nature or to the progressive improvement of the
    human race absurd as this language was it could not for a moment have obtained
    any currency with the multitude had there not been an obvious connection between
    these liberal doctrines and the well known habits of logical thinking which so
    eminently distinguished their authors and advocates whatever praise therefore
    may be due to the fathers of the modern science of political economy belongs at
    least in part according to the acknowledgment of their most decided adversaries
    to those abstract studies by which they were prepared for an analytical investigation
    of its first and fundamental principles other connections and affinities between
    political economy and the philosophy of the human mind will present themselves
    afterwards at present i purposely confine myself to that which is most obvious
    and indisputable the influence of metaphysical studies may be also perceived in
    the philosophical spirit so largely infused into the best historical compositions
    of the last century this spirit has indeed been often perverted to pernicious
    purposes but who can doubt that on the whole both history and philosophy have
    gained infinitely by the alliance  how far a similar alliance has been advantageous
    to our poetry may be more reasonably questioned but on the most unfavourable supposition
    it must be admitted that the number of poetical readers has thereby been greatly
    increased and the pleasures of imagination proportionally communicated to a wider
    circle the same remark may be extended to the study of philosophical criticism
    if it has not contributed to the encouragement of original genius in the fine
    arts it has been followed by a much more beneficial result in diffusing a relish
    for the beautiful and the elegant not to mention its influence in correcting and
    fixing the public taste by the precision and steadiness of the principles to which
    it appeals  another instance still more important of the practical influence of
    metaphysical science is the improvement which since the time of locke has become
    general in the conduct of education  it furnishes no objection to these remarks
    that some of our best treatises on questions of political economy have proceeded
    from men who were strangers to metaphysical studies it is enough for my purpose
    if it be granted that it was by habits of metaphysical thinking that the minds
    of those authors were formed by whom political economy was first exalted to the
    dignity of a science to a great proportion even of the learned the rules of a
    sound logic are best taught by examples  and when a precise and welldefined phraseology
    is once introduced the speculations of the most ordinary writers assume an appearance
    sometimes it must be owned a very fallacious one of depth and consistency fontenelle
    remarks that a single great man is sufficient to accomplish a change in the taste
    of his age and that the perspicuity and method for which descartes was indebted
    to his mathematical researches were successfully copied by many of his contemporaries
    who were ignorant of mathematics a similar observation will he found to apply
    with still greater force to the models of metaphysical analysis and of logical
    discussion exhibited in the political works of hume and of smith  see some admirable

    of his health compelling his return to his paternal roof in that short period
    he appears to have made great proficiency and he continued after his return to
    scotland to perfect himself in this art both at home and on his visits to his
    mothers relations at glasgow where it was his wish to establish himself but some
    opposition being made by the corporations who considered him as an intruder upon
    their privileges the professors of the university took him under their protection
    and accommodated him with an apartment and premises for carrying on his business
    within their precincts with the title and office of mathematical instrument maker
    to the university this took place in  when he was twentyone years of age and it
    must be inferred that he had already given satisfactory proofs of talent to the
    eminent men who then adorned that seat of learning  of whom it is sufficient to
    mention the names of robert simson adam smith dr black and dr dick the professor
    of natural philosophy there mr watt applied sedulously to business and in the
    few intervals which its concerns and ill health allowed cultivated those various
    talents which distinguished him in afterlife and there a lasting friendship was
    formed with the kindred minds of dr black and of mr afterwards dr robison then
    a student at the university and nearly of his own age he remained in the college
    until some time in the year  when he removed into the town previously to his marriage
    with his cousin miss miller which took place in the summer of the following year
    the steamengine had been a frequent subject of conversation between mr robison
    and himself and the former had suggested the possibility of its application to
    the moving of wheelcarriages about the year  or  mr watt had tried some experiments
    on the force of steam in a papins digester and had constructed and worked with
    strong steam a small model consisting of an inverted syringe the bottom of the
    rod of which was loaded with a weight alternately admitting the steam below the
    piston and letting it off to the atmosphere observing the imperfections of this
    construction he soon abandoned it but the attention necessary to be bestowed upon
    his business prevented his reconsidering it until the winter of  when he was employed
    by the professor of natural philosophy to put in order a working model of a steamengine
    upon newcomens construction when he had repaired it and set it to work he found
    that the boiler though large in proportion to the cylinder was barely able to
    supply it with steam for a few strokes per minute and that a great quantity of
    injectionwater was required though it was but lightly loaded by the pump attached
    to it it soon occurred that the cause lay in the little cylinder  inches diameter  inches
    stroke exposing a greater surface to condense the steam than the cylinders of
    larger engines did in proportion to their respective contents by shortening the
    column of water in the pump less steam and less injectionwater were required and
    the model worked at a proper speed thus the purpose for which it was put into
    his hands was accomplished  and with this mode of accounting for the defect and
    this result most artists would have been satisfied  but the case was different
    with mr watt he had now become aware of a great consumption of steam and his curiosity
    was excited to a more accurate investigation of the causes in which he proceeded
    in a truly philosophical manner the cylinder of his small model being of brass
    he conceived that less steam would be condensed by substituting cylinders of some
    material which would transmit heat more slowly he made a larger model with a cylinder  inches
    diameter and  foot stroke of wood soaked in oil and baked to dryness he ascertained
    from experiments made with boilers of various constructions that the evaporation
    of boiling water is neither in proportion to the evaporating surface nor to the
    quantity of water as had been supposed but to the heat that enters it and that
    the latter depended chiefly on the quantity of surface exposed to the action of
    the fire he likewise determined the weight of coal required for the evaporation
    of any given quantity of water being convinced that there existed a great error
    in the statement which had been previously given of the bulk ol water when converted
    into steam he proceeded to examine that point by experiment and discovered that
    water converted into steam of the heat of boiling water was expanded to  times
    its bulk or as a rule for ready calculation that a cubic inch of water produced
    a cubic loot of steam he constructed a boiler to be applied to his model which
    should show by inspection the quantity of water evaporated and consequently would
    enable him to calculate the quantity of steam used in every stroke of the engine
    this he now proved to be several times the full of the cylinder he also observed
    that all attempts to improve the vacuum by throwing in more injection water caused
    a disproportionate waste of steam  and it occurred to him that the cause of this
    was the boiling of water in vacuo at very low heats recently determined by dr
    cullen to be under   consequently at greater heats the injectionwater was converted
    into steam in the cylinder and resisted the descent of the piston he now perceived
    clearly that the great waste of steam proceeded from its being chilled and condensed
    by the coldness of the cylinder before it was sufficiently heated to retain it
    in an elastic state  and that to derive the greatest advantage the cylinder should
    always be kept as hot as the steam which entered it and that when the steam was
    condensed it should be cooled down to  or lower in order to make the vacuum complete
    early in  the fortunate thought occurred to him of accomplishing this by condensing
    the steam in a separate vessel exhausted of air and kept cool by injection between
    which and the cylinder a communication was to be opened every time steam was to
    be condensed while the cylinder itself was to be kept constantly hot no sooner
    had this occurred to him than the means of effecting it presented themselves in
    rapid succession these in a great measure have already been described in the present
    work a model was constructed and the experiments made with it placed the correctness
    of the theory and the advantages of the invention beyond the reach of doubt in
    the course of these trials he was much struck by the great heat communicated to
    the injectionwater by a small quantity of steam  and he proceeded by a very simple
    experiment to satisfy himself upon that subject when he discovered that water
    converted into steam will heat about six times its own weight of water at  or  to  he
    mentioned this extraordinary fact to dr black who then explained to him his doctrine
    of latent heat to the support of which mr watt had afterwards the satisfaction
    of contributing his experiments from some of these he was led to suppose the latent
    heat of steam to be above  but he afterwards considered  a more accurate determination
    from others he deduced the important conclusion that the sum of the latent and
    sensible heat of steam at different temperatures is a constant quantity the latent
    heat increasing as the sensible heat diminishes  or in other words that a given
    weight of water in the state of steam contains nearly the same quantity of heat
    whatever may be the bulk or density of the steam he also at this time made experiments
    upon the capacities ol different bodies for heat and upon the heats at which water
    boils under various pressures from which he ascertained that where the heats proceeded
    in an arithmetical the elasticities proceeded in a geometrical ratio

    of a series of contrivances so ingenious so strictly connected by scientific relationsas
    to he a model of experimental research quite as much as a triumph of mechanical
    art such combinations of theory and practice have now become far from rare they
    have followed the march of physical learning they have borrowed from it and they
    have contributed to it but it was watt who chiefly gave the happy example himself
    by education and habit strictly a mechanic he had the peculiar merit of apprehending
    the value of theory and of acquiring a kind of knowledge then altogether uncommon
    amongst persons of his profession he was no doubt a successful speculator and
    a shrewd ingenious man besides and this his ostensible character constituted possibly
    in the eyes of many his worldwide celebrity but such considerations were little
    likely to influence the opinions of contemporary scientific men well qualified
    to judge and least of all of eminent foreigners who generallyregard with little
    partiality the presumed commercial character of their insular neighbours dr black
    who was by no means prodigal of praise termed the steamengine as improved by watt  an
    invention which is in its present state the masterpiece of human skill not  the
    production of a chance observation but the result of deep thought and reflection
    and really a present by philosophy to the arts  professor bobison who knew r mr
    watt intimately was even more enthusiastic in his appreciation of his genius and
    sir humphry davy in a speech manifesting a just estimate of his peculiar merits
    did not hesitate to place him on a level with archimedes  but a testimony more
    authoritative and unbiassed than any of these is the fact that watt was elected
    first a corresponding member of the french institute and finally one of the eight
    foreign associates of the academy of sciences this honour to which so few can
    attain which newton once owned and which now  graces or lately graced the names
    of young humboldt oersted brewster and robert brown is a sure passport to scientific
    immortality here at least no utilitarian pride nor even the laudably patriotic
    emotion of gratitude to one w  ho had proved in more w ays than one his countrys
    benefactor can be supposed to have influenced in the remotest degree his election
    having said thus much on the position to which watts inventions entitle him in
    the narrative of the history of science we may refer wdth brevity to the generally
    wellknown improvements of the steamengine in which they mainly consist in sir
    john leslies dissertation a space of but a few lines has been devoted to them
    which seems inadequate to their importance for details however we must refer to
    the articles in the encyclopaedia where they are explained at full length no doubt
    we cannot in strictness call watt the f     inventor of the steamengine the grand
    principle of rendering the heat contained in steam available as engine an economical
    source of moving power may be traced so far back that we lose the clue altogether
    in the obscure or impracticable or simply puerile shapes in w hich the idea was
    contained even in the time of worcester  we must be allowed to doubt whether the
    history of the steamengine had outgrown the mythical stage  papin indeed proposed
    a piston and cylinder in which the vacuum was produced by steam instead of by
    the airpump as already suggested or practised by guericke  but savery   was the
    first who constructed a steamengine and applied it to the drainage of mines his
    invention included the two capital properties of steam its power of producing
    a vacuum by condensation and its elastic force at high temperatures a few years
    later the pistonfoim was introduced or reinvented by newcomen and cawley as well
    as the valuable expedient of producing condensation by a squirt of cold w  ater
    injected into the cylinder and in this condition the atmospheric engine remained
    with slight improvement for above half a century doing the work for which it was
    inventedthe pumping of water out of shafts the pump being moved by a chain attached
    to the end of a horizontal oscillating beamwherever economy of fuel was unimportant
    such was the case at coal pits but in other mines usually situated remote from
    coal it was of comparatively little use on account of the enormous consumption
    of fuel james watt was born at greenock in  and  owing to feeble health seems
    to have enjoyed little advantage from regular tuition of any kind  which hig  was
    however to a great extent made up for by the tory intelligent spirit with which
    he acquired knowledge without assistance on a great variety of subjects at the
    age of nineteen he proceeded to london where he learned mathematicalinstrument
    making but he soon returned to scotland intending to pursue that business in glasgow
    here he met with obstacles but finally by the patronage of dr adam smith dr black
    and other professors he was established as instrumentmaker to the university within
    the college buildings i mention these details because they show that watt as early
    at least as  had been favourably noticed by the most celebrated professors then
    in glasgow and had received a special pledge of their good will  it is evident
    that the professors of che lectures i   speech at freemasons hall preserved in

    was always afraid of going beyond the truth and the other of not reaching it the
    curiosity of the latter was by much the more easily awakened and its impulse most

  text: 'i n t e interest rather the vice of usury hath much more exceedingly  abounded
    to the utter undoing of many gentlemen merchants occupiers and others and to the
    importable hurt of the commonwealth this salutary statute was opposed even by
    those who should have known better with all the violence of superstitious fanaticism
    dr john wilson a man famous in his day and celebrated for the extent of his learning
    informed the house of commons of which he was a member that  it was not the amount
    of the interest taken that constituted the crime but that all lending for any
    gain be it ever so little was wickedness before god and man and a damnable deed
    in itself and that there was no mean in this vice any more than in murder or theft
    lo quiet the consciences of the bishops a clause was inserted declaring usury
    to be forbidden by the law of god and to be in its nature sin and detestable this
    statute was limited to a period of five years  but  forasmuch as it was by pi
    oof and experience found to be very necessary and profitable for the commonwealth
    of this realm it was in the same reign made perpetual th eliz cap  in the st of
    james i the legal rate of interest was reduced to  per cent by an act to continue
    for seven years only but which was made perpetual in the succeeding reign d car
    i cap  during the commonwealth the legal rate of interest was reduced to  per
    cent a reduction which was afterwards confirmed by the th car ii and finally in
    the reign of queen anne a statute th anne cap  was framed reducing the rate of
    interest to  per cent at which it stood   in the pieamble to this statute it is
    stated that c whereas the reducing interest to  and from thence to  and thence
    to  in the hundred hath from time to time by expei ience been found very beneficial
    to the advancement of trade and the improvement of lands it is become absolutely
    necessary to reduce the high rate of interest of  per cent to a nearer proportion
    to the interest allowed for money in foreign states it was for these reasons enacted
    that all bargains or contracts stipulating for a higher rate of interest than  per
    cent should be utterly void  and  that all persons who should after that time
    receive by means of any corrupt bargain loan exchange chevizance or interest of
    any wares merchandise or other thing whatever or by any deceitful way or means
    or by any covin engine or deceitful conveyance for the forbearing or giving day
    of payment for one whole year for their money or other thing above the sum of
    l for l for a year should forfeit for every such offence the treble value of the
    moneys or other things so lent bargained c in scotland previously to the reformation
    no interest could be legally charged but that great event by weakening the force
    of those religious prejudices which had chiefly dictated the prohibition of interest
    led to the adoption of more liberal opinions on the subject and to the enactment
    of the statute of th park jac vi cap  which legalized interest to the extent of  per
    cent in  the legal rate was reduced to  per cent and in  to  per cent the statute
    of anne reducing the rate of interest to  per cent extended to both kingdoms the
    statutes prohibiting the taking of interest in ireland were not repealed until  when
    the statute th car i cap  gave liberty to stipulate for any rate not exceeding  percent
    in  this rate was reduced to  per cent in  it was reduced to  per cent and in  in
    was further reduced to  per cent in france the rate of interest was fixed at  per
    cent so rest early as  and this a few short intervals only excepted continued
    to be the legal rate till the revolution laverdy  m  reduced it from  to  per
    cent instead however of the market rate being proportionally reduced it was raised
    from  to  per cent previously to the promulgation of the edict loans might have
    been obtained on good security at  per cent but an additional per cent was afterwards
    required to cover the illegality this caused the speedy abandonment of the measure  the
    same thing happened in livonia in  when the empress catherine reduced interest
    from  to  per cent ditherto says storch in loco citato those who had good security
    to offer were able to borrow at  per cent but lenceforth they had to pay  per
    cent or upwards and such will be found to be invariably the case when the legal
    is jess man the market rate of interest it has been observed by adam smith that
    the statutory i egulations reducing interest in england were made with great propriety
    instead of preceding they followed the fall which was gradually taking place in
    the market rate of interest and therefore did not contribute as they would otherwise
    have done to raise that which they were intended to reduce sir josiah child whose
    treatise recommending a reduction of interest to  per cent was originally published
    in   states that the goldsmiths of london who then acted as bankers could obtain
    as much money as they pleased upon their servants notes only at  per cent i he
    supposed insecurity of the revolutionary establishment and the novelty of the
    practice of funding occasioned the payment of a high rate of interest for a large
    portion of the sums borrowed by the public in the reigns of william iii and anne
    but private persons of undoubted credit could then borrow at less than  per cent
    during the reign of george ii the market rate of interest fluctuated from  to  and  per
    cent  smith mentions that the increased means of profitably investing capital
    acquired during the war terminated by the peace of paris in  raised the market
    rate of interest to a level with the statutory rate or perhaps higher but it was
    not until the subsequent european war that any very material or general inconvenience
    was found to result from the limitation of interest to  per cent it is necessary
    however to observe that this remark applies exclusively to loans negotiated by
    individuals who could offer unexceptionable security  for since the act of  persons
    engaged in employments of more than ordinary hazard or whose character for prudence
    and punctuality did not stand high or who could only offer inferior security were
    unable to borrow at  per cent and were consequently compelled to resort to a variety
    of schemes for defeating or evading the enactments in the statute the most common
    device was the sale of an annuity thus supposing an individual whose personal
    credit was indifferent and who had only the liferent of an estate to give in security
    wished to borrow he sold an annuity to the lender sufficient to pay the interest
    stipulated for which because of the risks and odium attending such transactions
    was always higher than the market rate and also to pay the premium necessary to
    insure payment of the principal at the death of the borrower it is curious to
    observe that though the sale of an irredeemable life annuity at a rate exceeding
    legal interest was not reckoned fraudulent or usurious yet so late as  lord hardwicke
    held that in their less exceptionable form or when they were redeemable their
    sale could be looked upon in no other light than  interest  storch traite deconomic

    an v   unnecessary expense by purchasing bills on london at a greater jtwewzmwi
    than would suffice to cover the expense of a money remittance if owing to the
    badness of roads disturbances in the country or any other cause the expense of
    remitting money from glasgow to london were increased the difference in the rate
    of exchange between them might also be proportionally increased but in every case
    the extent to which this difference could attain would be limited by and could
    not for any considerable period exceed the cost of remitting cash exchange transactions
    become more complex when one place as is often the case discharges its debts to
    another by means of bills drawn on a third place thus though london should owe
    nothing to glasgow yet if glasgow be indebted to london london to manchester and
    manchester to glasgow the latter may wholly or partially discharge her debt to
    london by remitting bills on manchester she may wholly discharge it provided the
    debt due to her by manchester exceed or is equal to the debt due by hei to london
    if however it be not equal to the latter glasgow will either have to remit money
    to london to pay the balance of debt or bills on some other place indebted to
    her transactions in inland bills of exchange are almost entirely conducted by
    bankers who charge a cei tain rate per cent for their trouble and who by means
    of theii ciedit and connections are able on all occasions to supply the demands
    of their customers london because of its extensive correspondence with other parts
    of the country occasioned partly by its immense commerce partly by its being the
    seat of government and the place to which the revenue is remitted and partly by
    its currency consisting of bank of england paper for which the notes of the country
    banks are rendered exchangeable has become the grand focus in which the money
    transactions of the united kingdom centre and in which they are all ultimately
    adjusted these circumstances but especially the demand for bills on london to
    remit revenue and the superior value of bank of england paper render the exchange
    between london and other parts of the country invariably in her favour bills on
    london drawn in edinburgh and glasgow were formerly made payable at forty days
    date which was equivalent to a premium of about  per cent but owing to the greater
    facility of communication this premium is now reduced to twenty days interest
    or to about i per cent bills for remitting the revenue from scotland are now drawn
    at thirty days previously to  they were drawn at sixty days these statements are
    sufficient to show that how well soever bills of exchange may be fitted for facilitating
    the operations of commerce and saving the trouble and expense attending the transportation
    of money mercantile transactions cannot be adjusted by their means except in so
    far as they mutually balance each other a real bill of exchange is merely an order
    entitling the holdei to receive payment of a debt due by the person on whom it
    is drawn it is essential to the existence of such bill that an equivalent amount
    of debt should be contracted and hence as the amount of the real bills of exchange
    drawn on any number of merchants cannot exceed the amount of their debts if a
    greater sum be owing by them than they owe to others the balance must either be
    paid in money or by the delivery of some sort of commodities if fis in the case
    referred to glasgow owe london ll while london only owes glasgow l a reciprocal
    transfer of debts may be made to the extent of l but the glasgow merchants cannot
    discharge the additional l by means of bills on london for by the supposition
    london only owed them l and they have drawn for its amount this balance must therefore
    be discharged by an actual money payment or by the delivery of some species of
    pioduce or by bills on some third party indebted to glasexchange gow   it is not
    meant by this to insinuate that fictitious bills of exchange or bills drawn on
    persons who are not really indebtedto the drawer are either unknown or very rare
    in commercial countries bills of this description are always to be met with  but
    they are a device for obtaining loans and cannot transfer real debts a of london
    may form a connection with b of glasgow and draw bills upon him payable a certain
    number of days after date which the latter may retire by selling bills upon a
    the merchants who purchase or the bankers who discount these bills advance their
    value to the drawers who by means of this system of drawing and redrawing command
    a borrowed capital equal to the amount of the fictitious paper in circulation
    it is clear however that the negotiation of such bills cannot assist in transferring
    and settling the bona fide debts of two or more places fictitious bills mutually
    balance each other those drawn by london on glasgow equal those drawn by glasgow
    on london for the one set is drawn to pay the otherthe second destroys the first
    and the result is nothing the raising of money by means of fictitious bills has
    been severely censured by adam smith who says it entails a ruinous expense on
    those engaged in it and is resorted to only by projectors or persons of suspicious
    credit when fictitious bills are drawn at two months date it is common to charge
    in addition to the ordinary interest a commission of half or quarter per cent
    which must be paid every time the bill is discounted or at least six times ayear
    the total expense of money raised in this way could not therefore supposing the
    transaction to be always on account of the same individual and interest  per cent
    be estimated at less than  or  per cent per annum ex stamps and the payment of
    so high an interest on borrowed capital in a country where the ordinary rate of
    mercantile profit is not supposed to average more than from six to eight per cent
    could not fail to be frequently productive of ruin to the borrower but it seldom
    happens that in the negotiation of fictitious bills the charge for commission
    falls on one individual only loans obtained in this way are usually on account
    of two or more parties at one time a fictitious bill is drawn by a of london on
    b of glasgow and in this case the latter will before the bill becomes due draw
    upon a for its amount including interest and commission at another time the transaction
    will be on account of b who in that case has to pay commission to his friend in
    london  so that each party may on the whole as mr thornton has observed gain about
    as much as he pays in the shape of commission it is often extremely difficult
    to distinguish fictitious bills from those which have arisen out of real transactions
    neither does it seem to be of any very material importance the character and credit
    of the parties whose names are attached to bills are the only criteria by which
    merchants or bankers can judge whether they ought to negotiate them the circumstance
    of an individual offering accommodation paper for discount ought unquestionably
    if it be known to excite suspicions of his credit but unless in so far as the
    drawing of fictitious bills may be held to be indicative of overtrading or of
    a deficiency of capital to carry on the business in which the party is engaged
    there does not appear to be any very good reason for refusing to discount them
    within the last few years it has been the practice to grant money orders payable
    on presentation at the different postoffices for sums of l and under these orders
    cost d for sums of l and under and d for sums between l and l inclusive and as
    they are not paid unless the parties in whose favour they are drawn or other parties
    well known to the postmasters by whom they are payable

    friend the rev john home and by his published defence of the morality of stage
    plays when home resigned his living in june of that year ferguson and he retired
    to braid in the vicinity of edinburgh and there spent several months in study
    enlivened by the intercourse of friendship fergusons campaigning experience appears
    to have given him a relish for a migratory life he delighted particularly in taking
    occasional excursions to the highlands and rambling amidst the lakes and forests
    of rannoch or among his native hills it was here that the lofty enthusiasm of
    his spirit was nursed and matured  and it may be said that the dignity and ease
    of manner for which he was distinguished above most of the literary men of his
    country was acquired not so much in the intercourse of polished society as in
    the wilds of athole to use his owm expressive words if i had not been in the highlands
    of scotland i might be of their mind who think the inhabitants of paris and versailles
    the only polite people in the world it is truly wonderful to see persons of every
    sex and age who never travelled beyond the nearest mountain possess themselves
    perfectly perform acts of kindness with an aspect of dignity and a perfect discernment
    of what is proper to oblige this is seldom to be seen in our cities or in our
    capital but a person among the mountains who thinks himself nobly born considers
    courtesy as the test of his rank in  ferguson succeeded dr john stewart as professor
    of natural philosophy in the university of edinburgh he had paid comparatively
    little attention to physical science  yet with only four months to prepare his
    course he acquitted himself to the satisfaction of all ferguson was appointed
    in  to the chair of moral philosophy which had long been a favourite object of
    his ambition he entered on his new duties with a degree of spirit and activity
    from which the most splendid results were to be anticipated in his discourses
    he seldom had recourse to notes but trusted to his memory a method of lecturing
    liable to abuse and generally unsatisfactory to the student though in his hands
    happily executed his class was crowded by great numbers of gentlemen of high rank
    and official station as well as by younger students within little more than a
    year after he commenced his labours as a lecturer on morals he published his essay
    on the history of civil society which was received with great approbation mr hume
    in a letter congratulates the author on the success of the book adding that he
    had  met with nobody that had read it who did not praise it about this time ferguson
    married miss burnet a young lady nearly connected with his mothers family and
    still more nearly related to his intimate friend dr black soon afterwards he began
    to cultivate a farm in the parish of currie and at a considerable sacrifice of
    private interest gratified his taste for improvement by transforming a barren
    heath into a scene which became distinguishd for beauty and fertility all this
    time however he continued to conduct the business of his class with unremitted
    diligence but seized every interval of leisure to collect materials for a history
    of the roman commonwealth whilst thus engaged he was solicited by the guardians
    of charles earl of chesterfield to superintend that young noblemans education
    which had been much neglected the negotiation was conducted through the mediation
    of dr adam smith and ferguson ferguson was persuaded to accept the charge though
    it necessitated the suspension of his lectures in the university  but having obtained
    leave of absence for the next session he joined his young charge at geneva in
    may  this connection however terminated about twelve months afterwards in the
    meantime he had very nearly been deprived of his office in the university the
    towncouncil before the conclusion of the session having thought fit to declare
    the chair vacant his friends in the university particularly drs robertson blair
    and black were exceedingly indignant at this decision and endeavoured to get it
    reversed as the council however seemed to have determined to fill up the place
    by a new election it became necessary to apply to the court of session to put
    a stop to their proceedings after his return he continued as formerly to divide
    his time between his literary and agricultural pursuits and engaged occasionally
    in the political controversies which agitated the country during the progress
    of the american war besides his pamphlet in answer to dr prices observations on
    liberty he communicated his views from time to time to sir william pulteney and
    other members of parliament and when it was resolved by government to send out
    commissioners to quiet the disorders in the colonies he was appointed secretary
    to the commission it is well known that the commissioners returned without accomplishing
    the object of their mission  but they had an opportunity of acquiring more useful
    information of the state and temper of the country than government had received
    in all the previous course of the contest whilst dr ferguson was absent during
    the session  his place was supplied by dugald stewart who about five years afterwards
    was destined to succeed him in the chair of moral philosophy in  dr ferguson was
    seized with an attack of apoplexy which though not violent was nevertheless sufficient
    to alarm his friends this formidable affection did not in the slightest degree
    impair the force of his understanding and so abstemious did he afterwards become
    as not only to secure himself against the recurrence of the disease but to enjoy
    almost uninterrupted health for more than thirty years as he could not now venture
    to lecture extempore as formerly he wrote out his course availing himself of the
    notes taken by some of the more intelligent of his former pupils he was now  busy
    in carrying his great historical work through the press this was the history of
    the progress and termination of the roman republic  vols to  a book which not
    only delights by the clearness of its narrative and the boldness of its descriptions
    but instructs and animates by profound and masterly delineations of character
    as well as by the philosophical precision with which it traces the connection
    of events no longer able for the fatigue of public teaching in the following year
    he resigned his chair in the university he was succeeded by dugald stewart then
    professor of mathematics and an arrangement was made by which dr ferguson retained
    the salary he now proceeded to revise the notes of his lectures on ethics and
    politics  and in  they were published under the title of principles of moral and
    political science though composed under disadvantageous circumstances this work
    contains an admirable view of the systems both of ancient and modern philosophers
    particularly respecting the foundations of moral approbation and the sources of
    private happiness and public security dr ferguson now in his seventieth year resolved
    to pay a visit to the ancient metropolis of the world he passed a short time at
    some of the principal cities of europe berlin vienna florence naples and venice
    and resided part of the winter of  at rome in all of which places his reception
    was extremely flattering he was elected a member of the academy of berlin as well
    as of other learned societies upon his return to britain in  he took up

    fiom v intimating or executing it but interdicted all ministers from preaching
    or administering any of the sacraments within any of the parishes of the seven
    suspended clergymen the church held such interference as a violation of her spiritual
    independence and proceeded as if no such sentence of the civil court had been
    passed many of the most distinguished ministers dr chalmers and dr gordon among
    the rest preaching in those parishes in the face of interdicts served on them
    personally the seven suspended clergymen treated in the same way the supreme ecclesiastical
    authority and on the st january  in opposition to an express order of the general
    assembly consummated the ordination by the following general assembly these clergymen
    were deposed from the office of the ministry the courtof session immediately thereafter
    pronounced the deposition null and void other like instances occurred the collisions
    between the two supreme courts became frequent and most unseemly matters were
    running into inextricable confusion the church appealed to the government to interfere
    at first the whigs were in power but they declined to interfere in  sir robert
    peel was placed at the head of a government strong enough to have applied the
    remedy and the hopes of the church were excited still no measure was introduced
    under the guidance of dr chalmers the church pursued her course with steady unfaltering
    step  but she was not prepared to prolong the controversy indefinitely denying
    the right of the court of session to act as it had done she freely conceded to
    the legislature the right of determining on what terms she held her temporalities  and
    if fairly appealed to the legislature declared that she held them on condition
    of rendering such obedience to the civil courts as they now required she felt
    that she had no altei native but either to renounce her own principles or relinquish
    the temporalities at a solemn convocation held in november  a large number of
    ministers signed and published a declaration that if no measure of relief were
    granted they would resign their livings up to the last however it was not believed
    that any very extensive secession would take place in january  the government
    not only refused to grant the protection the church required but put a final and
    peremptory negative on her claims of spiritual independence and in march the house
    of commons did the same by a large majority  the scotch members however voting
    in the proportion of more than two to one in her favour the controversy was now
    closed and it remained only for those clergymen who felt that they could not with
    a good conscience submit to the civil restraint imposed upon the church to adopt
    the only expedient now left to them and retire from the establishment on the th
    may   clergymen withdrew from the general assembly and constituted themselves
    into the free church of scotland electing dr chalmers as their first moderator
    for tw r o years previous to this final step dr chalmers had foreseen the issue
    and in preparation for it had drawn up a scheme for the support of the outgoing
    ministers for a year or two afterwards the establishment and extension of that
    fund to which the free church owes so much of her stability engaged a large share
    of his attention he then gradually withdrew from the public service of the church
    occupying himself with his duties as principal of the free church college and
    in perfecting his  institutes of theology in may  he was summoned before a committee
    of the house of commons to give evidence regarding that refusal of sites for churches
    in which a few of the landed proprietors of scotland who were hostile to the free
    church were still persisting he returned from london in his usual health and after
    a peaceful sabbath may th in the bosom of his family at morningside he bade them
    all good night next morning when his room was entered and the curtains of his
    bed withdrawn he was found half erect his head leaning gently back upon the chalmers
    pillow no token of pain or struggle the brow and hand syw when touched so cold
    as to indicate that some hours had already elapsed since the spirit had peacefully
    departed during a life of the most varied and incessant activity spent much too
    in society dr chalmers scarcely ever allowed a day to pass without its modicum
    of composition he had his faculty of writing so completely at command that at
    the most unseasonable times and in the most unlikely places he snatched his hour
    or two for carrying on his literary work he was methodical indeed in all his habits
    and no saying passed more frequently from his lips than that punctuality is a
    cardinal virtue his writings now occupy more than  volumes he would permanently
    perhaps have stood higher as an author had he written less or had he indulged
    less in that practice of reiteration into which he was so constantly betrayed
    by his anxiety to impress his ideas upon others it would be premature to attempt
    to estimate the place which his writings will hold in the literature of our country
    we may briefly indicate however some of the original contributions for which we
    are indebted to him as a political economist he was the fii st to unfold the connection
    that subsists between the degree of the fertility of the soil and the social condition
    of a community the rapid manner in which capital is reproduced see mills political
    economy vol i p  and the general doctrine of a limit to all the modes by which
    national wealth may accumulate he was the first also to advance that argument
    in favour of religious establishments which meets upon its own ground the doctrine
    of adam smith that religion like other things should be left to the opeiation
    of the natural law of supply and demand in the department of natural theology
    and the christian evidences he ably advocated that method of reconciling the mosaic
    narrative with the indefinite antiquity of the globe which dr buckland has advanced
    in his bridgewater treatise and regarding which dr chalmers had previously communicated
    with that author his refutation of mr humes objection to the truth of miracles
    is perhaps his intellectual chef dceuvre and is as original as it is complete
    the distinction between the laws and disposition of matter as between the ethics
    and objects of theology he was the first to indicate and enforce and it is in
    his pages that the fullest and most masterly exhibition is to be met with of the
    superior authority as witnesses for the truth of revelation of the scriptural
    as compared with the exscriptural writers and of the christian as compared with
    the heathen testimonies in his  institutes of theology no material modification
    is either made or attempted on the doctrines of calvinism which he ieceied with
    all simplicity of faith as he believed them to be revealed in the divine word
    and which he defended as in harmony with the most profound philosophy of human
    nature and of the divine providence the character of dr chalmers intellect was
    eminently practical the dearest object of his earthly existence was the elevation
    of the common people poorlaws appeared to him as calculated to retard this elevation  he
    therefoie strenuously resisted their introduction the church of scotland appeared
    to him as peculiarly fitted to advance it he spoke he wrote he laboured in its
    defence and extension i have no veneration he said to the royal commissioners
    in st andrews before either the voluntary or the nonintrusion controversies had
    arisen  i have no veneration for the church of scotland quasi an establishment
    but i nave the utmost veneration for it quasi an instrument of christian good
    forcing that church to intrude unacceptable ministers and placing her in spiritual
    subjection to the civil power in his regard stripped her as such an instrument
    of her strength and he resolutely but reluctantly gave her up it is as a mover
    of his fellow men as the reviver of evangelistic feeling in scotland and as a
    leader in that great

  text: censors ii census c e n c e n years but in bc  the dictator mamercus made
    a law restraining it to a year and a half which was afterwards observed very strictly
    at first one of the censors was elected from a patrician and the other from a
    plebeian family and upon the death of either the other was discharged from his
    office and new censors were elected though not till the next lustrum in the year   both
    censors were chosen from among the plebeians  and after that time the office was
    shared between the senate and the people on their election in the comitia centuriata
    the censors proceeded to the capitol where they took an oath not to be guided
    either by favour or disaffection but to act equitably and impartially throughout
    the whole course of their administration see census   censors of books persons
    authorized in different countries to examine all publications before they go to
    press that they contain nothing contrary to faith and good manners in england
    there was formerly an officer of this kind under the title of licenser of the
    press but since the revolution our press has been laid under no such restraint
    see bibliography censorinus a grammarian and philosopher ot the third century
    known by his treatise de die natali which was written about the year  and is of
    considerable importance in regard both to the chronology and astrology of antiquity
    it was first printed at bologna in  folio with two fragments by unknown authors
    entitled indigitamenta and de naturali institutione but the best editions are
    those of havercamp leyden vo  reprinted in  and that of gruber vo nuremberg  censure
    a judgment which condemns some book person or action an ecclesiastical censure
    is a sentence of condemnation or penalty inflicted on a member of the church for
    malconduct whereby he is deprived of the communion of the church or prohibited
    from exercising the sacerdotal office j  iu  census is now almost solely used
    to denote that enumeration of the people made at intervals in most european countries
    and in britain decennially the term had its origin in rome where a group of the
    many functions performed by the high officer called censor received the name of
    census an enumeration of the people was only one of them but they were chiefly
    of a statistical character i hey were especially directed to fiscal objects and
    it does not appear that the enumeration of the people was then deemed ot value
    as a source of statistical knowledge which might influence morals and legislation
    it was connected with the servian constitution which apportioned the rights and
    duties of citizens to the amount of property dividing them into six classes which
    were subdivided into centuries by a mixed ratio of wealth and numbers had the
    enumeration been deemed of value for any such other purposes besides the adjustment
    of rights and obligations as those for which statistical knowledge is now deemed
    so valuable the notices preserved of the vast collection of statistical facts
    thus made would have been less scanty and meagre and we would not have found it
    so impracticable to come to any conclusion about the population and extent of
    the city of rome itself the roman census must have been minute and full it indicated
    not only the number and respective classes of all free persons but their domestic
    position as husbands and wives fathers and mothers and sons and daughters the
    slaves and freedmen were indicated in connection with the possessions of the head
    of the house and landed property was analyzed into several classes according to
    its character and produce the important practical effect of the census caused
    it to be conducted at intervals generally so frequent as every fifth year  it
    was followed by a sacrifice of purification or lustration whence the term of five
    years came to be denoted a lustrum there were highly penal consequences to the
    citizen who neglected his registration for the census to whom as an unregistered
    person the name of incensus was given from the mixed functions to which it was
    applied we have the word used among the romans to signify the patrimony or property
    qualification of a particular gradeas census senatorius and census equester and
    we have it employed in later times to indicate taxation hence census dominicatus
    implying a feudal tax to the superior census duplicate a double tax or feudal
    casualty and the word cense used by old english writers was abbreviated in modern
    use into cess while the word census was thus applied to the taxation of the middle
    ages it will readily be understood that in its modern sense it received no practical
    application since neither taxation nor the adjustment of social rank required
    a numbering of the people and the statistic or economic ends of such a process
    were as little known as they had been to the romans under the despotic governments
    of the continent however the tendency to central organization for purposes of
    administration and police prepared the way for statistical inquiries into the
    numbers of the inhabitants of particular areas whenever there should occur an
    occasion for enumerating them it was in britain with its abstinent government
    and unrestrained people that the want of population statistics became most flagrantly
    conspicuous it is difficult at present to realize the idea that long after adam
    smiths day the number of the inhabitants ot the british empire could only be guessed
    at as the populousness of china is at the present day and as in all matters of
    statistics which have their own simple solution through specific inquiry the guesses
    about the population of the empire were not only vague but extravagantly contradictory
    during the eighteenth century the most trustworthy geographers were generally
    those who did not venture on an estimate of the population even in those european
    states which had the best means of enumeration at their command the first effort
    to take a census of the population ot great britain was made in  it did not then
    extend to ireland the success which attended this and the two succeeding efforts
    was mainly owing to the zeal and ability of mr rickman the assistantclerk of the
    house of commons where there is an organization like that of many in the european
    states for preserving a constant official record of all the fluctuations of the
    population not only m their absolute numbers throughout a whole territory but
    in the relative numbers in its respective parts as they may be affected by fluctuations
    systematic arrangements are thus prepared not only for obtaining a general census
    at anv one moment but for checking its accuracy and classifying its elements but
    to deal at once with the raw material in the selfgoverned british empire required
    great ingenuity and sagacity a census to be accurate must be taken on a uniform
    system and must be taken simultaneously any enumeration going over a tract of
    time weie it but two days must be more or less inaccurate and destitute of the
    means of correcting its own inaccuracies besides the mere abstract numbers of
    the people there  much collateral information to be recorded this besides its
    own intrinsic value is necessary as a check on the numbers  since a distribution
    into elements according to sex age social condition occupation and the like affords
    a seltacting control on the accuracy of mere figures in a census indeed it is
    a simple rule that the information returned should be ramified as far beyond the
    main facts as with safety to these it can be carried the tendency towards complexity
    in the nature of the returns must alway s be checked by the liability of the people
    at large to make blunders and create confusion where they are qmred to attest
    facts not of the most obvious nature and by the difficulty of getting a number
    of subordinate officers to understand and carry out a complex classification hence

  text: exchange  exchange corn and labour these variations have therefore no influence
    over the exchange notwithstanding this difference of price an ounce of bullion
    in one country owing to the facility of intercourse is very near equivalent to
    an ounce of bullion in another  and supposing the trade in the pxecious metals
    to be perfectly free the exchange will be at true par when bills are negotiated
    on this footing but when we compare the values ot these metals in distant countries
    especially in those where they are produced with those into which they are imported
    there are very considerable differences gold and silver like iron coal tin c are
    necessarily cheaper in countries possessed of extraordinarily productive mines
    than in those possessed only of mines of a secondary degree of fertility or where
    they have to be entirely brought from abroad and the exchange between such places
    is not a true par unless adequate allowance be made for this difference of value
    d hus if because of the expense of carriage the value of bullion in great britain
    be  per cent greater than in san francisco  ounces of pure gold in the latter
    would not be worth  ounces of pure gold in london but  per cent less  and the
    exchange would be at true par when bills for  ounces standard bullion payable
    in san francisco sold in london for  ounces the different values of the precious
    metals in different countries do not depend alone on their respective distances
    from the mines or on their greater or less progress in the arts the opinion formerly
    so very prevalent that gold and silver were the only real wealth led most nations
    to fetter and restrain their exportation and to adopt a variety of measures intended
    to facilitate their importation but these even when most vigorously enforced were
    singularly ineffectual the great value and small bulk of the precious metals rendered
    it not only advantageous but comparatively easy clandestinely to export them whenever
    their relative value declined  when says adam smith  the quantity of gold and
    silver imported into any country exceeds the effectual demand no vigilance of
    government can prevent their expoitation all the sanguinary laws of spain and
    portugal are not able to keep their gold and silver at home the continual importations
    from peru and brazil exceed the effectual demand of those countries and sink the
    price of those metals there below that in the neighbouring countries if on the
    contrarv in anv particular country their quantity fell short of the effectual
    demand so as to raise their price above that of the neighbouring countries the
    government would have no occasion to take any pains to import them if it were
    even to take the pains to prevent their importation it would not be able to effectuate
    it those metals when the spartans had got wherewithal to purchase them broke through
    all the barriers which the laws of lycurgus opposed to their entrance into lacedaemon
    all the sanguinary laws of the customs are not able to prevent the importation
    of the teas of the dutch and gottenburg east india companies because somewhat
    cheaper than those of the british company a pound of tea however is about a hundred
    times the bulk of one of the highest prices s that is commonly paid for it in
    silver and more than two thousand times the bulk of the same price in gold and
    consequently just so many times more difficult to smuggle  but though ineffectual
    to prevent their egress the restrictions on the exportation of the precious metals
    have nevertheless contributed to occasion some slight variations in their value
    in different countries the risk formerly incurred by the clandestine exporters
    of bullion from spain is supposed to have been equivalent to about two per cent
    or which is the same thing it is supposed that the restncexchange tions maintained
    such an excess of gold and silver in that v country as to sink them two per cent
    below their value in countries having a free trade in bullion in calculating the
    true par of exchange between different countries circumstances of this kind must
    be taken into account for to whatever extent bullion in one country may be sunk
    below its value in those with which it maintains an intercourse the nominal exchange
    will necessarily be unfavourable to that extent  it consequently results that
    whatever occasions a rise or fill of the value of the precious metals in one country
    affects to the same extent its nominal exchange with other countries if more coin
    or convertible paper circulated in great britain compared with the business it
    has t form than in other countries its relative value would be proportionally
    less foreign bills would sell for a premium the amount of which would measure
    the excess of the value of the precious metals in the foreign market caused by
    their redundancy in the home market and on the other hand in the event of our

    bills drawn on foreign countries would sell at a discount the amount of which
    would equal the excess of the value of our currency over that of other countries    in
    estimating the quantities of bullion contained in the coins of different countries
    a particular coin of one such as the british pound sterling is selected for a
    standard by which to compare the others and the proportion between it and them
    supposing them to be all of their standaul weight and fineness is ascertained
    by experiment a par par of exof exchange is thus established or rather it is ascertained
    change that a certain amount of the standard currency of one country contains
    as much gold or silver of the same fineness as is contained in the coin or integer
    with which it has been compared this relation or par as it is technically termed
    is considered invariable and allowance is made for subsequent variations in the
    coins of countries trading together by rating the exchange at so much above or
    below par in mercantile language that country by comparison with one or other
    of whose coins the par of exchange has been established is said to give the certain
    for the uncertain and conversely thus in the exchange between london and paris
    london and hamburg c london gives the certain or the pound sterling for an uncertain
    or variable number of francs florins c hence the higher the exchange between any
    two countries the more is it in favour of that which gives the certain and the
    lower the more is it in favour of that which gives the  ultxcq rtcl vyb  on the
    supposition that  francs contain the same quantity of standard bullion as a pound
    sterling  fr  cent is about the exact par and supposing also that the value of
    bullion is the same in both countries the exchange between london and paris will
    be at par when a bill drawn in the one on the other sells at that rate that is
    when a bill of exchange for  or  francs payable in paris sells in london for l
    or li and vice versa it is but seldom however that the coins of any country correspond
    exactly with their mint standard unless when newly issued they are either more
    or less worn  and whenever this defect becomes sensible an allowance corresponding
    to the difference between their actual value and their mint value is made in estimating  the
    sum of the existing currency of either of two countries which contains precisely
    the same quantity of bullion as is contained in a given sum of the other thus
    if our pound sterling were so worn l settsfrihe exportation of the precioua tneul

  text: forestlaws forestalling for of venevy or chase and great coverts of vert foi
    succour of the said beasts for preservation whereof there are particular laws
    privileges and officers belonging thereunto forests are of such antiquity in england
    that excepting the new forest in hampshire erected by william the conqueror and
    hampton court erected by henry viii there is no record which makes any certain
    mention of their erection though they are often alluded to by various writers
    and in several of our laws and statutes ancient historians tell us that new forest
    was raised by the destruction of twentytwo parish churches and many villages chapels
    and manors for the space of thirty miles together which was attended with divers
    judgments on the posterity of william i who erected it forwilliam rufus was there
    shot with an arrow and before him richard the brother of henry i and henry nephew
    to robert the eldest son of the conqueror was like absalom suspended by the hair
    of the head in the boughs of the forest the conqueror says the  saxon chronicle
    loved the red deer as if he had been their father  and he is said to have visited
    the slaughter of one of these animals with greater severity than murder itself
    this king is said to have possessed in different parts of england no fewer than
    sixtyeight forests besides an immense number of chases and parks legally a forest
    can only be in the hands of the sovereion  for the sovereign alone has power to
    grant a commission to be justice in eyre of the forest a chase differs from a
    forest in being capable of being held by a subject in being of smaller extent
    and subject to the common law and not to the forest laws a chase also may be comprised
    within a forest forestlaws are peculiar laws different from the common law of
    england before the making of the carta de foresta granted by henry iii ad  and
    confirmed by edward i in  offences committed in the forest were punished at the
    pleasure of the king in the severest manner by this charter many forests were
    disforested and stripped of their oppressive privileges and regulations were made
    for the government of those which remained in particular killing the kings deer
    was declared to be no longer a capital offence but only punishable by fine imprisonment
    or abjuration of the realm still in this charter there were some grievous articles
    which however were modified by the clemency of later princes and indeed the forest
    laws may now be said to be practically abolished forestalling in laic is by statute
    th and th edw vi c  described to be the buying or contracting for any merchandise
    or victual coming in the way to market or dissuading persons from bringing their
    goods or provisions there  or persuading them to enhance the price when there
    this as well as engrossing which is the buying up of large quantities of corn
    or other dead victuals with intent to sell them again and regrating the buying
    up of such commodities in any market and selling them again in the same market
    or within four miles of it was looked upon as injurious to the public by unnecessarily
    tending to raise the price of provisions and accordingly several statutes were
    passed prohibiting forestalling under severe penalties statute st edw i enacted
    that no forestaller shall be suffered to dwell in any town who manifestly is an
    oppressor of the poore a publike enemie of the whole comminaltie and countrie
    who meeting grain fish herring and other things coming by land or by water to
    bee solde doeth make haste to buy them before other thirsting after wicked gaine
    oppressing the poore and deceiuing the rich by the statute of edw vi already referred
    to it was enacted that whoever should buy any corn or grain with intent to sell
    it again should for the first offence suffer two monthsimprisonment for the second
    six months imprisonment and forfeit double its value and for the third be set
    in the pillory suffer imprisonment during the kings pleasure and forfeit all his
    for goods and chattels this statute further enacted that no forfar one could transport
    corn from one part to another without a licence ascertaining his qualifications
    as a man of probity and fair dealing the very imperfect knowledge of political
    economy that then prevailed led to the belief that the intervention of a third
    party between the producer and consumer tended to raise the price of provisions
    and that corn would be bought from the farmer cheaper than from the cornmerchant
    it may seem somewhat strange that though the law thus compelled the farmer to
    deal directly with the consumer yet it in many cases prohibited the manufacturer
    from selling his own wares by retail in order that the shopkeepers might not be
    undersold the farmer was thus forced to carry on two trades  and part of the capital
    which should have been employed in the improvement and cultivation of land was
    obliged to be kept in his granaries and stockyard whereas the cornmerchant by
    affording a ready market for the farmers produce enables him to employ his whole
    capital in cultivation  and the existence of a free competition obliges the cornmerchant
    to sell his corn as cheap as the farmer could afford to do the principle here
    is the same as in manual labour the workman who is wholly employed in one operation
    accomplishes a greater quantity of work and can afford to do it at a cheaper rate
    than one who has to carry on several operations and in the same way the dealer
    whose whole stock is employed in a single branch of business acquires so easy
    and ready a method of transacting business that with the same capital he can carry
    on a much larger business and so dispose of his goods cheaper than if his capital
    and attention were employed in a greater variety of objects  if says adam smith  a
    merchant ever buys up corn either going to a particular market or in a particular
    market in order to sell it again soon after in the same market it must be because
    he judges that the market cannot be so liberally supplied through the whole season
    as upon that particular occasion and that the price therefore must soon rise the
    rigour of the statute of edward vi was very much softened by subsequent statutes
    which successively permitted the engrossing of corn when the price of wheat should
    not exceed s s s and s the quarter and statute th geo iii cap  repealed the restrictions
    and penalties imposed by previous statutes which by preventing a free trade in
    corn and other victuals had a tendency to discourage the growth and enhance the
    price of the same this statute however did not declare that these offences should
    no longer be indictable at common law  and hence we find that when in  the price
    of corn rose to an unusual height the clamour against the corndealers was so loud
    that one of the name of rusby was indicted for the offence of regrating though
    he was not brought up for judgment it was not till the passing of the act th and
    th viet cap  that the several offences of badgering engrossing forestalling and
    regrating were utterly taken away and abolished it declares  that no information
    indictment suit or prosecution shall lie either at common law or by virtue of
    any statute or be commenced or prosecuted against any person for or by reason
    of any of the said offences or supposed offences forfar or angus a county of scotland

  text: political economy production of wealth  effect of the terri ing nation al
    wealth of every nation will be more certainly advanced by endeavouring to emulate
    and outstrip its neighbours in the career of science and civilization than by
    labouring to attain a barren preeminence in the bloody and destructive though
    necessary art of war the way in which commerce gives increased efficacy to labour
    and augments national wealth may be easily torial diviillustrated thus in the
    case of the intercourse or terrieionoflatorial division of labour carried on between
    england and b rmentp ortu s al  our superior wool added to ourcommand of coal
    augmen g jjf u j wor k meilj ant l improved machinery enable us to produce cloth
    at a much cheaper rate than the portuguese while on the other hand the soil and
    climate of portugal being peculiarly favourable for the growth of the grape she
    produces wine at an infinitely less cost than it could be produced for here and
    hence it is obvious that by exchanging cloth for wine and wine for cloth both
    parties the english and portuguese are greatly benefited each of them is incomparably
    better supplied than they otherwise would be with useful and desirable articles
    portions of theii capital and industry are diverted into those channels in which
    they are natuially most productive and most secure  and in which consequently
    it is not more for their own than foi the general advantage of mankind that they
    should be employed these statements are sufficient to expose the sophism the french
    of the economists who contended that as equivalents economists must always be
    given for commodities brought from sect of comabla fbrei  commerce could not be
    a means of inmerce cieasing wealth how they asked can wealth be increased by giving
    equal values for equal values  they admitted that commerce might make a better
    distribution of the wealth of the world but as it merely exchanged one sort of
    wealth for another they denied that it could make any addition to its amount at
    first sight this sophistical and delusive statement appears sufficiently conclusive  but
    a very few words will be enough to demonstrate its fallacy in commercial transactions
    none of the parties obtain articles of greater value than those they gave in exchange
    for them the cloth with which the english merchant purchases portuguese wine may
    have cost as much as the latter or it may have cost more but then it must be observed
    that in making tie exchange the value of the wine is estimated by wdiat it takes
    to produce it in portugal which has peculiar capabilities tor that species of
    industry and not by what it would take to produce it in england were the trade
    put an end to and in like manner the value of the cloth is estimated by what it
    takes to produce it in england and not by what would to produce it in portugal
    hence by tradsophism of ing together countries obtain commodities which it might
    not be possible for them to produce at home or if possible only at a comparatively
    heavy cost for what it takes to produce them in other countries under the most
    favourable cucumstances and at the least expense the gain of one is not the loss
    of another they are universally benefited by the intercourse  for their labour
    being better distributed and rendered more efficient they all obtain larger supplies
    of useful and desirable articles to set this important principle in a clearer
    point of view let it be supposed that in england a given number of men can in
    a given time manufacture  yards of cloth and raise  quarters of wheat and that
    the same num u a gu  en time  man taacture in poland  yards of cloth and raise  quarteig
    of wheat it is plain that the establishment of a free intercourse between me two
    countries would in these circumstances enable england by manufacturing cloth and
    exporting it to poand to obtain twice the quantity of corn in exchange for a given
    outlay of capital and labour that she would obtain in return for the same outlay
    on cultivation at home  and oland would on her part be enabled to obtain twice
    as increasing wealth  w ere the intercourse between england and portugal and the
    west indies put an end to it would require at least fifty or a hundred times the
    expense to produce portwine sugar and coffee directly in this country that is
    required to produce the equivalents sent to portugal and the west indies in exchange
    for them and no outlay however great could directly supply us with teas spices
    and fifty other most important articles  ihe commerce of one country with another
    is merely an extension of that division of labour by which so many benefits are
    conferred on the human race as the same country is rendered richer by the trade
    of one province with another as its labour becomes thus infinitely more divided
    and more productive than it could otherwise have been  and as the mutual interchange
    of all those commodities which one province has and another wants multiplies the
    accommodations and comforts of the whole and the country becomes thus in a wonderful
    degree more opulent and happy so the same beautiful train of consequences is observable
    in the world at large that vast empire of which the different kingdoms may be
    regarded as the provinces in this magnificent empire one province is favourable
    to the production of one species of produce and another province of another by
    their mutual intercourse mankind are enabled to distribute their labour as best
    fits the genius of each particular country and people the industry of the whole
    is thus rendered incomparably more productive and every species of necessary useful
    and agreeable accommodation is obtained in much greater abundance and with infinitely
    less expense mills commerce defended p  j  lo enter into a more enlarged discussion
    of this interesting and important subject would be inconsistent alike with the
    objects and limits of this article in the articles on colonies and the corn laws
    and corn trade we have examined the policy of the restrictions on the colonial
    and coin tiades and in the article exchange we have pointed out the circumstances
    which regulate the importation and exportation of the precious metals and have
    shown that instead of an excess of exports over imports being any criterion of
    an advantageous commerce it is quite the levelse and that it is by the excess
    of the imports over the exports that the gain of the merchants and consequently
    of the community is to be estimated in the fourth book of the wealth of nations
    adam smith has examined and refuted the various arguments in favour of restrictions
    on commerce in the most able and masterly manner and with an amplitude of illustration
    which leaves little to be desired a very complete exposure of the sophisms of
    the french economists on the subject of commerce may be found in the pamphlets
    of mill commerce defended and colonel torrens economists refuted in answer to
    spences pamphlet entitled britain indepeiident of commerce and ample information
    on most points relating to the practice theory and history of commerce will be
    found in the principles of political economy th edition and in the commercial
    dictionary by the author of this article when the division of labour was first
    introduced commodities were universally bartered for each other but as the division
    of employments was extended and exchanges became more numerous it became obvious
    that it would be highly advantageous to use some one article as a common medium
    of exchange as an equivalent for all other articles and as a standard by which
    to ascertain their values it is unnecessary however to inquire into this subject
    it has been already fully discussed in  much cloth in exchange for her corn as
    she would have done had she attempted directly to manufacture it how ridiculous
    then to contend that commerce is not a means of adding to the efficacy of labour
    and consequently of inrrpaeinrr woolfk t i production of wealth

    that we owe a very large portion of our superior wellbeing to the employment of
    machines of one sort or other it is by their means that the land is cultivated

    with the treasures of art and knowledge conveyed from one country and hemisphere
    to another those who reflect how cursorily soever on the immeasurable distance
    between slings or bows and arrows and muskets and heavy ordnance between the pen
    of a copyingclerk and a steampress between spindles and distaffs and spinningmills
    between a canoe and a lineofbattle or firstclass merchant ship and on fifty similar
    contrasts will be ready to admit that the progress of mankind from their lowest
    and most abject to their highest and most polished state has been mainly a consequence
    of the invention and improvement of tools and engines man was defined by dr franklin
    to be a  toolmaking animaland the definition turns upon one of his distinctive
    and most valuable faculties and is really one of the best that has been given
    in the third place the employment of machinery enables work to be done better
    as well as more expeditiously than it could be done without it cotton for example
    might be spun by the hand but the admirable machines invented by hargreaves arkwright
    crompton and others have not only enabled a hundred or a thousand times more yarn
    to be produced than could be spun by means of a common handwheel itself a great
    invention but it has also improved its quality and given it a degree of fineness
    and of evenness or equality in its parts which was never previously attained it
    would require a painter months or it might be years to paint with a brush the
    cottons or printed cloths used in the hanging of a single room and it would be
    very difficult if not impossible for the best artist to give the same perfect
    identity to his figures that is given to them by the admirable machinery now used
    for that purpose not to mention the other and more important advantages derived
    from the invention of moveable types and printing the most perfect manuscriptone
    on which years of patient and irksome labour have been expended is unable in point
    of delicacy and correctness to match a wellprinted work executed in the hundredth
    part of the time and at a hundredth part of the expense required to copy the manuscript
    the great foreign demand for english manufactured goods results no less from the
    superiority of their fabric than from their greater cheapness and for both these
    advantages we are principally indebted to the excellence of our machinery there
    are other considerations which equally illustrate the extreme importance of the
    accumulation and employment of capital setting aside the variations of harvests
    the produce of the land and labour of a nation cannot be increased otherwise than
    by an increase in the number of its labourers or of their productive powers but
    without an increase of capital it is in most cases difficult to employ additional
    workmen with advantage if capital be not augmented and if the food and clothes
    destined for the support of the labourers and the tools and machines with which
    they are to work be all required for the maintenance and efficient employment
    of those in existence at this or any other period there can be no advantageous
    demand for more in such circumstances the rate of wages cannot rise and if the
    number of inhabitants be increased they can hardly fail to be worse provided for
    neither can the productive powers of the labourer be considerably augmented without
    a previous  production of wealth increase of capital for it is only by their better
    education and training by the greater subdivision of their employments or by an
    improvement of machinery that the productive powers of workmen are ever materially
    increased and in almost all these cases additional capital is required when the
    work to be done consists of a number of parts to keep every man constantly employed
    in a particular part requires a larger stock than where every man is occasionally
    employed in different parts  when says adam smith  we compare the state of a nation
    at two different periods and find that the annual produce of its land and labour
    is evidently greater at the latter than at the former that its lands are better
    cultivated its manufactures more numerous and more flourishing and its trade more
    extensive we may be assured that its capital must have increased during the interval
    between these two periods and that more must have been added to it by the good
    conduct of some than had been taken from it either by the private misconduct of
    others or by the public extravagance of government wealth of nations p  it is
    therefore apparent that no country can ever reach the stationary state so long
    as she continues to add to her capital while she does this she will have an increasing
    demand for labour and will be constantly augmenting the mass of necessaries luxuries

    diminution of the rate at which capital may have been accumulating the demand
    for labour will decline when no additions are made to capital no more labour will
    be or at least can be beneficially employed and should the national capital be
    diminished the condition of the great body of the people would be deteriorated
    for the wages of labour would be reduced and pauperism with its attendant train
    of vice misery and crime would begin to spread its ravages throughout the largest
    portion of society having thus endeavoured to point out the vast importaccumulaance
    of the employment of capital and the manner in tion of ca which it cooperates
    in production we proceed to exp ita  plain the circumstances most favourable for
    its accumulation now as capital is nothing but the accumulated advantage produce
    of bygone industry it is evident that its increase of high will cceteris paribus
    be greatest where industry is mostp rofits productive or in other words where
    the profits of slock are highest a man who produces a bushel of wheat in two days
    may accumulate twice as fast as a man who either from a deficiency of skill or
    from having to cultivate a bad soil has to labour four days to produce the same
    quantity and capitalists who invest stock so as to yield a profit of ten per cent
    have it equally in their power to accumulate twice as fast as those who can only
    obtain five per cent on their outlays experience too shows that while large profits
    afford greater means of saving they act as incentives to accumulation hence it
    is found that in the countries which are making the greatest progress the rate
    of profit is always comparatively high in australia and the united states for
    example it is usually twice as high as in great britain or france  and it is to
    this that the more rapid advancement of the former in wealth and population is
    mainly to be ascribed we do not mean to say that high profits are necessarily
    and in every instance accompanied by a great degree of prosperity countries with
    every other advantage for the profitable employment of industry and stock may
    be subjected to revoluntionary and arbitrary governments which do not respect

    has been done these difficulties have disappeared the theory of money has been
    perfected and we may estimate a priori what under any given circumstances would
    be the effect of imposing a seignorage or of issuing inconvertible paper sect
    iiia advantageous amount moderate seignorage on coined money principles which
    should regulate its reasons why a the governments of most countries have retained
    the power of coining exclusively in their own hands in seignorage an tiquity this
    privilege was reserved to prevent the  u d on confusion which would result from
    the circulation of coins coins of different denominations were individuals permitted
    to issue them at pleasure and to give the public greater security that the stamp
    should truly indicate the weight and fineness of the metal  and in more modern
    times it has been reserved for the same reasons would be sent abroad in preference
    to them in the event money of the exchange becoming unfavourable or of gold becoming
    a suitable article of export and if as adam smith has observed it became necessary
    on any emergency to export coins they would most likely be reimported abroad they
    are worth only so much bullion while at home they are worth this much plus the
    expense of coinage there would therefore be an obvious inducement to bring them
    back and the supply of currency would be maintained at its proper level without
    its being necessary for the mint to issue fresh coins besides relieving the country
    from the useless expense of coining money sent abroad as an article of commerce
    a moderate seignorage would either prevent or materially lessen that fusion of
    the heavier coins which always takes place whenever a currency becomes degraded
    or deficient in weight previously to the recoinage of  the weight of bullion contained
    in the greater number of the gold coins in circulation was reduced nearly two
    per cent below the mint standard and of course the price and also as a means of
    increasing the national revenue of gold bullion estimated in this degraded currency
    rose much difference of opinion has however existed in two per cent or from d
    its mint price to regard to the policy of imposing a tax on coins it has  per
    ounce this however was too minute a difference been contended that they ought
    in no circumstances to to be taken into account in the ordinary business of be
    charged with any duty but that the expenses of the buying and selling and the
    possessors of coins fresh mint should always be defrayed by the public in this
    from the mint or of full weight not obtaining more proopinion we cannot concur
    the reasoning of adam duce in exchange for them than for the lighter coins smith
    in favour of a moderate seignorage appears to be sent the former to the meltingpot
    and sold them as quite unanswerable a sovereign is more serviceable bullion but
    it is easy to see that this fusion would than a piece of pure unfashioned gold
    bullion of the same have been prevented had the coins been laden with a weight
    for while it is equally well fitted for being used seignorage of two per cent
    the heavy coins could not in the arts it is which bullion is not money or legal
    then have been melted without losing the value given tender in imposing a duty
    or seignorage on coins to them by the seignorage and this being equal to the defray
    the expense of coinage government merely gets excess of the market price of bullion
    above the mint back the equivalent of the additional value conferred by price
    nothing would have been gained by the melters the process on the bullion and the
    truth is that those had the seignorage been less than two per cent the who carry
    gold to the mint would have no better reason average degradation of the coin had
    it for example been for complaint were they charged with the expense of its only
    one per cent all those coins whose value was not coinage than they would have
    had they sent it to a more than one per cent degraded below their mint staniewellers
    that they were charged with expense of its dard might have been melted but if
    the seignorage la manufacture into plate exceeded two per cent no coins would
    have been melted but there are other reasons why a seignorage ought until the
    degradation had increased to the same or a to be exacted wherever the expense
    of coinage is greater extent    defrayed by the state gold or silver coins and
    gold this reasoning isbottomed on the supposition that the or silver bullion are
    very nearly of the same value coins on which a seignorage is charged are not issued
    in and hence whenever it becomes profitable to export the excess if they were
    the abovementioned consequences precious metals coins in the manufacture of which
    a would not follow their too great multiplication might considerable expense has
    been incurred are sent abroad sink their value below that of bullion and occasion
    their indifferently with bullion it has sometimes been atimmediate fusion or exportation
    so long however as tempted by prohibiting the exportation of coins to the state
    only coins the bullion brought to the mint by prevent the loss that may thus be
    occasioned  but these individuals there is little risk of this happening efforts
    having proved singularly ineffectual have been abandoned in this and most other
    countries admitting however that it were possible which it certainly is not to
    prevent or materially limit the clandestine exportation of coins it is conceded
    on all hands to be quite nugatory to attempt to prevent their conversion into
    bullion in this there is almost no risk and the security with which their fusion
    may be effected and the trifling expenses attending it will always enable them
    to be melted down and sent abroad whenever there is any unusual foreign demand
    for the precious metals this exportation would however be either prevented or
    materially diminished by the imposition of a seignorage or duty equal to the expense
    of coinage coins being by this means rendered more valuable than bullion it no
    one we may be pretty well assured would carry bullion to that establishment and
    pay the expenses of its coinage unless the coins were thereby rendered so much
    more valuable than the unfashioned metal were government to buy bullion and coin
    money on its own account it might by proper attention avoid all overissue suppose
    the seignorage were two per cent then any given weight of coins of the mint standard
    ought provided the currency be not redundant to purchase two per cent more than
    the same weight of bullion so long therefore as this proportion is preserved between
    money and bullion it shows that the proper supply of currency has been issued

    got into circulation and if on the contrary their value  spivnonfrp ctrictlv speaking

  text: direct taxes variations in the natural rate of wages supply of labour not
    speedily accommodated to variations in the rate of wages taxation a tax and that
    it will be permanent the question is will wages continue at their former rate
    or will they rise and in this case it is all but certain that they will rise for
    the comforts of all classes of labourers would be greatly impaired by the rise
    of prices and those who previously to its taking place could barely subsist would
    be reduced to a state of destitution or rather we should say of absolute famine
    under such circumstances an increase of mortality could hardly fail to take place
    while the greater difficulty of providing subsistence would interpose a powerful
    check to the formation of matrimonial connections and the increase of population
    by these means therefore the amount of the population or the ratio of its increase
    or both would in all likelihood be diminished and this diminution would continue
    till owing to the smaller supply of labour in the market wages were raised to
    their natural rate that is as adam smith has defined it to such a rate as would
    enable the labourers to obtain not only the commodities which are indispensably
    necessary for the support of life but whatever the custom of the country renders
    it indecent for creditable people even of the lowest order to be without if a
    specific quantity of certain articles were necessary to the subsistence of the
    labourers it would directly follow that the rate of wages could not be reduced
    for any considerable period below what would procure these articles but there
    is no such absolute standard of natural wages their amount depends in great measure
    on custom and habit the articles considered as necessaries are perpetually changing
    the labourers of hindostan principally subsist on rice those of ireland on potatoes
    and those of england on bread and beef in one country it is discreditable for
    the lower classes to be destitute of comfortable clothing and of shoes and stockings
    while in others shoes and stockings are looked upon as luxuries to be used only
    by the rich in many provinces of france and spain a certain allowance of wine
    is considered indispensable and in england the labouring class entertain nearly
    the same opinion with respect to beer and porter nor have the habits of the people
    and the standard by which the rate of wages has been regulated at different periods
    in the same countries been less fluctuating and various the articles which custom
    and habit render necessary for the comfortable subsistence of the english aid
    scottish labourers of the present day are as widely different from those which
    were judged necessaries by their ancestors in the reigns of elizabeth james i
    and charles i as they are from those which form the ordinary subsistence of the
    labourers of france and spain the standard of wages has happily been raised and
    the poor have been taught to form much more elevated notions respecting the quantity
    and the species of the articles which it would be discreditable for them to be
    without the natural or ordinary rate of wages is not therefore a fixed and unvarying
    quantity and though it be strictly true that the market rate of wages can never
    when reference is made to periods of considerable duration be sunk below its contemporary
    natural rate it is no less true that the one has a tendency to rise when the other
    rises and conversely the reason is that the supply of labour can neither be speedily
    increased when wages rise nor speedily diminished when they fall and it is on
    this circumstance that the powerful influence which fluctuations in the market
    rate of wages have over the condition of the labouring classes principally depends
    if the supply of labour were suddenly increased when wages rise that rise would
    be of little or no advantage to the existing labourers it would increase their
    number but it would not enable them to mount in the scale of society or to obtain
    a greater command of necessaries and conveniences and on the other hand if the
    supply of labour were suddenly diminished when wages fall that fall would merely
    lessen the number direct of labourers without having any tendency to lower the
    taxes habits or the condition of those who survived but in the v actual state
    of things no rise of wages can be countervailed by an increased supply of workmen
    coming into the market until some sixteen or eighteen years after it has taken
    place  for there are few branches of industry in which an active and skilful labourer
    can be bred in a shorter period duradvaning all this interval therefore the labourer
    is placed in an t g esfa improved situation he has a greater supply of wholesome
    rise of and nutritious food he has better clothes and a better vktlt  habitation
    he is rendered more attentive to cleanliness and as he rises higher in the scale
    of society he learns to use more prudence and circumspection in forming matrimonial
    connections in short his opinions respecting what is necessary for his decent
    and comfortable subsistence are raised and the natural rate of wages is proportionally
    augmented but it is equally impossible rapidly to diminish the disadvannumber
    of labourers when wages fall such diminution tages of a cannot as already stated
    be effected otherwise than by the operation of increased mortality or by a decrease
    in the wa  es  number of births or both but unless the fall were sudden and heavy
    it would require a considerable period to render the effects of an increase of
    mortality very apparent and it is so difficult to change the habits of a people
    that though the demand for labour were to decline it would notwithstanding continue
    for a while to flow into the market with nearly the same momentum as before nor
    would the proportion of births to the population be materially diminished until
    the misery occasioned by the restricted demand on the one hand and the undiminished
    supply on the other had been generally and widely felt but if the country instead
    of being stationary were increasing in wealth and population the result would
    be different and a fall of wages would then be obviated with comparatively little
    inconvenience to the labourer in whatever way therefore wages may be restored
    to their natural level when the market rate declines whether it be by an increase
    of demand by an increase of industry or by a decrease in the number of births
    it can never be the work of an instant more or less time is always required in
    which to allow the new circumstances to operate and the new habits to be formed
    and there is in consequence an obvious risk if the fall of wages be considerable
    lest the opinions of the labouring class in regard to their condition and place
    in society should be lowered in the interval when wages are reduced the poor are
    obliged to economise and should the coarse and scanty fare which may in the first
    instance be forced upon them by necessity become congenial from habit there would
    be no longer a motive to occasion increased exertion or the exercise of a greater
    degree of moral restraint so that the natural rate of wages would be reduced this
    however is seldom or never the case in improved and prosperous communities in
    these the labourers are always in the enjoyment ol various conveniences and luxuries  and
    they generally contrive by refraining from some of them and becoming more industrious
    to meet and defeat a fall of wages or to hinder it from having any permanently
    disastrous influence over their condition it is true indeed as is stated by malthus
    that to whatever extent wages fall the labourers have the means in every state
    of society of raising them in the end to their former or even to a higher level
    for if they understock the labour market wages will continue high notwithstanding
    the means of employment should be diminished  while if they overstock that market
    wages will be low how much soever those means may be increased but a mechanical
    theorem of this sort is more easily laid down than acted upon it is very difficult
    to change the

    in this respect are seldom brought about except by slow degrees prudential considerations
    always operate with the greatest force on the middle and upper classes wherever
    indeed the bulk of the people are depressed and ignorant these considerations
    have little or no practical effect but in countries like england scotland holland
    and the united states where they are for the most part well instructed and well
    oft they exert a powerful influence over all but the very dregs of the population
    taxation i f driveling orts taser   p   iw  gin tobacco t bet or trd xt    taxes
    on these considerations are of paramount importance in the articles estimating
    the influence of taxes on tea sugar tobacco and bthey  i er art i c les consumed
    by the labourer that they are bourers   p aid  b y bim  in the first inst ance
    is obvious  but the quesrarely inj   s  are tbe y not really reimbursed to him
    partly by jurious increased exertion and economy and partly by a rise of wages  and
    that such is really the case is we think sufficiently evident sugar and tea having
    become necessaries and the taste for tobacco and we regret to add spirits being
    generally diffused an increase in their price  occasioned by a tax operates in
    the same way though not perhaps to so great an extent as an increase in the price
    of bread of houses or of clothing that is it tends to make the labourers more
    thrifty and less improvident in entering into matrimonial connections  and in
    this way it contributes to improve their habits and to raise wages hence it is
    found that their condition is rarely if ever chanoed for the worse by the imposition
    of reasonable dutieson the articles in greatest demand amongst them the duties
    referred to above have been largely increased in great britain since the american
    war and yet the condition of the poor has been greatly improved in the interval
    and though other causes have cooperated to bring about this desirable result there
    can be no doubt that their improved circumstances and conduct are to some considerable
    extent owing to the greater economy and prudence inspired bv the increase of taxation
    the like results are seen in other countries the lower classes are extremely well
    off in holland and yet they are apparently very heavily burdened with taxes we
    say apparently for owing to the circumstances now explained their habits have
    been improved and their wages raised through the agency of these taxes the truth
    of these statements will appear still more obvious if we compare the condition
    of the lower classes in england and holland with their condition in the great
    continental monarchies in which the revenue is principally derived from direct
    taxes on lands houses trades c their superior wellbeing in the former is a fact
    not to be demed they are better lodged better clothed and better fed  and though
    they work harder that has no injurious influence over their health on the contrary
    the chances of life in england are at least i per cent greater than in the countries
    referred to and such but for its humidity would also be the case in holland  no
    doubt therefore there is a vast deal of fallacy in the statements so frequently
    put forth in regard to the operation of taxes laid on the articles principally
    consumed by the working classes their mischievous influence has been grossly exaggerated
    sometimes through ignorance and sometimes and more frequently perhaps from less
    excusable motives in the great majority of cases these taxes provided they are
    kept within reasonable limits and judiciously assessed are countervailed or more
    by l corresponding rise of wages or by increased industry and economy or both
    and instead of being injured the condition of the labourer has in truth been materially
    improved through their instrumentality the want of providence and the dissipated
    habits that are unhapply so very widely spread are the real sources vol xxi adam
    smith has said that  while the demand   u and the price of provisions remain the
    same a direct  the wages of labour can have no other effect than tn   them somewhat
    higher than the tax p  andt ttv  further supposes that to whatever extent the
    wages of mil tax on nufacturing labour may be increased by a tax the burden wage  will
    not fall on the manufacturers or merchants but on the andti   b k an ncrease in
    the price of commodities  and that to whatever extent the tax may raise the wages
    of agricultural labour it will not really fall on the farmer or the consumer but
    on the landlord effwyf f i hes   conclusions a re correct the immediate effect
    of a direct tax on wages does not depend on the circumstance of the demand for
    labour continuing stationary but on the mode in which the produce of the tax is
    expended and the principles established in the article pot l i  ca  c n  my show  th
    at when wages are raised either thiough their being taxed or otherwise that rise
    does not tend to raise the price of commodities or lower rent but forms a deduction
    from that portion of the produce of inempif f tab d ur therwise s   he capualist  t
    h  to illustrate its operation suppose that a tax of  ner e zrtf wa f r  that
    a  kburers are    per cent of their earnings to collectors apwages ttn f   m of
    this tax ts taken from the capitalists it cannot in any way diminish their means
    of employing labour and its effect will entirely depend on the mode in which it
    is expended if the produce of the tax be laid out on additional troops or sailors
    it is easy to see that it could not be productive of any immediate injury to the
    labourer for were such the case the agents of government would enter the market
    for labour with means of purchasing derived not from the capitalists but from
    the labourers themselvesand in consequence of this greater competition wages would
    be raised in exact proportion to the additional means in the lands of government
    or in other words to the amount of r e  ax  a  n exa mple will render this apparent
    suppose t  nnn nyn k  pep  m a p arucular country receive as wages e  a year and
    suppose further that government wish to increase the military force and that to
    get the means of doing so a tax of  per cent or of l is laid on wages ihe consequence
    will be that the capitalists lono ome  int  k   market for labour with the e   employed
    by them in the payment of wages while the agents of government will also come
    into the same market with the l derived from the tax  so that between the two
    wages will be raised in proportion to the   u t the tax were not laid out as has
    been supposed in paying the wages of additional troops but in increasing the pay
    of those already embodied or of the other unctionaries employed by government
    its effect would e different in this case there would be no additional demand
    for labour the individuals receiving the tax would indeed have a greater demand
    for the produce of labour but their greater demand being merely equivalent to
    the diminished demand of the labourers by whom the tax had been paid would make
    no real addition to the total demand of the country and thus it appears that when
    the produce of a direct tax on wages is employed to hire fresh individuals for
    the service of government it raises by taking so much labour out of the market
    the price of the remainder in proportion to its amount but when its produce is
    employed to increase the wages of oubiic functionaries or troops already embodied

  text: general observations on taxation erroneous opinion of locke and quesnay respecting
    the incidence of taxes on the land smiths maxims taxation other values the smaller
    the sacrifice for which they may be obtained so much the better a diminution of
    taxation or of the expense of government benefits the public precisely in the
    same way that a diminution of the cost of food or of any useful or desirable commodity
    benefits individuals there is no mystery in the manner in which government is
    supported and taxation operates government is not a producer its expenditure is
    not defrayed out of its own labour or property but out of that of its subjects
    it is obvious therefore that the greater its expenses the deeper must they encroach
    on the means of those by whom they are paid unless as previously stated they be
    met by increased industry or saving or both but this last though a powerful resource
    is one which is not always to be depended upon and hence the paramount duty of
    enforcing economy in the public expenditure various and very discordant opinions
    have been entertained respecting the ultimate incidence and effect of taxes locke
    in england and quesnay and his followers in france and italy contended that all
    taxes however imposed fell ultimately on the land this erroneous opinion proceeded
    from their supposing that agriculture is the only productive species of industry
    whereas it is in no respect more productive than others the truth is that all
    burdens which directly or indirectly affect the producers of any article fall
    ultimately on its consumers a tax on hats for example raises their price and a
    tax on leather raises the price of shoes for were it otherwise the profits of
    the hatters and shoemakers would be reduced below the general level and as they
    would not be satisfied with smaller profits than their neighbours they would withdraw
    their capital from such losing businesses till through the diminished supply of
    hats and shoes their prices had been raised to their proper height that is to
    such a height as would yield the hatters and shoemakers the average profits of
    stock exclusive of the tax there are natural limits however to the extent to which
    taxes on commodities can be carried  and their effects differ when they are laid
    on commodities required for the consumption of the labouring classes and on those
    exclusively consumed by the higher classes but before proceeding to inquire into
    the influence of particular taxes we shall make a few observations on the maxims
    laid down by adam smith with regard to taxes in general which are drawn up with
    singular judgment and comprehension first maxim  the subjects of every state ought
    to contribute towards the support of the government as nearly as possible in proportion
    to their respective abilities that is in proportion to the revenue which they
    respectively enjoy under the protection of the state the expense of government
    to the individuals of a great nation is like the expense of management to the
    jointtenants of a great estate in the observation or neglect of this maxim consists
    what is called the equality or inequality of taxation second  the tax which each
    individual is bound to pay ought to be certain and not arbitrary the time of payment
    the manner of payment the quantity to be paid ought all to be clear and plain
    to the contributor and to every other person when it is otherwise every person
    subject to the tax is put more or less in the power of the taxgatherer who can
    either aggravate the tax upon any obnoxious contributor or extort by the terror
    of such aggravation some present or perquisite to himself the uncertainty of taxation
    encourages the insolence and favours the corruption of an order of men who are
    naturally unpopular even where they are neither insolent nor corrupt the certainty
    of what each individual ought to pay is in taxation of so great importance that
    a very considerable degree of inequality it appears i believe from the experience
    of all nations is not near so great an evil as a very small degree of uncertainty
    third  every tax ought to be levied at the time and in the manner in which it
    is most likely to be convenient for the contributor to pay it  a tax upon the
    rent of land or of houses payable at the same term at which rents are usually
    paid is levied at general the time when it is most likely to be convenient for
    the contributor observato pay or when he is most likely to have wherewithal to
    pay tions on taxes upon such consumable goods as are articles of luxury are taxation
    all finally paid by the consumer and generally in a manner that v   is very convenient
    for him he buys them by little and little as he has occasion to buy the goods  and
    as he is at liberty too either to buy or not to buy as he pleases it must be his
    own fault if he ever suffers any considerable inconveniency from such taxes fourth  every
    tax ought to be so contrived as both to take out and to keep out of the pockets
    of the people as little as possible over and above what it brings into the public
    treasury of the state wealth of nations mcullochs ed  vol vo p  in a theoretical
    point of view these maxims are alike observacomprehensive and accurate  and it
    follows were it practions on ticable that the burden of taxation should be made
    to press smiths on individuals in proportion to their respective revenues lnaxims
    a with an income of l ayear ought to pay ten times the tax paid by b who has only
    l ayear and the latter ten times as much as c who has only a pittance of l  the
    state has been ingeniously compared by m thiers to a mutual insurance company
    where the payments  by the members are exactly proportioned to the sums they  have
    insured or to their interest in the company and so it should be with the subjects
    of government it is established for the common benefit of allof those who labour
    whether with the hand or the head of those to whom property has descended and
    by whom it has been acquired  and is indispensable to their wellbeing and to that
    of every one else and being so it results that all individuals should contribute
    to its support according to their stake in society or to their means practically
    however it is not possible to attain to anything like perfect equality in taxation
    and provided no tax be imposed in the view of trenching on this principle or of
    making one class or order of people pay more in proportion to their means than
    others equality of pressure is of inferior importance in this as in most departments
    of politics we have only a choice of difficulties and what is absolutely right
    must often give way to what is expedient and practicable it is the business of
    the legislator to look at the practical influence of different taxes and to resort
    in preference to those by which the revenue may be raised with the smallest inconvenience
    should the taxes least adverse to the public interests fall on the contributors
    according to their respective abilities it will be an additional recommendation
    in their favour but in this as in every similar matter the salus populi should
    be the prime consideration  and the tax which is best fitted to promote or least
    opposed to that great end though it may not press quite equally on the different
    orders of society is to be preferred to a more equal but otherwise less advantageous
    tax were smiths first maxim restricted to taxes on property or income it would
    be as true in a practical as in a theoretical point of view equality is of the
    essence of such taxes and whenever they cease to be equal they become partial
    and unjust but in laying down a practical rule that is to apply to all taxes equality
    of contribution is a minor consideration the distinguishing characteristic of
    the best tax is not that it is most nearly proportioned to the means of individuals
    but that it is easily assessed and collected and is at the same time most conducive
    or least opposed all things considered to the public interests the truth is that
    the greater number of taxes including we believe every one that is least injurious
    are imposed without any regard to their equally affecting different classes they
    consist of duties payable by those who use certain articles or exercise certain
    privileges and by those only taxes of this sort though not proportioned to the
    abilities of the consumers are neither partial nor unfair and pro it is perhaps
    needless to say that the incomes of the different parties are supposed to be perpetual
    or of the same duration

    frequently incapable of violating those of natural justice and who would have
    been in every respect excellent citizens had not the laws of their country made
    that a crime which nature never meant to be so p  in consequence of this tendency
    such duties require the employment of a number of revenue officers and as they
    expose the producers of the taxed articles to considerable inconvenience and hardship
    from domiciliary visits they indemnify themselves by making a corresponding addition
    to the price of their goods but these inconveniences are not after all a legitimate
    consequence of duties being laid on commodities  they are occasioned by their
    abuse or by their being carried to an oppressive extent and even when greatest
    they are altogether inconsiderable compared with those that attach to the lowest
    taxes on property or income so long as duties on commodities are confined within
    reasonable limits the temptation which they create to engage in illegal transactions
    may be very easily obviated and it will be immediately seen that duties so restricted
    are uniformly more productive than those which are carried to such a height as
    to hold out any great encouragement to smuggling it may be said that duties on
    commodities do not fall on individuals in proportion to their means of paying
    them and that while they press with undue severity on persons with large families
    or who occupy prominent stations they may be almost wholly avoided by rich misers
    and those in obscure stations but in taxation we have only a choice of difficulties
    however desirable we have shown that it is quite impossible to tax individuals
    in proportion to their incomes and that any attempt to impose an equal incometax
    must certainly fail and be attended with disastrous results we should therefore
    resort to the best practicable taxes  that is to duties on commodities and it
    does not really appear for the reasons previously stated that they can be considered
    as either unjust or oppressive if duties be laid on sugar or wine those who abstain
    from their use will of course escape them surely however those who use such articles
    have no good right to complain of this seeing that they may also by being equally
    selfdenying exempt themselves from the duties sect iiinquiry into the incidence
    and effect of indirect taxes taxes on a  taxes on commoditiesit is clear that
    if a duty be particular laid on one commodity and not on others its price unless
    commodity some corresponding facility be at the same time given to its production
    will sustain an equal rise  for if it did not so rise the profits of its producers
    would be sunk below the common level and their business would be abandoned indirect
    but it depends on the circumstance of the commodity being taxes of the class denominated
    luxuries whether a tax on it will vi  v  fall wholly on the consumers taxes on
    necessaries consumed by landlords and capitalists or by the wealthier classes
    are wholly defrayed by them this however is very rarely the case with taxes on
    such necessaries as are required for the use of the labourers for they are generally
    made up to the latter by a proportional increase of wages or partly in that way
    and partly by infusing a greater spirit of industry and economy into the labourer
    hence it is seldom possible to predicate at the outset what will be the ultimate
    effect of a tax on such articles as enter into the subsistence of the poor inasmuch
    as that depends on a great variety of circumstances which it is very difficult
    if not impossible to estimate beforehand but this is never the case with duties
    on costly articles such as coaches racehorses and hounds pictures statues vases
    and so forth or on articles consumed only by the rich and the great such duties
    may indeed and most probably will even in their case reduce or limit the demand
    for the articles on which they are laid but whether this be so or not the taxed
    articles being wholly superfluous and nowise necessary for the subsistence of
    those by whom they are bought the latter have no means or power by which to shift
    any portion of the tax with which they are charged from themselves to any one
    else but it is nevertheless indispensable that the greatest moderation be observed
    in imposing such duties for otherwise they invariably tempt the wealthier classes
    to evade them by resorting to other countries and usually also induce some of
    them to take their capitals along with them  ad valorem taxes on commoditiesan
    equal ad ad valorem valorem duty were it laid on all descriptions of commoditaxes
    on ties would of course affect them all to the same extent and c  ommodi it was
    universally supposed down to the publication of ties  the edition of the wealth
    of nations by the author of this article that the imposition of such a duty would
    in no degree modify or change the relation or proportion which commodities previously
    bore to each other but though such a duty would affect commodities in the same
    proportion it would not affect the profits of their producers in the same but
    in very different proportions and it is by the degree in which the latter are
    affected that the relation of commodities to each other is determined if all classes
    of producers uniformly employed the same proportions of fixed and circulating
    capital  an equal ad valorem duty would affect them all equally and the values
    of their products as compared with each other would not be affected by its imposition
    but this is not the actual state of things  different sorts of commodities are
    produced by the agency of very different proportions of fixed and circulating
    capital  and hence were an equal ad valorem duty laid on them all it would not
    affect profits equally and would consequently cause a transfer of capital from
    one business to another and a variation in the value of commodities raising some
    and sinking others to illustrate this assuming that profits are  per cent let
    it be supposed in the first place that a advances l in wages at the commencement
    of the year and that he receives the produce which must by the supposition be
    worth at least l at the end of the year in the second place let it be supposed
    that b has a capital of l vested in a highly durable machine which is capable
    of performing its work without any or with but very little manual labour the annual
    produce of this machine being it is obvious under the circumstances supposed wholly
    or all but wholly made up of profits and necessarily selling for about l and  it
    is of course taken for granted that the fixed capitals are of the same degree

    question respecting the ultimate incidence of taxes laid on the raw produce of
    the soil is one of considerable nicety and difficulty if land yielded no surplus
    to its possessors above the ordinary profit of the capital employed in its cultivation
    the imposition of a tax on its produce such for example as tithe wxmld occasion
    an equivalent increase of price the level of profit may be temporarily but it
    cannot be permanently elevated or depressed in any particular branch of industry
    and as there is no reason why agriculturists should be contented with lower profits
    than are realised in other employments as soon as a tithe was imposed they would
    set about transferring a portion of their stock to some more lucrative business
    and this transfer would continue until the diminution of supply raised prices
    to their proper level and restored the equilibrium of profit in such a state of
    things tithe would make a precisely smith and equivalent addition to the price
    of raw produce but after ricardo various qualities of soil have been brought under
    cultivation and rents have in consequence been generally introduced it is not
    so easy to trace the ultimate incidence and effect of tithes they then appear
    to occasion a diminution of rent rather than a rise of prices farms which are
    tithefree always bring a higher rent than such as are subject to that charge  and
    it is naturally concluded that were tithes abolished the depressed rents would
    be raised to the same level as the others for this reason in an advanced stage
    of society tithe has not been considered as increasing the price of raw produce
    to the consumer but as falling on rent and as diverting a portion of it into the
    pockets of views of in regard to the incidence of tithe its rightful owners the
    clergymen and lay impropriators indirect faxes upon the produce of land says adam
    smith taxes  are in reality taxes upon rent and though they may be v v originally
    advanced by the farmer are finally paid by the landlord when a certain portion
    of the produce is to be paid away for a tax the farmer computes as well as he
    can what the value of this portion is one year with another  likely to amount
    to and he makes a proportional abatement in the rent which he agrees to pay to
    the landlord there is no farmer who does not compute beforehand what the churchtithe
    which is a landtax of this kind is one year with another likely to amount to conclusive
    however as this statement appears on a first view it is only under certain conditions
    and limitations that it holds good it has been repeatedly shown that a very large
    proportion of the raw produce raised in every extensive country is produced by
    means of capital laid out on the land in the view of obtaining the customary profit
    of the time and without its yielding any rent it must also be observed that the
    cost of producing this portion of the required supply of raw produce determines
    the price of the rest for it is produced under the most unfavourable circumstances
    and unless its producers were repaid their expenses and profits it would not be
    brought to market and a scarcity would ensue but when a tithe is imposed it affects
    of course the producers of this portion of the required supply in common with
    the others inasmuch however as they pay no rent it is clear they cannot throw
    the burden of tithe on a landlord and as they would not continue in their business
    unless they obtained the same rate of profit as their neighbours it appears unavoidably
    to follow that either the price of corn must rise proportionally to the tithe
    or that the former supply will no longer be brought to market this last is the
    view that ricardo took of the operation of tithe but however ingenious the same
    remark is applicable to his theory as to smiths that it is only under certain
    conditions and restrictions that it is correct it is clear for example that the
    effect ascribed by ricardo to the imposition of a tithe depends first on the demand
    for corn or its consumption remaining about the same after it is charged with
    tithe as before and second on the tithe being made to affect all or nearly all
    the land of a country and on its being exacted from such foreign corn as may be
    imported if either of these conditions be wanting ricardos conclusions will be
    more or less vitiated the tithe will not then occasion an equivalent increase
    of prices nor fall wholly on the consumers the commutation of tithe effected some
    years ago has made the investigation of these and other questions connected with
    tithes of comparatively little interest it is however easy to see that when the
    price of corn or anything else is raised by the imposition of a tithe or other
    tax its consumption is cceteris paribus always more or less diminished and it
    is equally easy to see that if a considerable portion of the land in a country
    be exempted from the tithe which is laid on the residue or if foreign corn be
    admitted duty free the tithe will in the former case be but slightly felt while
    in the latter it will have no sensible influence over prices  and that consequently
    it will fall principally or wholly on rent the truth is that tithes or taxes on
    the produce of land injurious are more injurious from their indirect operation
    and more operation unpopular from the mode in which they are assessed than of
    tithes from the magnitude of the burden which they lay on the public they are

  text: taxation  indirect taxes duties on the sale of land do net fall on the sellers
    with a public stamp stating the amount of the duty their ultimate incidence varies
    according to the nature of the deed or writing for which it is necessary to use
    stamped paper adam smith has said that duties on the sale of land or on the paper
    used in its conveyance from one party to another commonly fall on the seller this
    arises he says from the circumstance of  the seller being almost always under
    the necessity of selling which forces him to take such a price as he can get the
    buyer is scarce ever under the necessity of buying he will therefore only give
    such a price as he likes he considers what the land will cost him in tax and price
    together the more he is obliged to pay in the way of tax the less he will be disposed
    to give in the way of price such taxes therefore fall almost always upon a necessitous
    person and must therefore be frequently very cruel and oppressive p  but though
    smiths statement may apply in some rare instances there can be very little doubt
    that in the great majority it is quite inapplicable here there are at all times
    large amounts of capital seeking investments  and there is nothing which is so
    much run upon as land or which brings so high a price compared with the rent or
    profits derived from it the converse of smiths statement would indeed be much
    nearer the mark and there are really no good grounds for thinking supposing the
    stampduties on conveyances were abolished that the price of land would be sensibly
    lessened that the existing system of conveying land is injurious by obstructing
    its easy transfer from one individual to another is admitted on all hands that
    however depends on the difficulty of making up a good title to land and not on
    the duty laid on the paper employed the repeal of the latter would not in any
    degree facilitate proceedings that must be effected by totally different means
    by adopting a system of registration and perhaps also by giving in doubtful cases
    a parliamentary title to land as has been done with the encumbered estates in
    ireland like other duties those on the transfer of property should be reasonable
    and they should affect all properties in the same proportion if the stamp on the
    transfer of property worth l be l that on the transfer of property worth l or
    l should be l or l and so for all other amounts whether greater or smaller taxes
    on taxes on law proceedings fall upon the suitors and conlaw prosequently lay
    obstructions in the way of an injured party ceedings seeking redress in a court
    of justice the impolicy and injustice of such taxes were ably exposed by bentham
    in his protest against laiv taxes stampduties on the voluntary sale of commodities
    fall like other taxes on them wholly on the consumer for unless such were the
    case the commodities would not be offered for sale subsequently to the imposition
    of the duties thus the duties on cards and dice newspapers c are wholly paid by
    those who use them such too is the case with the duties payable on licenses to
    retail goods to exercise professions c the taxed party adds as much to the price
    of the articles in which he deals or of the services which he performs as is sufficient

  text: taxation indirect taxes a reduction of duties the only effectual means of
    preventing smuggling natural and efficient mode of effecting the object in view  but
    the second has been most generally resorted to in the great majority of cases
    governments have attempted to suppress smuggling without reducing duties by establishing
    a more vigilant system of collection and by increasing the number and severity
    of the penalties affecting the smuggler but these attempts have for the most part
    proved signally unsuccessful and it has been almost invariably found that no vigilance
    on the part of the revenue officers and no severity of punishment can prevent
    the smuggling of commodities loaded with oppressive duties the smuggler is generally
    a popular character  and though we have no desire to become the apologists of
    those who endeavour to defraud the revenue and injure the fair trader it is idle
    to expect that the bulk of society should regard those who furnish them with cheap
    tea gin whisky brandy c as guilty of any very heinous offence to pretend says
    adam smith to have any scruple about buying smuggled goods though a manifest encouragement
    to the violation of the revenue laws and to the perjury which almost always attends
    it would in most countries be regarded as one of those pedantic pieces of hypocrisy
    which instead of gaining credit with any body seems only to expose the person
    who affects to practise them to the suspicion of being a greater knave than most
    of his neighbours by this indulgence of the public the smuggler is often encouraged
    to continue a trade which he is thus taught to consider as in some measure innocent
    and when the severity of the revenue laws is ready to fall upon him he is frequently
    disposed to defend with violence what he has been accustomed to regard as his
    just property and from being at first perhaps rather imprudent than criminal he
    at last too often becomes one of the hardiest and most determined violators of
    the laws of society  p  see also montesquieu esprit des loix liv xiii cap  to
    create by means of high duties an overwhelming temptation to indulge in crime
    and then to punish men for indulging in it is a proceeding completely subversive
    of every principle of justice it revolts the feelings of the people and makes
    them take an interest in the worst charactersfor such smugglers generally areespouse
    their cause and avenge their wrongs a punishment not proportioned to the offence
    and which does not carry the sanction of public opinion along with it is never
    productive of any good effect the true way to suppress smuggling is to render
    it unprofitable to diminish the temptation to engage in it and this is not to
    be done by surrounding the coasts with cordons of troops multiplying oaths and
    penalties and making the country the theatre of ferocious contests in roads and
    byelanes and of perjury and chicanery in the courts of law but simply by reducing
    the duties on smuggled commodities we must seek in this and in this only for an
    effectual check to smuggling whenever the profits of the fair trader become nearly
    equal to those of the smuggler the latter is forced to abandon his hazardous profession
    but so long as oppressively high duties are kept up or which is really the same
    thing so long as a high bounty is held out to encourage the adventurous the needy
    and the profligate to enter on this career we may be assured that an army of excise
    officers backed by the utmost severity of the revenue laws will be insufficient
    to hinder them the truth is that the too great severity of these laws prevents
    their execution  it stimulates the trader to corrupt the officer to conceal a
    fraud  and it influences the officer to overlook what he would otherwise discover
    hamilton on the principles of taxation p  heavy duties on any description of commodities
    will occasion smuggling but it is chiefly caused by their being laid on commodities
    in general demand whose natural or necessary price is not very considerable it
    is commonly indirect said when a proposal is made for laying a heavy duty on a
    taxes lowpriced article that its lowness of price fits it to bear such a duty
    and that notwithstanding its imposition it may duties still be brought to market
    at a sufficiently moderate rate should vary but the encouragement of smuggling
    depends more on tie therieeof proportion which the duty bears to the price of
    the com modity than on the circumstance of its being absolutely mo dity high or
    low to illustrate this principle let us suppose that a taxed commodity as soap
    costs exclusive of duty lod per lb if a duty of a penny per lb were laid on it
    the inducement to smuggle would be equal to  per cent of the value of the article  and
    if the duty were d the inducement would be  per cent and so on now let us suppose
    that the cost of producing the soap or its natural price falls to d a duty of
    a penny per lb would then make an inducement to smuggle of  per cent of its value
    and a duty of d would make an inducement of no less than  per cent and hence it
    is obvious that in order to prevent smuggling a system should be adopted precisely
    the reverse of that which is generally followed in the imposition of taxes instead
    of making duties vary inversely as the price of commodities that is instead of
    raising them when the cost of producing the articles on which they are laid is
    diminished and reducing them when it is increased they should be made to vary
    directly as this costrising when it rises and falling when it falls disproportionally
    heavy taxes are the great cause of smuggling  and they have the further and most
    injurious effect of preventing its being corrected by its natural and proper punishment  that
    is by the confiscation of the smuggledcommodities recourse is in consequence had
    to extraordinary pains and penalties and all proportion of punishment being done
    away  men who as montesquieu observes  can hardly be considered as culpable must
    be punished as atrocious criminals esprit des loix liv xiii cap  certain commodities
    from their greater bulk from their susceptibility of being impressed with a permanent
    stamp or other cause are less liable to be smuggled than others and may therefore
    be loaded with comparatively high duties but as a general rule it cannot be doubted
    that to prevent fraud the duties should be proportioned to the cost of the articles
    on which they are laid sect ivcomparative productiveness of high and low taxes
    the arguments adduced in the foregoing section are sufficient to establish the
    superior productiveness of moderate taxes but the subject deserves to be treated
    at greater length  and as the history of taxation furnishes numerous conclusive
    and wellestablished proofs of the soundness of this conclusion we shall take this
    opportunity to bring one or two of them under the notice of our readers they may
    be classed under two different headsthe first consisting of instances in which
    a reduction of duty has been followed by an increase of revenue and the second
    of instances in which an increase of duties has been followed by a diminution
    of revenue  the reductions made in the duties on tea in  and history of  strikingly
    evince the superior productiveness of low  tea du duties on articles in general
    demand previously to  ties  the excise duty of s a lb on tea yielded at an average
    about l a year showing had there been no smuggling or adulteration that the consumption
    was equal to about  lb but it was well known that smuggling was then carried to
    a great height and that the real was much greater than the apparent consumption

    emotive pleasure not excitative y  of desire or aversion but purely contemplative
    is as we shall soon have occasion to observe more exactly concomitant in the first
    instance and consequent in its recurrence on a cognition specifically describable
    as a fact of imagination if looking back to the view we have already obtained
    of the process issuing in action we reconsider the first two steps the image and
    the emotion we shall understand the circumstances in which this contemplative
    pleasure arises by supposing that process to be arrested at the second step the
    emotion instead of passing on to desire reverts into imagination or some other
    phase of intellection a state of pleasing emotion having such an origin and such
    an effect is the mental state towards the generation of which poetry and the other
    fine arts characteristically strive poetry is then and then only purely and exclusively
    poetical when the pleasure which it excites fulfils those conditions and the broadest
    distinction between persuasive eloquence and poetry is before us when we regard
    the former as generative of the complete process which is consummated in action
    the latter as generating the earlier steps of that process but these only the
    name of beauty originally and strictly applicable to visible objects in reference
    to certain of the feelings which the cognition of them awakens has been currently
    extended in our philosophical and critical literature so as to embrace all varieties
    of this contemplative pleasure immediately consequent on an act of imagination
    if we were to attempt accounting fully for the rise of such imaginative pleasures
    we should be thrown back gradually on the question as to the origin of pleasure
    generally  and this inquiry would issue in the theory which determines all pleasure
    to arise out of the consciousness of mental activity exerted on objects which
    neither confine nor overstrain it among the many specific modifications however
    which this law receives and which must be brought to light before the theory can
    be applied to any given case there is one which as being operative widely and
    incessantly both in persuasion and in poetical representation has for us great
    value the modification alluded to is yielded by the great law of sympathy expressible
    with small alteration in the words of adam smith the mind has a tendency to experience
    feelings which it perceives to be manifested by others it is not here needed to
    propose the problem whether this strong and beneficent tendency be an ultimate
    law of mind or whether it may be resolved into laws still simpler and deeper the
    law must be accepted in the shape in which we know it to be operative and in the
    later stages of our inquiry it will seldom be far out of our view the laws  the
    theory of cognition supplying the data for inferof cogniences in ontology or metaphysics
    proper is the favourite battlefield of philosophical controversy with the more
    imatrinap rooun f i e analytic problems raised in it we are not tiou and i ei
    e r ect ly concerned the theory of comparative judgconception ment again though
    we require to use it in some degree is supplied by any reasonably correct system
    of logic what we cannot command so readily while we need it especially is a clear
    and consistent theory of imagination  and even of the kind of cognitive facts
    so named the character cannot be fully elucidated without some consideration of
    its relations to other phases of intellection the widest of all distinctions within
    the sphere of cognition is that which the logicians mark by the two names apprehension
    and judgment every fact of knowledge must have the one or the other of the forms
    so called no such fact can have both or neither judgment that is data for cognition
    expressible by a proposition is knowledge explitheories of cit evolved complete
    in the proposition something is literature affirmed or denied of something apprehension
    that is v an cognition expressible by a term is knowledge implied unevolved incomplete  in
    the term there is neither affirmation nor denial yet the idea denoted by the term
    implies or involves judgment antecedent while it may also be a step towards judgment
    consequent when the names apprehension and judgment are used in these logical
    meanings it might seem at first sight as if the difference between the mental
    facts which they denote were purely subjective we might believe that our knowledge
    of any object whatever may take indifferently either the one form or the other
    closer scrutiny removes this impression mental affirmations guarded by the relative
    denials lie at the root of all cognition  and this is saying in other words that
    all knowledge takes its rise in the form of judgment accordingly this formal distinction
    affects the next widest of the distinctions between modes of cognition that which
    separates knowledge immediate from knowledge mediate the former is the root of
    all our knowledge  the latter grows out of it in the former the only object known
    is something which is present and which is the immediate object of our consciousness
    in the latter this immediate object represents another object which is remote
    not present but which is known through the medium of the first between those two
    kinds of knowledge there is a formal difference every fact of knowledge immediateevery
    fact in which consciousness gives us knowledge of a present object and does not
    rest in that confused state which is really no more than feelingmust have the
    form of judgment neither the complex fact as a whole nor any of its constitutive
    elements can be thought otherwise than as a mental affirmation or denial knowledge
    mediate on the contrary may have either form the alternative however being determined
    by the circumstances judgment as being knowledge complete and explicit is the
    form which mediate knowledge takes when it is contemplated as being a result as
    that for the sake of which antecedent processes were instituted while apprehension
    as being knowledge implied and therefore more quickly thinkable is the natural
    form ofknowledge which is contemplated as only a step towards something beyond
    it whether that be a further cognition or a fact belonging to some other mode
    these considerations dictate as convenient if not perfectly exact a distribution
    of cognitions in which knowledge immediate may be considered exclusively under
    the form of judgment while knowledge mediate must be considered under both forms
    i our immediate cognitions those intuitive beliefs on which the whole structure
    of human knowledge is built up are of individual objects only this cardinal doctrine
    being premised all those deeper questions that lie under it are for us unimportant
    nevertheless some of them must be answered in outline if it were only that we
    may be put in possession of names for mental laws which must afterwards be referred
    to our immediate knowledge then is constituted in every possible instance by elements
    of two kinds we know objects not absolutely but under conditions or relations
    we have knowledge a posteriorithat is gained through experience a knowledge vast
    and always becoming wider but this knowledge is limited by a few fixed cognitions
    a priori necessary as being independent of experience and constituting the laws
    or conditions of all d posteriori knowledge whether immediate or mediate the individual
    objects of our immediate knowledge must be either corporeal objects or internal
    phenomena of the subjectmind  but our knowledge of objects of either kind is not

    in the kingdom of valencia in  his parents were poor  but no poverty could prevent
    him from studying art while he was still very young he managed to place himself
    in the school of francisco rlbalta not long afterwards he was found in the streets
    of rome a ragged boy copying the frescoes on the outside of the public buildings
    a benevolent cardinal took him into his house but the wayward  little spaniard
    soon returned to his vagrant habits of study he begged his way to parma and modena
    to examine the masterpieces of coreggio on his return to rome he pawned his cloak
    and with the money set out to try his fortune in naples ribera had not long settled
    in naples before he began to achieve great success assuming the severely truthful
    manner of caravaggio he employed his brush on sacred subjects with striking effect
    his stern prophets and apostles with their gaunt and shrivelled faces and his
    tortured martyrs with their agonized features and mutilated limbs soon rivetted
    the public attention and procured him many patrons an admiring picturedealer gave
    him the hand of his lovely and welldowered daughter the viceroy don pedro giron
    made him the court painter with a handsome salary there was scarcely one of his
    sackclothgirt st jeromes and his arrowpierced st sebastians which did not find
    a ready purchaser among the churchmen he rapidly rose towards the highest rank
    of neapolitan artists nor did he hesitate to use villainous stratagems to accelerate
    his promotion forming a conspiracy with two other unprincipled painters he employed
    every malicious art to force his rivals off the field d arpino guido gessi and
    domenichino were all in turn driven from the city and not until his accomplices
    had died did he cease to cheat and bully for preeminence the iniquitous life of
    ribera is said to have come to a dismal close in the midst of the heyday of his
    opulence and fame his daughter was seduced by don juan of austria the proud painter
    broken down with shame hid his head in privacy at length one day he disappeared
    from his house and was never heard of more riberas pictures are in great repute
    especially among the spaniards and italians in italy his best works are to be
    found at naples and include  st jerome startled by the last trump  silenus and

    political economist since adam smith was the third of a numerous family and was
    born in the city of london on the th of april  his father a native of holland
    and of the jewish persuasion settled in this country early in life he is said
    to have been a man of good talents and the strictest integrity  and having become
    a member of the stock exchange he acquired a respectable fortune and possessed
    considerable influence in his circle david was destined for the same line of business
    as his father and received partly in england and partly at a school in holland
    where he resided two years such an education as is usually given to young men
    intended for the mercantile profession r i c classical learning formed no part
    of his early instruction ricardo he began to be confidentially employed by his
    father in the business of the stock exchange when he was only fourteen years of
    age neither then however nor at any subsequent period was he wholly engrossed
    by the combinations and details of his profession from his earliest years he evinced
    a taste for abstract and general reasoning and manifested that determination to
    probe every subject of interest to the bottom and to form his opinion upon it
    according to the conviction of his mind which was a distinguishing feature of
    his character mr ricardo senior had been accustomed to subscribe without investigation
    to the opinions of his ancestors on all questions connected with religion and
    politics and he was desirous that his children should do the same but this system
    of passive obedience and blind submission to the dictates of authority was quite
    repugnant to the principles of young ricardo who though he did not fail to testify
    the sincerest affection and respect for his father found reason to differ from
    him on many important points and even to secede from the hebrew faith not long
    after this event and shortly after he attained the age of majority ricardo formed
    a matrimonial union productive of much domestic happiness but his marriage being
    disapproved of by his father it occasioned with the change in his religion a breach
    between them being thus thrown wholly on his own resources he commenced business
    for himself at this important epoch of his history the oldest and most respectable
    members of the stock exchange gave a striking proof of the high esteem entertained
    by them for his talents and the integrity of his character by voluntarily coming
    forward to support him in his undertakings fi is success exceeded the most sanguine
    expectations of his friends and in a few years he realized an ample fortune  the
    talent for obtaining wealth says a near relation of ricardos from whose interesting
    account of his life we have borrowed these particulars  is not held in much estimation  but
    perhaps in nothing did ricardo more evince his extraordinary powers than he did
    in his business his  complete knowledge of all its intricacies his surprising
    quickness at figures and calculation  his capability of getting through without
    any apparent exertion the immense transactions in which he was concerned  his
    coolness and judgment combined certainly with for him a fortunate tissue of public
    events enabled him to leave all his contemporaries at the stock exchange far behind
    and to raise himself infinitely higher not only in fortune but in general character
    and estimation than any man had ever done before in that house such was the impression
    which these qualities had made on his competitors that several of the most discerning
    among them long before he had emerged into public notoriety prognosticated in
    their admiration that he would live to fill some of the highest stations in the
    state  according as his solicitude about his success in life declined ricardo
    began to devote a greater portion of his time to scientific and literary pursuits
    when about twentyfive years of age he began to study some branches of mathematical
    science and made considerable progress in chemistry and mineralogy he fitted up
    a laboratory formed a collection of minerals and was one of the original members
    of the geological society it is known however that he never entered warmly into
    the investigation of these sciences they were not adapted to the peculiar cast
    of his mind and he abandoned them entirely as soon as his attention was directed
    to the more congenial study of political economy he is stated to have made his
    first acquaintance with the see an account of the life of ricardo in the annual
    obituary for  supposed to be written by one of his brothers

    loved to relax over these familiar and inexpensive meetings and the late lord

    us before robertson had become one of the celebrities of the scottish capital
    he had engaged in historical researches sitting in his quiet manse at gladsmuir
    in october  we find him writing to lord hailes for information and books relative
    to the history of scotland as he intended to employ some of the idle time of that
    winter in making diligent inquiry into the period between the death of king james
    v and the death of queen mary in  he published his only printed sermon a discourse
    preached before the society for promoting christian knowledge and entitled the
    situation of the world at the time of christs appearance and its connection with

    manifested and the sermon is as carefully and finely written and as well reasoned
    as any of his subsequent great works in  robertson took an active part in defending
    some of his clerical friends from the persecution raised against them by the high
    calvinistic party of the church on account of homes tragedy ot douglas that a
    presbyterian clergyman should write a play was held to be a glaring scandal and
    outrage and the offence was aggravated by the circumstance that several of his
    brother ministers had been present at the representation of the tragedy in edinburgh
    robertson was not of the number he had early promised to his father that he would
    never enter a playhouse  and though he rejoiced in the success of his friends

    henderson he faithfully kept his promise home bent before the clerical storm by
    resigning his living at athelstaneford and most of the other clergymen having
    apologised and explained were sentenced by their various presbyteries to short
    periods of suspension or were only subjected to a rebuke the pleas of alleviation
    put in by some of the offending ministers are amusingly characteristic mr white
    of libberton owned the charge but pleaded that he had gone to the playhouse only
    once and endeavoured to conceal himself in a corner to avoid giving offence the
    presbytery suspended him from the th of january to the d of february mr steel
    minister of stair urged in extenuation that the playhouse was at a great distance
    from his parish and he had no reason to apprehend that he would be known not one
    of the ministers dared to justify his conduct in attending the theatre and all
    were much indebted to robertson for the robertson judgment and eloquence with
    which he conducted their defence the incident is both an interesting and important
    one in the history of the scottish church  and it served to bring more prominently
    into notice the talents and principles of the rising minister of gladsmuir he
    was honoured with the degree of doctor of divinity by the university of edinburgh
    and in  was appointed incumbent of lady testers parish in edinburgh by this time

    luminous and picturesque of a most interesting and complicated portion of history
    it has perhaps never been excelled the style is too uniformly stately and measured

    the arrangement of incidentsin moral reflection acute remark and sustained dignity
    of thought and chaste embellishment the work must ever rank in the first class
    of historical compositions and will ever enchain the attention of the reader the
    story of mary queen of scots is told with inimitable grace and pathos  and although
    the views of robertson have been assailed by eager and determined controversialists
    no substantial deviation from the truth of history has been discovered in his

    on the sunday dr priestley was charmed with his conversation but confessed himself
    much disappointed with his preaching  his discourse dr priestley said  was unconnected
    and desultory and his manner of treating the trinity favoured rather of burlesque
    than of serious reasoning he attacked orthodoxy more pointedly and sarcastically
    than i ever did in my life he had often expressed a wish  to die softly suddenly
    and alone on tuesday the th of june the very day on which he had intended to proceed

    john a distinguished professor of natural philosophy born in  at boghall in the
    parish of baldernock and county of stirling was a younger son of john robison
    esq who had formerly been a merchant at glasgow and had retired to live in considerable
    affluence on his estate at boghall not far from that city he was of a family sufficiently
    respectable to enable his son at a subsequent period to prove himself to the satisfaction
    of the court of st petersburg  gentleman born as a younger brother that son was
    originally intended for the church and went at an early age according to the custom
    of scotland in  to enter as a student in the university of glasgow so that he
    was initiated almost in the rudiments of grecian literature under the able instruction
    of dr moor the wellknown professor of greek and he acquired such a knowledge of
    the classical languages as served to constitute him a correct scholar through
    life he pursued his studies with so much attention as to obtain the approbation
    of his teachers and the admiration of his contemporaries who were delighted with
    the originality and ingenuity of his conversation though he did not himself reflect
    with perfect satisfaction upon the degree of application which he had exerted
    in his academical education he took the degree of master of arts in  having studied
    mathematics under dr robert simson and moral philosophy under dr adam smith the
    example of so correct and rigid a follower of the ancient methods of rob  demonstration
    as dr simson must unquestionably have exercised considerable influence on his
    yet unformed taste in mathematics  but he seems to have had a natural preference
    either from the constitution of his mind or from some previously acquired habits
    of thinking for the geometrical method for we are informed that  he first attracted
    the regard of dr simson by owning his dislike of algebra and by returning a neat
    geometrical solution of a problem which had been given out to the class in an
    algebraical form with this mode of solution the professor was delighted though
    the pupil candidly acknowledged that it had been adopted only because he could
    not solve the problem in the manner required of the class in the course of his
    studies he had imbibed an insuperable aversion to the pursuit of his original
    objects in the church  not certainly from any want of religious feeling or from
    a dislike to the kind of life that was intended for him but probably from some
    difficulties that had occurred to him respecting particular points of doctrine
    or of practice he was therefore compelled to provide himself with some other occupation  and
    he readily accepted the offer of some of his friends in  to recommend him to dr
    blair a prebendary of westminster who had formed a scheme for sending prince edward
    the young duke of york to complete his professional education at sea in company
    with a son of admiral knowles  and robison was to have instructed his royal highness
    in mathematics and navigation on his arrival in london he was much disappointed
    to find that the expedition had never been seriously intended and he readily accepted
    an engagement to attend young knowles as a private tutor when he went as a midshipman
    on board of the neptune of ninety guns with admiral saunders who had the command
    of a force intended to cooperate with general wolfe in the reduction of quebec  and
    upon the appointment of his friend as a lieutenant on board of the royal william
    robison was himself rated as a midshipman in that ship the fleet arrived on the
    coast of america in april  in may they got up the river and robison was one of
    a party of  seamen draughted from the royal william into the admirals ship under
    the command of lieutenant knowles in this capacity he had an opportunity of seeing
    considerable service and of making some surveys of the river and of the neighbouring
    country  an employment for which he was perfectly qualified both as a geometrician
    and a draughtsman he also remarked the effect of the aurora borealis on the compass
    which had been noticed by marian and wargentin some years before but which was
    then not commonly known after the battle which was signalized by the victory and
    death of the gallant wolfe the royal william sailed with his body to europe and
    arrived at spithead in november the next year she was sent to cruise off cape
    finisterre  but in six months she was obliged to return home from having the greater
    part of the men disabled by the scurvy he used to consider the two years that
    he spent on board of the royal william as the happiest of his life and no inconsiderable
    part of his gratification was derived from the study of seamanship as he saw it
    practised under the auspices of captain hugh pigot he did not however acquire
    any firm attachment to the mode of life which he had temporarily adopted  he was
    rather disposed to resume his academical pursuits and he had overcome his earlier
    objections to the ecclesiastical profession he could not however refuse the kindly
    invitation of admiral knowles to come and live with him in the country and to
    assist him in some important experiments which he was making upon mechanical and
    nautical subjects in the month of february  lieutenant knowles was appointed to
    the peregrine sloop of twenty guns and robison accompanied him with the hope of

    father to withdraw from the church of england and become a member of the presbyterian
    church at newington of which dr price was the pastor price though described by
    his adversary burke as  a man much connected with literary caballers and intriguing
    philosophers with political theologians and theological politicians was eloquent
    courteous and polished in his manners  and to this dissenting connection the poet
    was indebted for his introduction to many of the eminent whig politicians and
    men of rank whom he was afterwards proud to number among his friends in mature
    life he did not care to rank with the dissenters  but he never abjured the association
    and the last note in his poem of italy tells us that his original ms of the poem
    contained these lines   what though his ancestors early or late were not ennobled
    by the breath of kings yet in his veins was running at his birth the blood of
    those most eminent of old for wisdom virtuethose who could renounce the things
    of this world for their conscience sake and die like blessed martyrs  mr rogers
    was educated at the newington green academy then taught by a dr burgh author of
    a treatise on the dignity of human nature oneof his schoolfellows was mr william
    maltby a modest and retired scholar who succeeded porson as librarian to the london
    institution and lived to the age of ninety enjoying the friendship of the poet
    the latter was fond of relating that one day he and maltby while walking up fleet
    street resolved on visiting johnson in bolt court and introducing themselves to
    the great literary dictator  but when rogers hand w r as  on the knocker of the
    door his heart failed him and the young aspirants withdrew boswell to whom many
    years afterwards mr rogers related the circumstance said truly  why did you not
    go boldly in  he would have received you with all kindness and such no doubt would
    have been the result johnson never appeared to greater advantage than when giving
    advice and counselling his young and diffident admirers the first ambition of
    rogers was to be a preachera second dr price  but his father placed him in his
    own bankinghouse preparatory to his being admitted as a partner he read gray and
    goldsmith as lie walked to and from the bank in cornhill yet when he ventured
    on authorship his first appearance was in prose he contributed a series of essays
    entitled the scribbler to that venerable repository of fugitive literature the
    gentleman s magazine this was in  when rogers was in his eighteenth year the essays
    are in the usual formal didactic style of that period and are neatly written in  he
    published his ode to superstition tvith some other poewspaying down a sum of l
    to the publisher to secure him from loss  and the precaution was not unneeded
    as at the end of four years only about twenty copies of the e r s work is d each
    were sold the monthly review howrogers ever recognised in the crude imitations
    of gray and diyden  the hand of an able master and rogers confessed that this
    praise was the first stimulant to his ambition in  he visited edinburgh travelling
    on horseback and was introduced to adam smith blair robertson and henry mackenzie
    he afterwards regretted that he had not rode on to ellisland to visit burns but
    some of his edinburgh friends he said dissuaded him from the journey part of  he
    spent in paris and the year following his return witnessed his advent as a successful
    poet his pleasures of memory appeared in  at first anonymously but the author
    becoming known he was feted and applauded what pleasure i felt he said on being
    told that este parson este had said of me  a child of goldsmith sir  este was
    one of the royal chaplains an author and a proprietor of the morning post and
    world newspapers he was an authority in fashionable circles and his favourable
    award must have appeared fame in this instance mr este was right the pleasures
    of memory belong to the school of goldsmith the versification the pensive vein
    of reflection the concise select imagery and description show that the poet had
    carefully studied the traveller and deserted villagesuperadding however a strain
    of subtle and refined thought with historic and classic allusions which peculiarly
    mark the poetry of rogers  his elegance is really wonderful said byron   there
    is no such thing as a vulgar line in his book it must be admitted however that
    there are several feeble lines in the poem with a few halfformed pictures and
    passages which recall the more vigorous and fervent inspiration of older masters

    measure from the bankinghouseleavingthemanagementtoa younger brother about the
    same time he removed from newington green to apartments in the temple which he
    furnished with great elegance his taste in all matters relating to social life
    may be seen from his epistle to a friend printed with a few other poems in  in
    his rooms in the temple the poet lived till about the year  when he removed to
    a house in st jamess place looking into the green park this housethe celebrated

    his death were dispersed after a sale of twentytwo days producing upwards of l
    mere wealth could not have amassed such a collection  it was the result of taste
    and knowledge combined with the judicious expenditure of money at the right time
    and constant vigilance in watching the proper opportunity some of those treasures

  text: h u m e hume quiesced in after life in his first early conclusionsthe very
    david immaturity of which might well have awakened suspicion there is no proof
    that when he became a man in intellect he ever seriously revolved them again he
    must also be blamed for the resolute way in which he evaded or silenced every
    attempt to turn his mind to the reconsideration of his opinions a remarkable instance
    of this disposition to get rid of expostulation occurs in one of his letters to
    blair cited by mr burton  whenever says hume  i have had the pleasure to be in
    your company if the discourse turned on any common subject of literature or reasoning
    i always parted from you both entertained and instructed but when the conversation
    was diverted by you from this channel towards the subject of your professionthough
    i doubt not but your intentions were friendly towards mei own i never received
    the same satisfaction  i was apt to be tired and you to be angry i would therefore
    wish for the future whenever my good fortune throws me in your way that these
    topics should be forborne between us i have long since done with all inquiries
    on such subjects and am become incapable of receiving instruction blairs letter
    by the way shows that humes scottish clerical admirers did not hesitate to embrace
    opportunities of faithful expostulation as far as humes repellent humour permitted
    and proves how unjust and uncharitable the suspicions which were sometimes founded
    on the intimacy between him and them a mans christianity would be equivocally
    evinced by renouncing all intercourse with such as renounce it such conduct would
    suggest to those thus repelled a strange idea of the charity which professed to
    seek their spiritual welfare  it were rather to be desired that every hume or
    gibbon might have for his bosom friend a bishop butler or a robert hall of the
    personal and social elements of humes character it is unnecessary to say anything
    as the subject has been so admirably touched by sir james mackintosh in his preliminary
    dissertation that he was very amiable and well merited the admiration of his friends
    cannot be doubted though the eulogy of adam smith uttered in the first freshness
    of grief at his loss is as sir james observes  an affectionate exaggeration  such
    a praise he justly says can never be earned without passing through either of
    the extremes of fortune without standing the test of temptations dangers and sacrifices
    it may be said with truth the private character of mr hume exhibited all the virtues
    which a man of reputable station under a mild government in the quiet times of
    a civilized country has often the opportunity to practise in certain respects
    hume presented rather a curious contrast he was by no means the impassive person
    his general coldness of temperament would lead us to conclude and by no means
    the unprejudiced person which a sceptical philosophy may be presumed to have a
    tendency to form and which he would fain be thought where his solitary  passionliterary
    ambitionwas in question his vanity is as hume impatient exacting and querulous
    as that of any mortal i avld in spite of constantly brightening prospects and
    widening v nt fame he is perpetually harping about imaginary neglect and imaginary
    persecution similarly as to prejudice his bitterness against the english  will
    just match and no more than match with johnsons bitterness against the scotch
    in these two men the two nations may justly consider themselves quits and fortunately
    are never likely to have any more such absurd accounts to settle between them
    it is the happiness of our age that englishmen would as little tolerate the prejudices
    of johnson as scotchmen would thoseof humebut it is in his historical writings
    that humes intense capacity of prejudice appears most signally he who was the
    most sceptical of philosophers became in fact the most bigoted of historians  with
    this aggravation of his bigotry howeverthat all the acts and opinions of which
    in his history he was so keen an apologist were in direct defiance of the general
    strain of his political sentiments and speculations as disclosed in his political
    essays as to his character as a philosopher his genius will probably be more appreciated
    and its achievements less valued by successive generations of readers his capacity
    cannot be well exaggerated that such a work as the treatise of human nature or
    the essays should have proceeded from so young a man gives an impression of subtlety
    acuteness and ingenuity seldom if ever surpassed but these productions are chiefly
    remarkable as proofs of his genius and for the searching investigations to which
    they led on the part of others  not for their intrinsic value system as both stewart
    and mackintosh observe he had none  he is constantly shifting his ground and contradictions
    without number may be detected in his writings the fact is that provided he coidd
    find any arguments to support the paradox of scepticism which happened to be the
    theme of one essay he did not care how it might be opposed to some other paradox
    of scepticism which was defended in another essay thus while speculatively arguing
    that neither  intuition demonstration experience nor any other conceivable reason
    really authorizes us to conclude that any one sequence will follow any one antecedent
    rather than another or that the future will resemble the past he in his essay
    on miracles declares all  miracles utterly incredible  because they would contradict
    the uniformity of nature as ascertained by experience f  ambitious to outdo berkeleybyannihilating
    not only matter but mind and reducing every thing in the universe to  impressions
    and ideas he abundantly contradicts himself but here to be sure he could not help
    it by saying in the same breath that of the existence of these impressions and
    ideas even scepticism cannot doubt since wethat is the doubted conscious unity
    mindcannot but be conscious of them  similarly while affirming consistently enough
    in words all his lite long his belief in an intelligent first cause and it is
    the only determinate religious  thus he speaks of the english in   that nation
    are relapsing fast into the deepest stupidity and ignorance the taste for literature
    is neither decayed nor depraved here as with the barbarians on the banks of the
    thames    can you seriously talk of my continuing an englishman  am i or are you
    an englishman do they not treat with derision our pretensions to that name and
    with hatred our just pretensions to surpass and govern them     i have a reluctance
    to think of settling among the factious barbarians of london who will hate me
    because i am a scotsman and am not a whig and despise me because  am a man of
    letters    it is lamentable to think how much that nation has declined in literature
    in our time  this inconsistency with his speculative principles is the least defect
    in that acute but sophistical performance but its fallacies have been too often
    pointed out to need being mentioned here   for all inferences from experience
    suppose as their foundation that the future will resemble the past and that similar
    powers will be conjoined with similar sensible qualities if there be any suspicion
    that the course of nature may change and that the past may be no rule for the
    future all experience becomes useless and can give rise to no inference or conclusion
    it is impossible therefore that any arguments from experience can prove this resemblance
    of the past to the future  since all these arguments are founded on the supposition
    of that resemblance let the course of things be allowed hitherto ever so regular

  text: p r i primogenithe custom of primogeniture seems even to have oeen more ture
    severe towards females than among the jews if the father died without heirsmale
    of h  s body and without a will the nearest kinsman on the fathers side was entitled
    to claim the estate to the exclusion of any daughters whom he had left if he had
    made a will it should have bequeathed his estates to parties bound to marry his
    daughters the mohammedans held that females should inherit a certain portion of
    whatever their fathers might leave allowing the males a double portion among the
    romans a somewhat different policy seems to have prevailed at all events it was
    not till the time of justinian that daughters v were placed exactly on the same
    footing as sons with respect to the succession to intestate property the germanic
    nations generally with the single exception of the visigoths gave a decided preference
    to heirsmale in regard especially to the succession to land females were occasionally
    excluded from succession to the inheritance under any circumstances and in the
    case where they were more favourably treated it was almost invariably on their
    having no brothers the custom of gavelkind which still prevails in kent seems
    to have existed previous to the conquest and most probably extended over the larger
    portion of england and wales by this custom lands within the county of kent unless
    specially excepted by an act of the legislature descend where the father dies
    intestate leaving sons and daughters in equal portions to the sons to the exclusion
    of the daughters  but in the event of his leaving daughters only they share the
    property equally among themselves this law still exists in the copyholds of the
    manors of stepney and hackney in middlesex and in a few other places beyond the
    bounds of kent the custom of borough english by which the youngest son succeeds
    to the whole of the inheritance on the intestacy of the father has prevailed in
    stamford and one or two other places time immemorial the same custom still exists
    as to copyholds in different parts of england but whether previous to the conquest
    property descended to the sons or indifferently to both sons and daughters the
    introduction of the feudal system led to a change in the succession to property
    in land and paved the way for the universal introduction of the custom of primogeniture
    some writers have taken a very unfavourable view of the influence exercised by
    this custom in modern times adam smith says  nothing can be more contrary to the
    real interest of a numerous family than a right which in order to enrich one beggars
    all the rest of the children wealth of nations by mculloeh p  but however apparently
    reasonable or however well supported this opinion may be we are of opinion that
    it has really no good foundation how much of the enterprise and industry of the
    superior wealth and civilization of modern europe may be ascribed to the influence
    of the custom of primogeniture  it is beyond a doubt that the possession from
    infancy of a competency is of all others the most powerful obstacle to energy
    and enterprise those so situated seldom seek any kind of honourable distinction
    and fold their hands in contentment with the humble mediocrity which has fallen
    to their lot it is not to be expected that the monied fortunes accumulated for
    the younger children should equal those of the elder brother if they be furnished
    with the means of establishing themselves in a profession the capacity to rise
    is put into their handsi the sense of inferiority will stimulate them to exertion
    and inspire them with a determination to rise to the same or even to a higher
    level it is no rule for the division of property in land to tell us that merchants
    bankers and others of that class divide their property equally among tie different
    members of their families without any bad t ects resulting from it such parties
    may carry on the p r i business in partnership as advantageously as their fatherprimum
    the children of a landed proprietor can with great difficulty mobile do this the
    views of the coheirs so different and conp  ii flicting are generally found to
    be all but insurmountable yvle add to this that the custom of primogeniture provides
    for island the cultivation of all that is most elevated in art in litev rature
    and in scienceof everything in a word that communicates splendour and gives an
    enduring celebrity to nations while doing so it imbues all classes with the spirit
    of industry and enterprise it does not appear therefore that the objections raised
    against the custom of primogeniture are entitled to any considerable notice it
    is not imperative it is a custom only and not a right and may be defeated in the
    event of the misconduct of the eldest son the personal property of one dying intestate
    shall by this rule be dividedafter the widows proportion is deductedequally among
    all the children  but that the real estate shall go in addition to the eldest
    son there is one respect in which the english law of intestacy stands much in
    need of revision the personal property of the intestate is the first fund for
    their debts although secured upon their estates and it is the surplus only if
    there be any that is divisible among the children this is in all respects a most
    objectionable arrangement when an estate is burdened to its full value the eldest
    son should have nothing to look to save his share of the personal property this
    is in accordance with the law of scotland in that country if the eldest son take
    the real he gets no part of the personal estate he is permitted to renounce the

    effected by the congress of vienna whereby besides the loss of the duchy of warsaw
    an area of  square miles with a population of  was ceded to prussia to make up
    to that kingdom for its part of poland which russia obtained notwithstanding this
    spoliation of more than half its territory saxony has since risen to a more flourishing
    and prosperous condition than ever frederick august i as king died in  having
    deservedly obtained the surname of the just and was succeeded by his brother anthony
    who carried on the various measures of reform which his predecessor had begun
    in the later years of his reign still the people suffered under many grievances
    and had as yet very little share in the legislative power the outbreaks which
    took place in  in dresden and leipzig did not indeed cause any serious disturbance
    but they led to the introduction of a new constitution in the following year on
    the death of the king in  his nephew frederick august ii who had been regent since  ascended
    the throne the constitutional system now established did not succeed altogether
    in the best possible way a powerful party was formed in opposition to the government
    and in the year  violent contests began in which the opposition gradually gained
    the upper hand the chief points in dispute were the freedom of the press and the
    publicity of judicial proceedings the government followed the fatal policy of
    delaying to yield as long as possible so that the concessions which would in  have
    been received with universal joy were granted in  without any effect an attack
    was made in leipzig in  upon prince john the heirapparent and having been put
    down by the military led to a still more violent opposition on the part of the
    popular party the ministry however still held their ground during the stormy session
    of  but were at last compelled to resign in march  when a liberal cabinet was
    formed various changes were introduced in the following year especially with regard
    to the mode of electing the legislature but these were not of long continuance

  text: political political the subordinate parts of the science of political economy
    economy have been treated in separate articles of this work with the fulness which
    their importance seemed to require i he present article therefore will be principally
    confined to an attempt to define the objects and limits of the science to trace
    its progressto exhibit and establish the fundamental principles on which it is
    foundedand to point out the relation and dependence of its different parts in
    doing this we shall have occasion to examine some of the more prominent theories
    advanced in this field of inquiry  our object being not merely to lay before the
    reader what we conceive to be a true theory of the science but also to present
    him with as full an exposition as our limits will allow of the doctrines advocated
    by the more celebrated of its professors part i definition and history definition

    economy definition political economy  is the science of the laws which reguof
    the late the production distribution and consumption of the science products and
    services necessary useful or agreeable to man which it requires some portion of
    voluntary labour to  produce procure or preserve this definition has been framed
    so as to exclude all reference to whatever exists independently of man and may
    be obtained in unlimited quantities without any laborious exertion had such been
    the case with the various articles required to satisfy our wants and desires political
    economy would not have existed it is the most practical of sciences for it is
    exclusively conversant with the application the objects and the results of art
    and industry it may indeed be said to be the science of values inasmuch as those
    things only which may be exchanged or bartered for other things that are either
    wholly or in part produced by means of voluntary exertion or labour come within
    the scope of its inquiries an article may be possessed of the highest degree of
    utility or as it is sometimes termed of intrinsic worth and yet be wholly destitute
    of value in exchange without utility of some sort or other nothing can ever become
    an object of desire or demand but however necessary an article may be to our comfort
    or even existence and however much it may be in demand still if it be a spontaneous
    production of nature if it exist independently of human agency and if every individual
    have an indefinite command over it it cannot become the subject of an exchange
    or afford any basis for the reasonings of the economist t hough food and clothes
    are not more useful than atmospheric air they possess that value of which it is
    destitute the reason is obvious they are not like air gratuitous products which
    may be had at all times without any exertion  they are obtainable only by labour
    and as none will voluntarily sacrifice the fruits of their industry without an
    economy equivalent they are truly said to possess exchangeable definition worth
    the word value is we are aware very often employed distinction to express the
    utility as well as the exchangeable worth of between articles but as these qualities
    have nothing in common value in this double employment had better be avoided it
    is obexchange vious for example that the utility of bread and water or and utl  their
    capacity to appease hunger and quench thirst is something fundamentally different
    from their value or capacity to exchange for or buy other things adam smith perceived
    this difference and was alive to the importance of carefully distinguishing between
    the utility or as he expressed it the  value in use of commodities and their value
    in exchange but he did not always keep this distinction in view and it has been
    frequently lost sight of by later writers there can indeed be no doubt that the
    confounding of these opposite qualities has been a principal cause of the confusion
    and obscurity in which many branches of the science not in themselves difficult
    are still involved when it is said that water is highly valuable it is meant that
    being indispensable to existence it has a high degree of utility or of value in
    use  for being usually obtainable in large quantities with little labour or exertion
    it has in most places a very low value in exchange but when it is said that gold
    is highly valuable a totally different meaning is attached to the phrase gold
    is of comparatively small utility but as it requires a great deal of labour and
    expense to bring limited quantities of it to market it has a high value in exchange
    and is readily accepted as an equivalent for large quantities of most other articles
    to confound qualities which are so very different must evidently lead to erroneous
    conclusions and therefore to avoid all chance of error from mistaking the sense
    of so important a word as value we shall not use it except to signify exchangeable
    worth or value in exchange and shall employ the word utility to express the power
    or fitness of an article to satisfy our wants and desires were utility and value
    identical or were they regulated by the same laws it would follow that whatever
    increased the utility of an article would also increase its value and vice versa
    but the fact is completely the reverse a deficient harvest adds nothing to the
    utilitythat is to the nutritive powerof bread  while by increasing its value and
    price it adds to the privations of the great bulk of the consumers and especially
    to those of the lower and poorer and most numerous classes and so in every case
    a xise of value or price is always publicly injurious  and conversely were the
    manufacture of hats improved so that they might be sold for half their present
    price everybody would gain by the change those by whom they have been worn would
    save half their outlay upon them while they would be brought within the reach
    of others who may hitherto have been too poor to become their purchasers the discovery
    of the rules or principles by the application of which the value of commodities
    may be reduced to the lowest limits is a principal object of this science for
    the more their value is reduced the more obtainable they become and the greater
    consequently is the amount of necessaries and conveniences at the disposal of
    individuals political economy has frequently been defined to be  the definition
    science which treats of the production distribution and conof tle tenl  economy

  text: political economy definition sumption of wealth and if by wealth were meant
    those products which possess exchangeable value and are necessary useful or agreeable
    the definition would be one of the least exceptionable but those by whom it has
    been adopted have given to wealth a different and in general much too extensive
    a meaning they have sometimes for example considered it as synonymous with  all
    that man desires as useful and agreeable but if political economy were to embrace
    a discussion of the production and distribution of whatever is useful and agreeable
    it would include within itself every other science and the best encyclopaedia
    would be the best treatise on political economy good health is the greatest of
    boons and therefore on this hypothesis the science of wealth should comprise the
    science of medicine  civil and religious liberty are highly desirable and therefore
    the science of wealth should comprise the science of politics and so on such definitions
    are obviously worse than useless they generate confused and erroneous notions
    respecting the objects and limits of the science and prevent the student acquiring
    a distinct idea of the nature of the inquiries in which he is engaged malthus
    defined wealth to consist of  those material objects which are necessary useful
    and agreeable to man principles of political economy p  but waiving the objections
    that may perhaps be made to the introduction of the word  material it is too comprehensive
    to be of use atmospheric air and the heat of the sun aie both material products
    and are highly useful and agreeable but their independent existence and incapacity
    of appropriation exclude them as already seen from the investigations of this
    science adam smith has not explicitly stated what was the meaning which he attached
    to the term wealth probably indeed his ideas on the subject were not very precise
    but he most commonly describes it as the annual produce of land and labour it
    has however been objected to this definition that it refers to the sources of
    wealth before it is known what wealth is and that it includes the useless products
    of the earth as well as those which are appropriated and enjoyed by man i he definition
    we have given is not open to any of these objections by confining the science
    to a discussion of the laws which regulate  the production distribution and consumption
    of those products and services which have exchangeable value and are necessary
    useful or agreeable we give it a distinct and definite object when thus propel
    ly restricted the researches of the economist occupy a held whicftc js exclusively
    his own he runs no risk of wasting libvtime in inquiries which belong to other
    sciences or in unprofitable investigations respecting the production and consumption
    of articles which cannot be appropriated and exist independently of human agency
    capacity of appropriation is indispensable to constitute wealth and we shall invariably
    employ this term to distinguish those products which are obtainable only by the
    intervention of human labour and which may in consequence be appropriated and
    consumed exclusively by their owners a man is not said to be wealthy because he
    has an indefinite command over atmospheric air for that being a privilege which
    he enjoys in common with every one else it forms no ground of distinction but
    he is said to be wealthy according to the degree in which tie can afford to command
    those necessaries conveniences and luxuries which are not the gifts of nature
    but the produce of industry it must however be carefully observed that though
    value and wealth be constantly conjoined they are not identical but are as widely
    different as utility and value our command of the necessaries and gratifica tions
    of which wealth consists will evidently be greater definition when their value
    declines than when it increases it  is a law of this science that wealth and value
    vary inverselyhet one increasing as the other diminishes and diminishing as the
    other increases wealth is greatest where the facility of production is greatest
    and value is greatest under the opposite circumstances or where the difficulty
    of production is greatest besides being exclusively conversant with that class
    of importphenomena which the exertion of industry exhibits the ance i object of
    this science is to ascertain the means by which tte science  the latter may be
    rendered most productive of the necessaries luxuries and enjoyments which form
    wealth  the laws which determine the distribution of wealth among the different
    classes into which society is divided and how it may be most profitably consumed
    to enter into lengthened arguments to prove the importance of a science having
    such objects in view would be worse than useless ihe consumption of wealth is
    indispensable to existence but the eternal law of providence has decreed that
    it can only be procured through the intervention of industry that man must earn
    his bread  in the sweat of his face this twofold necessity renders the production
    of wealth a constant and principal object of the exertions of the vast majority
    of the human race it has subdued the aversion of man from labour given activity
    to indolence and armed the patient hand of industry with zeal to undertake and
    perseverance to overcome the most difficult and disagreeable tasks when pursued
    with proper diligence these efforts seldom fail to attain the end in view and
    while they furnish the bulk of society with ample supplies of the articles required
    for their comfortable subsistence they afford time for the cultivation of those
    speculative inquiries and elegant tastes which elevate and adorn civilized man
    to use the words of dr barrow wealth is that which generally men of all things
    are wont to affect and covet with most ardent desire as the great storehouse of
    their needs and conveniences the sure bulwark of their state and dignity the universal
    instrument of compassing their designs and pleasures and most evident it is that
    in the natural course of things industry is the way to acquire it to secure it
    to improve and enlarge it the which course pursued innocently and modestly god
    will be so far from obstructing that he will further and bless it for that indeed
    it would be a flaw in providence if honest industry using the means it affordeth
    should fail of procuring a competency  but when the acquisition of wealth makes
    a part of the order of providence and is indispensable not merely to the supply
    of our necessary wants but to our progress in intelligence and refinement can
    we doubt the importance of the science which teaches the modes by which its acquisition
    may be facilitated and the greatest amount of wealth obtained with the least difficulty  there
    are none to whom a knowledge of political economy can be considered as extrinsic
    or superfluous there are some doubtless to whom it may be of more advantage than
    to others  but it is of paramount consequence to all the prosperity of individuals
    and nations does not depend nearly so much on salubrity of climate or fertility
    of soil as on their ability to apply labour with perseverance skill and judgment
    industry can balance almost every other deficiency it can render regions naturally
    inhospitable and unproductive the comfortable abodes of an intelligent and refined
    a crowded and wealthy population but where it is wanting the choicest gifts of
    nature are of no value  and countries possessed of the greatest capabilities of
    improvement with difficulty furnish a miserable subsistence to the see the first

    as of the highest importance but he did not consider that wealth consisted exclusively
    of gold or silver or that prohibitions and restrictions should be rashly imposed
    even on the intercourse with those countries with which the balance was supposed
    to be unfavourable but we are far from thinking that his commercial writings deserve
    the eulogies that have been bestowed on them or that they had any material effect
    in accelerating the progress of sound commercial science they do not contain a
    single principle not to be found in the work of sir josiah child some of davenants
    paragraphs are exceedingly good but the treatises of which they form a part are
    remarkably inconclusive and are for the most part pervaded by narrow and contracted
    views there is no evidence to show that he was at all aware of the influence of
    commerce in facilitating the production of wealth by giving rise to the territorial
    division of labour and enabling each people to devote itself in preference to
    those employments for the successful prosecution of which they have some peculiar
    advantage  jacob vanin  jacob vanderlint who describes himself as a derlint tradesman
    published his tract entitled money anstvers all things dugald stewart has referred
    to it in the appendix to his life of adam smith and has quoted some passages illustrative
    of the advantages of commercial freedom which he says  will bear a comparison
    both in point of good sense and liberality with what was so ably urged by mr hume
    twenty years afterwards in his essay on the jealousy of trade vanderlint closes
    his pamphlet with an argument in favour of the substitution of a territorial tax

    the french economists mr richin   mr richardson an extensive merchant pubardson

    frequently referred to by adam smith and it deserved his notice richardson is
    an intelligent and decided enemy of restrictions monopolies and prohibitions to
    give full freedom to industry he proposed that corporation privileges should be
    abolished and that the existing taxes should be repealed and replaced by a tax
    laid on the consumers of luxuries proportionally to their incomes the following
    extracts will give an idea of the spirit and ability which pervades this essay   in
    the memoirs of de witt it is said  that restraint is always hurtful to tradethe
    reason whereof is plain for nature has given various products to various countries
    and thereby knit mankind in an intercourse to supply each others wants to attempt
    to sell our products but to buy little or none from foreigners is attempting an
    impossibility acting contrary to the intent of nature cynically and absurdly and
    as ours is a populous manufacturing country might be prejudicial to our interests  for
    could we raise all necessaries and vanities within ourselves this intercourse
    designed by nature would be destroyed and then how is our navy our only bulwark
    to be maintained  p   trade cannot will not be forced let other nations prohibit
    by what severity they please interest will prevail they may embarrass their own
    trade but cannot hurt a nation whose trade is free so much as themselves spain
    has prohibited our woollens but had a reduction of our taxes brought them to their
    natural value only they would be the cheapest in europe of their goodness consequently
    history must be more demanded by the spaniards be smuggled v  into their country
    in spite of their government and sold at better prices their people would be dearer
    clothed with duties and prohibitions than without consequently must sell their
    oil wine and other commodities dearer whereby other nations raising the like growths
    would gain ground upon them and their balance of trade grow less and less but
    should we for that reason prohibit their commodities  by no means for the dearer
    they grow no more than what are just necessary will be used  their prohibition
    does their own business  some may be necessary for us  what are so we should not
    make dearer to our own people some may be proper to assort cargoes for other countries
    and why should we prohibit our people that advantage why hurt ourselves to hurt
    the spaniards  if we would retaliate effectually upon them for their ill intent
    handsome premiums given to our plantations to raise the same growths as spain
    might enable them to supply us cheaper than the spaniards could do and establish
    a trade they could never recover premiums may gain trade but prohibitions will
    destroy it p  mr richardson applies the same argument to expose the injurious
    influence of the restraints on the trade with france  i allow he says  that britain
    should be always vigilant over the designs of france but need not be afraid of
    her power her wise regulations in trade should be the objects we should keep our
    eyes upon and outdo her if possible or else as she rises we must sink but it is
    our comfort that our remedy is always in our own hands  nor can there be any solid
    reason for the nations paying dearer to other countries for goods we could buy
    cheaper in france would anywise dealer in london buy goods of a dutch shopkeeper
    for d or d when he could have the same from a french shopkeeper for is would he
    not consider that by so doing he would empty his own pockets the sooner and that
    in the end he would greatly injure his own family by such whims and shall this
    nation commit an absurdity that stares every private man in the face      the
    certain way to be secure is to be more powerfulthat is to extend our trade as
    far as it is capable of and as restraints have proved its ruin to reject them
    and depend on freedom for our security bidding defiance to the french or any nation
    in europe that took umbrage at our exerting our natural advantages p  we do not
    know that the impolicy of restrictions on the importation of foreign corn has
    ever been more triumphantly exposed than in the following passage every home commodity
    in a free trade will find its natural value  for though that fluctuates as of
    necessity it must according to the plentifulness or scarcity of seasons yet for
    the home consumption every home commodity must have great advantage over the foreign
    as being upon the spot and free from freight insurance commission and charges
    which on the produce of lands being all bulky commodities must in general be about  per
    cent and a greater advantage cannot be given without prejudice for  per cent makes
    a great difference in the price of necessaries between the nation selling and
    the nation buying and is a great difficulty on the latter but arising from the
    natural course of things cannot be helped though it is a sufficient security to
    the landholder that foreigners can never import more necessaries than are absolutely
    required and i presume in such cases they have more charity than to starve the
    people the progress of enlarged and liberal opinions with regard to commerce seems
    to have been in no small degree counteracted by the publication of the british

    queen annes tory administration in  it consists of a series of papers published
    weekly and afterwards collected in three volumes public opinion being very much
    against the treaty the british merchant enjoyed a arge share of popularity its

    this grand object they scruple not  certare ingenio contendere nobilitate noetes

    continue stationary or to retrograde is not natural to society man from youth
    grows to manhood then decays and dies but such is not the destiny of nations the
    arts the scientific discoveries and the capital of one generation become the patrimony
    of that which succeeds them  and as the former are imperishable and will continue
    to give birth to new arts and new discoveries in all time to come while the natural
    tendency of the latter is to increase it follows that if not counteracted by the
    want of security or by other adventitious causes the principle of improvement
    would always operate and would secure the constant advancement of nations in wealth
    and population  credit it may be said perhaps that however true the previous statements
    are incomplete from no mention being made of credit which we are assured plays
    an important part in all industrial operations but this is an entire mistake credit
    is not capital nor even anything real it is merely the term employed to designate
    the lending or transfer of capital by one individual to another the lender is
    said to give and the borrower to get or receive credit no doubt we often hear
    of this that and the other undertaking being carried on by means of credit but
    by this is really meant that they are carried on by the agency of borrowed capital
    and speaking generally the giving of credit or the lending of capital may be said
    to be advantageous because in most instances the borrowers employ it to better
    purpose than the lenders when however it is otherwise and capital is conveyed
    as is sometimes the case from the industrious and frugal to the idle and improvident
    the credit that has been given is plainly injurious and in all cases its influence
    whether for good or for evil depends on the capital being employed more or less
    advantageously after its transfer than before sect iiidifferent employments of
    capital and industry manufactures and commerce shown to he equally advantageous
    as agriculturerate of profit a true test of individual and public advantage afferent  in
    the previous section we endeavoured to show that the ployincrease and diminution
    of capital is the pivot on which ipitaland nation  al p ros p erit y principally
    hinges that an increase of dustry ca p proportionally increases the means of supporting
    and employing labour and that any considerable diminution of its amount seldom
    fails to lessen the comforts and enjoyments and perhaps also the necessaries of
    the productive classes and to spread poverty throughout the land and we also endeavoured
    to show that the increase and diminution of the rate of profit is the great cause
    of the increase and diminution of capital but if such be the case it would seem
    necessarily to follow that those employments which yield the greatest profit or
    in which industry is most productive are the most advantageous adam smith however
    with malthus and others have objected to production this inference d hey allow
    that if two capitals yield equal of wealth profits the employments in which they
    are engaged are equally beneficial to their possessors  but they contend that
    if one of them be employed in agriculture it will be productive of greater public
    advantage we believe however notwithstanding the deference due to the authorities
    referred to that this opinion rests on no good foundation and that the average
    rate of profit is the test by which we should always judge which employment is
    most and which is least advantageous a capital may be employed in four different
    waysviz first in the acquisition of raw products or secondly in manufacturing
    and preparing these raw products for use and consumption  or thirdly in transporting
    the raw and manufactured products from one place to another according to the demand
    or fourthly in dividing either into such small parcels as may suit the public
    convenience and supplying them to those by whom they are wanted the capital of
    those who undertake the improvement or cultivation of lands mines or fisheries
    is employed in the first of these ways that of master manufacturers in the second
    that of wholesale merchants in the third and that of retailers in the fourth it
    is difficult to conceive that a capital should be employed in any way which may
    not be classed under one or other of these heads it is unnecessary to enlarge
    on the importance of ememployploying capital in the acquisition of raw produce
    and men tof especially in the cultivation of the soil it is from the ca p ital
    in latter including therein mines and fisheries that the matter agncul  of all
    commodities that minister to our necessities comforts ture  and enjoyments is
    originally derived the industry which appropriates the raw or spontaneous products
    of the earth preceded every other but these are always comparatively limited and
    it is by agriculture onlythat is by the united application of immediate labour
    and capital to the cultivationof the groundthat large supplies of those species
    of produce which form the principal part of the food of man can be obtained it
    is not quite certain whether any of the principal bread corns as wheat barley
    rye oats c have been discovered growing spontaneously but although this must originally
    have been the case their extreme scarcity and the labour required to raise them
    in considerable quantities prove that we are indebted for them almost exclusively
    to agriculture the transition from the pastoral to the agricultural mode of life
    is the most important step in the progress of society whenever indeed we compare
    the supplies of food and other raw products obtained from a given surface of a
    wellcultivated country with those obtained from the same extent of an equally
    fertile country occupied by hunters or shepherds the powers of agricultural industry
    in increasing useful productions appear so extraordinary that we cease to feel
    surprise at the preference which was so early and generally given to agriculture
    over manufactures and commerce and are disposed to subscribe without hesitation
    to the panegyric of cicero when he says  omnium autem rerum ex quibus aliquid
    acquiritur nihil est agricultura melius nihil uberius nihil dulcius nihil homine
    libero digniusi  but are there any really just grounds for this preference  are
    not manufactures and commerce as advantageous as agriculture  without the latter

    intion of fluence is not more for their own than for the public adwealth van tage
    part iii distribution of wealth having thus endeavoured to trace the various methods
    by which that labour which is the only source of wealth may be rendered most productive
    and to exhibit the relation and dependence of the different kinds of industry
    we proceed to the third division of our subject or to an investigation of the
    laws regulating the proportions in which the various products of art and industry
    are distributed among the different classes of the people sect primary division
    of the produce of industry  value of commodities measured in the earliest stages
    of society by the quantities of labour expended in their production rimary it
    is evident that only three classeslabourers capitalivision of i s ts and owners
    of landcan be directly concerned in the uoof p roduction of commodities it is
    to them therefore that idustry a that is derived from the surface of the earth
    or from its bowels by the united application of immediate labour and capital must
    primarily belong the other classes if such there be have no revenue except what
    they derive either voluntarily or by compulsion from these three classes but although
    there be no state of society in which any class besides labourers landlords and
    capitalists participates directly in the produce of industry there are states
    of society in which that produce belongs to one only of these classes and others
    in which it belongs to two of them to the exclusion of the third the reason is
    that in the earlier stages of society little or no capital being accumulated there
    is no distinction between labourers and capitalists  and that in all newlysettled
    and unappropriated countries abundance of fertile lands may be obtained without
    paying any rent uantity of in that remote period which preceded the establishment
    hour the  f property in land and the accumulation of capital or indole   wllen
    men roatne d without any settled habitations value  ver the surface of the earth
    and existed by the appropriation of its spontaneous productionsthe whole produce
    of labour belonged to the labourer and the quantity of it required to procure
    different articles formed the only standard by which their relative worth or exchangeable
    value could be estimated  if among a nation of hunters says adam smith  it usually
    costs twice the labour to kill a beaver that it does to kill a deer one beaver
    would naturally exchange for or be worth two deer it is natural that what is usually
    the produce of two days or two hours labour should be worth double of what is
    usually the produce of one days or one hours labour if the one species of labour
    should be more severe than the other some allowance will naturally be made for
    this superior hardship  and the produce of one hours labour in the one way frequently
    exchanges for that of two hours labour in the other  or if the one species of
    labour requires an uncommon degree of dexterity and ingenuity the esteem which
    men have for such talents will naturally give a value to their produce superior
    to what would be due to the time employed about it such talents can seldom be
    acquired but m consequence of long application  and the superior value dtheir
    produce may frequently be no more than a reasonable compensation for the time
    and labour which must be spent in acquiring them in the advanced state of distribusociety
    allowances of this kind for superior hardship and superior skill are commonly
    made in the wages of labour wealth and something of the same kind must probably
    have taken place in the earliest and rudest period  in this state of things the
    whole produce of labour belongs to the labourer and the quantity of labour commonly
    employed in acquiring or producing any commodity is the only circumstance which
    can regulate the quantity of labour of other commodities which it commonly ought
    to purchase command or exchange for wealth of nations p  thus far there is no
    room for doubt or difference of opinion where there are none but labourers they
    only can share in its produce and the quantity of labour required to produce articles
    or procure services forms the only standard by which their value is estimated
    it is at this point therefore that the investigation of the laws which regulate
    the division of the produce of industry among the three great classes of labourers
    capitalists and landlords should properly begin  and we shall commence it by endeavouring
    in the first place to acquire a knowledge of the laws which determine the value
    of commodities in an advanced period of society when circulating and fixed capital
    are employed in their production and when land is appropriated and rent paid a
    previous acquaintance with these laws is necessary to ascertain the principles
    which regulate their distribution sect preliminary considerationsequality of wages
    and profitsinquiry into the effect of variations of demand and supply on value
    and price cost of production shown to be their regulating principle if the popular
    opinions on this subject were well founded prelimithe inquiry on which we are
    about to enter might be disnai  con posed of in a few words ihe value of commodities
    when sera don compared with each other and their value or price when compared
    with money is held almost universally to depend on their abundance or scarcity
    in the market compared with the demand but though this statement has some it has
    but a very small admixture of truth and it will be found that the prices of commodities
    are determined speaking generally by the cost of their productionthat is by the
    quantities of labour required to produce them and bring them to market before
    however we proceed further it may be proper the better to facilitate our investigations
    in this and the following sections to premise that wherever industry is free the
    rate of wages earned by the labourers in specified departments and the rate of
    profit derived from the capital vested in them cannot for any considerable period
    taking everything into account either fall below or rise above the rates of wages
    and profits accruing to the labourers and capitalists engaged in other departments
    with regard to the first of these positions or the equality equality of of the
    wages earned by those engaged in different employthe wages ments it is not meant
    to infer that all labourers receive earned b y precisely the same sum of money
    or the same proportion  e labour  of the produce of their labour such an opinion
    would be indifferent equally at variance with fact and with principle wages branches
    of are a compensation made to the labourer for the exertion industry of his physical
    powers or of his skill or ingenuity they therefore vary according to the greater
    intensity of the labour to be performed and to the degree of skill and ingenuity
    required wages would not be equal if a jeweller or engraver for example received
    no more than a common farmservant or scavenger a long course of trainiim is required
    to instruct a man in the businesses of jewellery and engraving and if this were
    not compensated by a higher rate of wages none would choose to learn such

    themselves in tion of preference to such employments as hardly require any training
    the cost of producing artificers or labourers regulates the wages they obtain
    in the same way that the cost of producing commodities regulates their value artizans
    who practise a difficult or nice business lose all the time spent in their apprenticeship
    as well as the clothes and provisions consumed during its currency hence in addition
    to the rate paid to farmservants and those who get little or no training their
    wages should include a payment for the extra time and expense required to learn
    their business if they be either more or less than are sufficient to compensate
    for this greater outlay on their education workpeople will in the former case
    be attracted to their peculiar departments and in the latter they will leave them
    to go to others  this influx on the one hand and efflux on the other being sure
    to continue till wages have found their just and true level besides this prominent
    cause of apparent inequality wages vary in amount proportionally to the ease and
    hardship the agreeableness and disagreeableness the constancy and inconstancy
    of employment in the greater number ot manufactures a journeyman may except in
    periods of general distress usually obtain constant employment but there are several
    businesses such as those of masons and bricklayers that can neither be carried
    on in hard frost nor foul weather their earnings should therefore be sufficient
    not only to maintain them while they are employed but also while they are idle
    and to make them some compensation for those anxious and desponding moments which
    the thought of so precarious a situation must sometimes occasion hence says smith  where
    the computed earnings of the greater part of manufacturers are nearly upon a level
    with the daywages of common labourers those of masons and bricklayers are generally
    from a half more to double those wages where common labourers earn four and five
    shillings a week masons and bricklayers frequently earn seven and eight and where
    the former earn nine or ten as in london the latter commonly earn fifteen and
    eighteen wealth of nations p  but these variations instead of being inconsistent
    with the principle we have been endeavouring to establish plainly result from
    it wages are not equal when each workman earns the same number of shillings or
    of pence in a given space of time but when each is paid in proportion to the severity
    of the labour he has to perform the degree of pievious education and of skill
    that it requires and the other causes of variation so long indeed as competition
    is allowed to operate without let or hindrance of any kind or as every one may
    employ himself as he pleases the higgling of the market will always adjust the
    rate of wages on the principle now mentioned and it will in reality be neaily
    equal in different employments if it were depressed in one department below the
    common level labourers would leave it to go to others and if it were raised above
    it labourers would be attracted from the departments where wages were lower until
    the increased supply had sunk hem to their just level a period of greater or less
    duration according to the circumstances of the country at the time is always required
    to bring about this equalization but all theoretical inquiries and such as have
    the establishment of principles for their object either are or should be founded
    on periods of average duration  and when such is the case we may always without
    occasioning any error of consequence assume that the wages earned in different
    employments are all things considered about equal in like manner the profit accruing
    to the undertakers of different businesses varies proportionally to the greater
    or less risk and other circumstances affecting the capital which is employed in
    them it is obvious indeed that distribution of wealth equality of the profits
    of the capital employ ed in different busiprofits have not attained their proper
    level until they have been adjusted so as to balance these advantages and disadvantages
    none would engage in unusually hazardous undertakings did the capital which they
    employ only yield the same profit that might be obtained by employing it in more
    secure businesses none will voluntarily place their fortunes in situations of
    comparative danger extraordinary risk must be compensated and hence the wellknown
    distinction between gross and nett profit gross profit varies according to the
    risk respectability and agieeableness of different employments whereas nett profit
    is the same or nearly the same in them all a gunpowder manufacturer for example
    must obtain as much profit over and above that which is obtained from the securest
    businesses as will suffice to guarantee or insure his capital from the extraordinary
    risk to which it is exposed in a business of such extreme hazard were he to obtain
    more than this amount additional capital would be attracted to the business and
    were he to obtain less capital would be withdrawn from it the everacting principle
    of competition or which is the same thing the selfinterest of every individual
    will not permit the wages or profits of any particular set of workmen or capitalists
    taking all things into account to continue either long below or long above the
    common and average rate of wages and profits obtained by those who are employed
    or have capital vested in other businesses it is by this common standard that
    the wages and profits of particular businesses are always regulated they never
    diverge considerably from it they have a constant tendency to equalization  and
    may in theoretical inquiries be supposed without occasioning any erroi of consequence
    exactly to coincide the equality or rather the constant tendency to equality of
    the wages earned by the labourers and of the profits derived from the capital
    employed at the same time in the various branches of industry was pointed out
    by harris and also by cantillon in his work entitled the analysis of trade c published
    in  but it was first fully demonstrated in the eighth ninth and tenth chapters
    of the first book of the wealth of nations i he establishment of this principle
    was one of the greatest services rendered by adam smith to the science nothing
    can be more convincing and satisfactory than his reasoning on this subject the
    equality of wages and of profits has since the publication of his work been always
    assumed as admitted and incontestible the equality of wages and profits once established
    it is variations easy to see that variations in the demand and supply of of demand
    commodities can exert no lasting influence over price nsupp v the cost of production
    denominated by smith and the p emarient marquis garnier necessary or natural price
    is the ultimate in fl uenc e regulator of the value of every commodity not subject
    to a on price monopoly of which the quantity may be indefinitely increased by
    the application of fresh capital and labour to its production the market price
    of such commodities and their cost do not always coincide  but they cannot for
    any considerable period be far separated and have a constant tendency to equality
    commodities will not continue to be produced if they sell for less than the cost
    of their production  that is for less than will repay the outlay upon them including
    the ordinary rate of profit on the capital employed this is a limit below which
    it is plain prices cannot be permanently reduced and it is equally plain that
    were they for any considerable period to rise above it additional capital would
    be attracted to the advantageous business and the competition of the producers
    would lower pi ices a demand to be effectual must be such as will cover the expense
    of production if it be insufficient to do t is it is insufficient to make commodities

  text: political economy distribuj ie produce of anterior labour that its accumulation
    and employment is consistent with or rather is embodied in the proposition that
    the value of commodities depends on the labour required for their production a
    commodity may be altogether produced by capital without the cooperation of any
    immediate labour and it so its value will be determined by the quantity of capital
    that is of antecedent labour expended on its production or it may be partly produced
    by capital and partly by immediate labour and then its value will be proportioned
    to the sum of the two or which is the same thing to the total amount of labour
    bestowed upon it the principles now laid down are almost selfevident and have
    been generally assented to but a considerable difference of opinion is entertained
    respecting the influence which the employment of workmen by capitalists and the
    fluctuations in their wages have over value it does not however seem that there
    is much room for ployment these differences suppose that a certain quantity of
    goods of workga y twenty pairs of stockings manufactured by independent ttalisi   workmen
    freely exchange for forty pairs of gloves also does not manufactured by independent
    workmen  they would conraise the tinue to be exchanged on this footing provided
    the quanprice of tity of labour required for their production continued uncommodichanged
    though the workmen should be employed by ties  master manufacturers in the first
    case it is true as adam smith has observed that the goods produced by the workmen
    belong wholly to themselves and that in the second case they have to share them
    with others but it must be recollected that in the first case the capital made
    use of in their production also belonged to the workmen and that in the latter
    case it has been supplied to them by others the question then comes to bedoes
    the circumstance of labourers voluntarily agreeing to give a portion of the commodities
    produced by them as an equivalent or compensation for the use of capital supplied
    to them by others afford any ground for raising the price of such commodities  it
    is evident it does not the profits of stock are only another name for the wages
    of accumulated labour they enter into the price of every commodity in the production
    of which any portion of capital has been expended but whether the capital belong
    to the labourer or is furnished to him by another is obviously of no consequence
    w hen the capital does not belong to the labourer the commodities he produces
    are divided into txoo portions whereof one is the return for the immediate labour
    and the other for the capital or accumulated labour required for their production
    but the value of the produce is the same into how many portions soever it may
    be divided a shoemaker who manufactures shoes on his own account obtains the same
    profits on their sale that would accrue to the mastershoemaker who should employ
    him as a workman he must have capital to maintain himself and his family until
    his shoes are disposed of to provide himself with a workshop and tools to advance
    money to the tanner to pay his leather and to meet other outgoings if he did not
    exclusive of the ordinary wages of labour realise a profit or a return for his
    capital equal to the profit obtained by the mastershoemaker it would be for his
    advantage to lend his capital to the latter and to work on his account and it
    is plain inasmuch as his shoes would not sell for a higher price than those of
    the capitalist that he could not realise a greater profit it is immaterial therefore
    whether the accumulated labour or capital and the immediate labour employed in
    the production of commodities be furnished by the same or by different parties
    it is by the total quantity of labour necessarily expended upon them and not by
    the channels through which it is supplied that their value is determined it now
    only remains to trace the influence of fluctuations the eniof wages on price when
    this is done the subject will be distribuexhausted ton of to simplify this inquiry
    we shall divide it into two wealth branches we shall inquire first whether fluctuations
    of wages have any and if any what effects on the value of effect of commodities
    produced by the aid of capitals of equal degrees aquations j of durability  and
    second whether these fluctuations have e rate any and if any what effects when
    the capitals employed exchange are of unequal degrees of durability able i when
    all classes of producers employ fixed or circuvalue lating capitals of the same
    degree of durability they must  effect of i i be all equally affected by a rise
    or fall of wages this j principle is admitted by every one and is indeed selfeviw
    heuhe dent but when such is the case it is plainly impossible capitals that a
    rise or fall of wages should occasion any variation in employed the value of commodities
    to revert to our former exin producample  let it be supposed that wages at the
    rate of a shilling are of a day were paid by the stocking manufacturer a pair
    of whose stockings exchanged for two pairs of gloves and durability that from
    some cause or other the wages of his workpeople have been doubled or raised to
    two shillings the question is will he now obtain a greater quantity of gloves
    for his stockings  it is obvious he will not he cannot urge the fact of his having
    to pay higher wages as a reason why the glove manufacturer should give him more
    gloves in exchange for stockings for the latter would have it in his power to
    reply that the same rise of wages affected him to precisely the same extent if
    therefore one pair of stockings were previously worth two pairs of gloves they
    would continue to preserve that relation so long as the quantities of labour required
    for their production did not vary whatever might be the fluctuation of wageswhether
    they fell to a sixpence or rose to five shillings a day even if the price of commodities
    rose which it does not when wages rise that would be no advantage to the producers
    commodities are always bought by commodities or by labour of what consequence
    then would it be to a capitalist to sell when wages rose his commodities at an
    equal advance seeing that he in his turn would be obliged to give so much more
    for every article which he has to purchase  were wages to rise ten per cent a
    producera hatter for examplewould be in precisely the same condition whether he
    sold his hats for ten per cent advance and gave an additional ten per cent as
    he would be obliged to do for his food shoes clothes c c or sold his hats at their
    former price and bought the articles for which he has occasion at the prices he
    formerly paid for them in order farther to illustrate this principle we may be
    allowed to make a supposition which though it cannot actually take place will
    serve to set this doctrine in a clearer point of view should the quantities of
    labour required for the production of all sorts of commodities be increased in
    exactly the same proportion their exchangeable values would plainly remain unaltered
    their cost would however be augmented a bushel of corn would not then exchange
    for a greater quantity of muslins or of broad cloth than it did before the increased
    expense of its production  but each would be the produce of more than the former
    quantity of labour under such circumstances the prices of commodities would remain
    stationary while the wealth and comforts of the society would be materially diminished
    every person would have to make greater exertions to obtain a given supply of
    any one commodity  but as the expense of producing all commodities is by the supposition
    equally increased it would not be necessary to make any greater exertions to obtain
    one than another and their values as compared with each other would be totally
    unaffected in these statements it is taken for granted that the value of money
    has been invariable but if it become either more or loss valuable then undoubtedly

  text: political economy  consumption of wealth peasantry of ireland when they lived
    only on potatoes and buttermilk had much more of the character ot productive labourers
    than those of britain  i he mere statement of such a doctrine is sufficient for
    its refutation everything that stimulates exertion is advantageous  he mere necessaries
    of life may be obtained with comparatively little labour and those savage and
    uncivilized hordes who have no desire to possess its comforts are proverbially
    indolent and dissipated to make men industriousto make them shake off what seems
    to be their natural lethargy  they must be inspired with a taste for the luxuries
    and enjoyments of civilized life when this is done their artificial wants become
    equally clamorous with those that are strictly necessary and they increase exactly
    as the means of gratifying them increase wherever a taste for comforts and conveniences
    is generally diffused the wants and desires of man become altogether illimitable
    the gratification of one leads directly to the formation of another in civilized
    societies new products and new modes of enjoyment are constantly presenting themselves
    as motives to exertion and as means for its reward the operations of industry
    are prosecuted without intermission and idleness with its attendant train of evils
    almost entirely disappear  what asks paley  can be less necessary or less connected
    with the sustentation of human life than the whole produce of the silk lace and
    plate manufactory yet what multitudes labour in the different branches of these
    arts what can be imagined more capricious than the fondness for tobacco and snuff
    yet how many various occupations and how many thousands in each are set at work
    in administering to this frivolous gratification  the stimulus given to industry
    by the desire to possess these articles renders their introduction advantageous
    the earth is capable of furnishing food adequate for the support of a much greater
    number of human beings than can be profitably employed in its cultivation but
    its owners will not part with their produce for nothing or rather they will not
    raise what they can neither use themselves nor employ to buy what they want as
    soon however as a taste for conveniences and luxuries is introduced this difficulty
    is got over the occupiers of the ground forthwith endeavour to raise from it the
    most that it can be made to produce that they may exchange the surplus for the
    articles offered to them by manufacturers and merchants and hence though the latter
    have neither property in the soil nor any concern in its cultivation they are
    regularly and liberally supplied with its produce in this way the quantity of
    necessaries as well as of useful and agreeable products is vastly increased by
    the introduction of a taste for luxuries and while the people are infinitely better
    provided for their numbers are greatly augmented so long therefore as the consumption
    of luxuries is confined within proper limits it is quite unexceptionable but when
    it exceeds these limits that is when it is greater than the consumers can afford
    it becomes injurious the injury however would be quite as great if they consumed
    an equivalent amount of necessaries the mischief consists in the cost or value
    of the articles consumed exceeding the means of the consumers and not in their
    belonging to this or that description or species of articles bu except in cases
    where credit has been obtained through fraudulent representations this is a fault
    which may be safely left to be dealt with by those concerned the poverty and degradation
    that are sure to result from reckless consumption is a sufficient guarantee against
    its being carried to an injurious extent to attempt to lessen it by proscribing
    luxury is like attempting to enrich a country by taking away some of the most
    powerful motives to production adam smith has given another criterion of productive
    vol xviii and unproductive consumption but though exceedingly consampingenious
    and supported with his usual ability his opinions tion of on this point appear
    to rest on no solid foundation he e alth divides society into two great classes
    the first consists of those who fix or as he terms it  realize their labour smiths
    in some particular subject or vendible commodity which criterion f lasts for some
    time at least after that labour is past the second of those whose labour leaves
    nothing in existence duetive     after the moment of exertion but perishes in
    the act ofconsumpperformance the former are said by smith to be protioaductive
    the latter miproductive labourers not that in making this distinction he meant
    to undervalue the services rendered by the latter or to deny that they are frequently
    indispensable but he contends that how advantageous soever these services not
    having any results of a fixed and transferable character add nothing to the wealth
    of a country and that consequently the labour of those by whom they have been
    rendered has been unproductively expended to avoid however all chance of misrepresentation
    we shall give smiths opinions in his own words  there is one sort of labour says
    he  which adds to the value of the subject upon which it is bestowed there is
    another which has no such effect the former as it produces a value may be called
    productive the latter unproductive labour thus the labour of a manufacturer adds
    generally to the value of the materials which he works upon that of his own maintenance
    and of his masters profit the labour of a menial servant on the contrary adds
    to the value of nothing though the manufacturer has his wages advanced to him
    by his master he in reality costs him no expense the value of those wages being
    generally restored together with a profit in the improved value of the subject
    upon which his labour is bestowed but the maintenance of a menial servant never
    is restored a man grows rich by employing a multitude of manufacturers he grows
    poor by maintaining a multitude of menial servants the labour of the latter however
    has its value and deserves its reward as well as that of the former but the labour
    of the manufacturers fixes and realizes itself in some particular subject or vendible
    commodity which lasts for some time at least after that labour is past it is as
    it were a certain quantity of labour stocked and stored up to be employed if necessary
    upon some other occasion that subject or what is the same thing the price of that
    subject can afterwards if necessary put into motion a quantity of labour equal
    to that which had originally produced it the labour ot the menial servant on the
    contrary does not fix or realize itself in any particular subject or vendible
    commodity his services generally perish in the very instant of their performance
    and seldom leave any trace or value behind them for which an equal quantity of
    service could afterwards be procured  the labour of some of the most respectable
    orders in the society is like that of menial servants unproductive ot any value
    and does not fix or realize itself in any permanent subject or vendible commodity
    which endures after that labour is past and for which an equal quantity of labour
    could afterwards be procured t he sovereign for example with all the officers
    both of justice and war who serve under him the whole army and navy are unproductive
    labourers they are the servants ot the public and are maintained by a part of
    the annual produce of the industry of other people their service how honourable
    how necessary or how useful soever pioduces nothing for which an equal quantity
    of service can afterwards be procured this protection security and defence of
    the commonwealth the effect of their labour this year will not purchase its protection

    the sums required for use in the arts  and r d to supply those that are hoarded
    anti carried away in the pockets of emigrants c c the last item now referred to
    is of much more importance than is generally supposed taking the entire number
    of emigrants from europe to the united states australia and all other places at  a
    year it is pretty certain that they do not take with them at an average less than
    from l to l in coin besides plate watches rings c some estimates make the exports
    of bullion by emigrants much greater than this but even on this very moderate
    hypothesis it will amount to l a year in coin only hence as compared with the
    outgoings the supply of bullion in europe during the last seven or eight years
    far from being in excess lias been scanty rather than otherwise and without a
    diminution of the former or an increase of the latter most people amongst us will
    be but little sensible of the influence of calilbrnian and australian gold the
    previous statements seem to be sufficient to show that the present supply of the
    precious metals is not more than adequate to meet the existing demand and thattherefore
    there is no ground for anticipating a fall in their value unless the supply should
    be increased or the demand diminished it is now ten years since the increased
    supplies of gold from california and seven since those from australia have been
    poured into the markets of europe and america and yet there has not during that
    period been anything like a general rise of prices on the contrary the prices
    of most articles are as low at this moment december  as they were at the same
    time in  while several are a good deal lower and of the few that have risen in
    price since the latter epoch there is not one of which the rise may not be satisfactorily
    explained by something peculiar to itself and affecting either its demand or the
    conditions of its supply or both thus the rise that has taken place in the rate
    of wages in great britain and in ireland is wholly ascribable partly to the greater
    demand for labour partly to the extent to which emigration has been carried and
    partly to the potato rot and the consequent famine in ireland there is in truth
    nothing whatever in comparing the prices of today with those of ten years ago
    to entitle any one to affirm that the value of gold and silver has undergone the
    smallest change in the interval it has been attempted to show that gold has fallen
    in value by alleging that the value of silver as compared with it has increased
    but a rise may take place in the comparative value of silver without its being
    occasioned by a corresponding fall in the value of gold the value of silver is
    affected by a variety of circumstances peculiar to itself and if it have really
    increased during the last half dozen years such increase may be satisfactorily
    accounted for by the extraordinarily increased demand for it in the east it is
    however very doubtful whether there has been any rise hi the value of silver as
    compared with gold yve subjoin an account of the price of silver per oz in london

    the precious metals it does not appear from this table that the price of silver
    has risen during these seven years it appears to have fluctuated much less than
    might have been anticipated its extremes being  and  making its value as compared
    with that of standard gold at e s d an oz  as  to  and  to   but at an average
    of the entire period there has been no sensible variation ihat there is but little
    probability that prices will be raised by a continuance of the present supplies
    of gold and silver may be inferred from what took place after the discovery of
    america in  it appears from the researches of adam smith  and other authorities
    that the influx of the piecious metals had exerted its full effect upon prices
    previously to or about  and yet this influx was much greater then and subsequently
    than it had been at any previous period according to the best information attainable
    the average annual importation of the precious metals from america into europe
    from  down to  may be estimated as follows  from  to  l a year                                    annual
    average of the entire period  l in  or  when the bullion of america had produced
    its full effect on prices in europe its annual influx amounted to about l and
    yet though its influx was nearly trebled between that epoch and  it is admitted
    on all hands that down to the lastmentioned year there was no general rise of
    prices  the increased demand of europe was fully sufficient to take off this great
    increase of supply without any fall taking place in the value of silver indeed
    it is contended by some high authorities that instead of falling it rose in value
    during the period referred to there can be no manner of doubt not merely that
    the quantity of the precious metals employed in europe and america is incomparably
    greater now than in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries but that the demand
    for additional quantities is also incomparably greater and when it is seen that
    their value continued stationary from  to  despite the immense additional supplies
    that were thrown upon the market there is it is plain little ground for wonder
    that their late increase great as it has been has not affected their values or
    for anticipating that they will materially decline in the course of the next half
    century should it however turn out that we are mistaken in these conclusions and
    that a considerable fall in the value of the precious metals is about to commence
    it is satistactory to know that there are no really tenable a very considerable
    addition has been made to the metallic currency of the united kingdom during the
    last ten years owin ioever to our gold coins being exempted from seignorage they
    have no greater value than an equal weight of standard bullion and are exported
    indifferently with the latter hence the accounts of the sums coined throw if taken

  text: l a law prevent differences by ruling relationships by conti act would be
    greater tbe more they tended to give bii tli to differences it is on this principle
    that the order of the evolution of law is to be explained in transactions between
    equals entered into oy contract appeared a farther approach to law what they agreed
    upon was the rule of their relationship what was once satisfactorily the rule
    of a relationship was repeated if frequently repeated it became a custom or usage
    transactions not provided for by contract fell to be decided ex post facto to
    these a rule previously acted upon if there was such would probably be applied
    where there was no clear rule that could be held to be implied or that could be
    agreed upon ex post facto recourse was had to other means of settling the matter
    in dispute as to a reference to an impartial person whose decision again influenced
    future cases and the terms of future contracts it is thus the terms of decisions
    and of contracts grow into customs it is worth while considering how far equity
    enters into rules of law derived from contracts whose terms are privately arranged
    where the contractors put themselves into the position of an impartial person
    and settle terms from his standpoint equity directly enters into the terms the
    only case for consideration is where their conceptions of right being modelled
    on their desires are made to differ from those commonly entertained and the rule
    is reached by a process of double position here either the rule of the contract
    is what bystanders approve of or it is not only in the former case will it be
    adopted and passed into custom contracts from this source then must involve equity
    to pass into law that they should often do so appears from the consideration that
    in advancing to a rule the contractors are forced to recognise equality of advantage
    as the ideal rule of the contract customs   y e i iave seen i w rules of relationships
    formed in the intercourse of equals pass by arbitration and contract into customs
    in early times only equals would submit their differences to the decision of neutral
    persons or consent to rule their relationships by contract because only equals
    had a common interest in obtaining the settlement of their differences by these
    means equity then entered into all decisions and contracts in early times and
    thence into the rules of custom derived from them and into law so far as it is
    an organic growth from the constitution and circumstances of a people a distinction
    already hinted at must here be brought out between customs due to the intercourse
    of equals and those due to the intercourse of superiors and inferiors it was said
    that from the latter arose no principles for imitation by equals in forming relationships
    between themselves it may now be said that the latter class of customs are permissive
    and not regulating and are only for consideration here as illustrating the condition
    of things from which law gradually rescues men all the customs that shock ones
    sense of justice and humanitythe exposition of infantsthe powers of a roman father
    over his childrenare remnants of the condition anterior to law and respect acts
    and relationships not rescued from that condition because they lay without the
    sphere of operation of the causes by which law has everywhere been developed ihey
    are proofs of the slowness of men to extend by sympathy to others benefits which
    by force they assert for themselves  hat sympathy is among the causes which develop
    law is certain  but it is only by concurrence with a highly stimulated selfishness
    that it recovers the relations of superiors and inferiors from arbitrary rule
    it is owing to this that law has been almost everywhere developed in some degree
    differently with respect to different classes of the same people when it was first
    asserted in cities that law ought to be equal for all the claim was advanced only
    for the classes of freemen who were themselves the parties making it at first
    w ireplolkoi peregrini immigrants helots and slaves of every law kind were disallowed
    equal privileges women everywhere to this day are without equal rights one class
    of our own people reserve the right of being tried by their peers but it is in
    the intercourse of nations who form as yet a rude society that the truth of the
    proposition is most noticeable war is the moderator of the consciences of states
    where success is easy the sense of justice rarely impedes their aggressive tendencies
    where it is difficult their morality shuts them up to noninterference in europe
    where the states are interested in maintaining the balance of power an approach
    to equity is made in the regulation of the relations of states great and small
    but outside europein india china japan africathe european states practise the
    morality of superiors and gratify every desire however iniquitous in satisfying
    which they are not led into conflict with one another so that the area over which
    an approach to law has been made in the intercourse of nations is conterminous
    with that over which the sense of a common interest extends and identifies the
    security of individual states with that of all with the widening of that area
    and the increasing intensity of that sense international law will spread and grow
    nowhere is law local or international other than that sense by its direct or indirect
    operation constitutes it how sympathy of itself fails to effect the recovery of
    the relations of superiors and inferiors from arbitrariness falls not to be explained
    here whoever appreciates what adam smith moral sentiments part i sect  has written
    of the dependence of sympathy on imagination will have no difficulty in understanding
    the failure it is in virtue of public opinion originating in the experience of
    what is conducive to the common good and mostly supported by the authority of
    religion that before government is fairly established and exercises its judicial
    and executive functions customs acquire for the rules which they embody some degree
    of the force and generality of law one of the first institutions of government
    is an agency to give effect to the rules of customfunctionaries appointed by the
    sovereign to act as judges taking the place of selfconstituted umpires and arbiters
    custom customthe when its rules are thus administered and enforced by the sovereign
    is the highest rudimentary form of jaw  it is fnot ary surprising says mr james
    mill  to what an extent oveij avv  the surface of the whole globe law has in all
    ages remained in that state of imperfect existence if indeed with any propriety
    it can be called a state of existence in every part of asia in all ages law has
    remained in that state of existence or nonexistence in europe where at a pretty
    early period it became the practice to record in writing the proceedings of the
    judges the natural propensity of referring to the past as a rule for the present
    begat in time a species of obligation of being directed by the examples which
    had already been set this created a uniformity and certainty which however imperfect
    afforded something better than the arbitrary proceedings of asiatic judges yet
    this was a benefit which had a dreadful alloy a body not of law but of decisions
    out of which on each particular occasion a law for that particular occasion as
    out of the crude ore was to be smelted hammered and wiredrawn was the natural
    material out of which to manufacture a system of chicane a system of laws so constructed
    becomes an instrument of conservation of the barbarous customs and ideas of the
    times in which they were engendered and infests society with the evils of an age
    which it has left behind of this effect of custom there will be occasion to write
    hereafter by a change of view however it is possible to admire instead of deploring
    that provision of nature by which custom is made to preserve the popular experience
    and thus to accumulate the materials which the legislator must employ in attempting

  text: l a w  law tho sovereign power opinion acting cri tically on existing laws
    law and morality to perfect the laws of his country even under the legisj lators
    superintendence law is apt to grow up somewhat rankly and it is well that its
    growth is so far independent of his care  as civilization advances and government
    becomes firmly established the sovereigns judicial function is exchanged for the
    legislative he enacts new laws sometimes arbitrarily sometimes on a principle
    and amends and repeals old rules or rears up a homogeneous and systematic body
    of law out of the mass of popular usages thereafter this body receives successive
    differentiations and accretions as popular habits change with new occupations
    when the sovereign perceives that his interests and those of the people are identical
    and that the subordination of individual interests to those of the community is
    the principle on which legislation ought to proceed he makes laws in greater consistency
    with one another seeks to anticipate cases and to make law popular and effective
    by giving it publicity and certainty the consideration however of the bearings
    of sovereignty on the growth of law must be postponed until the action of opinion
    on law has been farther considered  while in the growth of law custom drew in
    and hugged the accidents of the soil round the rules of equity opinion based on
    these but expanding with improving conceptions tended to loosen and remove them
    it was at first wavering and divided  then men of speculative minds orators poets
    philosophers and ministers of religion gave it precision and definite direction
    by their sentiments and doctrines they refined the rude juridical notions of early
    times and gave rise to the maxims which by approving themselves to popular experience
    established the despotism of opinion which met many necessities for which neither
    laws nor the actual power of each individual could provide whoever violated the
    rules approved of by the people had to dread their resentment weakness became
    formidable to power by being armed with the sympathies of mankind the manner in
    which opinion grew up with law beginning to grow with its first germs but rapidly
    shooting in advance of them and thereafter always maintaining itself in the advance
    may be traced in the history of morality  and as the action of morality on law
    is among the chief of the influences determining its development it is particularly
    important that their relation should be understood the rationale of the action
    of opinion on law is of itself simple enough experience at once generated rules
    of action and doctrines respecting conduct and while use and wont and convenience
    preserved the rules reflection and riper experience changed the doctrines the
    new doctrines on being propagated produced popular dispositions or fell in with
    them by which they were in turn passed into rules of law realized and fixed in
    the rear of advancing opinion the conceptions of right and wrong struck out in
    the intercourse of equals were the foundations of opinions respecting conduct
    as the highest and lowest in society had their coequals all partook of instruction
    in the same principlesin the same schoolif in different forms we have seen that
    these conceptions rested on associations of legal qualities with facts induced
    by experience of the imprudence and inconvenience of preventing these facts operating
    to vest enjoyments in particular persons the conceptions of enjoyments as properly
    vested in particular persons are conceptions of rights and the same experience
    gave birth to these and to prudential motives to respect rights it thus at once
    gave birth to morality and law as these prudential motives and the rules for the
    regulation of the desires based on them which afterwards passed into moral rules
    existed from the first only relatively to the realities however rude of law morality
    was at the first dependent on if not coincident with law the argument from another
    law point of view of dr whewell elements of morality vol i pp   on the dependence
    of morality on law when carried back to the limit establishes the same position
    its truth however rests not wholly on an abstract argument it is an historical
    fact that it is some time before morality and law are discriminated from one another
    mr grote points out the fact that in the homeric poems only the germ of the distinction
    between morality and law can be detected in a note volii p  he quotes nagelsbach
    ijomerische theologie abschn v p  as giving ajust and wellsustained view of the
    homeric ethics which is to the effect that it is their characteristic standpoint
    that the spheres of legal right morality and religiosity are not as yet at all
    disengaged from each otherso that a man for example could be just without being
    godlybut exist together in undeveloped unity they are only conceived of as distinct
    when by the advance ofmorality law stands out by itself as a rule distinct from
    moral and religious duty this advance is due to the fact of law realizing and
    fixing conceptions of right in rules of custom  while morality freely changes
    and amplifies them by reflection on a riper experience than gave them birth on
    the advance taking place it arose from the necessity of moral rules receiving
    their interpretation from legal dispositions that morality divided into two portionsthe
    one steady relative to law and creating a disposition to conform to it the other
    vague and contemplating better or more convenient dispositions of things than
    those realized by law it thus became in a twofold sense the auxiliary of law aiding
    at once in enforcing and improving it it is by the rereciprocal ciprocal influence
    of morality and other advanced forms ofinfluence opinion and law that the stability
    of the social progress is of lav  secured opinion steadied and excessive inequalities
    in the r allt y development of the classes of society prevented while criral j
    t on tical morality tends to improve popular conceptions and law thus to change
    the rules of law or custom the latter react on the former opinion in a state of
    fluidity in the front of experience is constantly washing the law in its centre
    of the impurities of the soil but these in turn enter into opinion and tone and
    colour it a most noticeable instance of this is pointed out by adam smith in the
    influence of custom on the opinions of plato and aristotle regarding the exposition
    of infants in the view of this reaction must be noticed the tendency to finality
    in morals as affecting the progress of law the temporary effect of assigning absoluteness
    to moral dogmas is to increase their authority  but the final effect is to disqualify
    them for carrying on the improvement of law critical morality in the critical
    relative form with the greatest happiness on the whole of morality society for
    its standard of right continues to be the auxiliary and guide of law because it
    aims at no more than investigating rules the true lessons of experience which
    on being discovered the instincts of men compel them to practise and in fact since
    circumstances and convenience determine law and law interprets the rules of morality
    it is impossible to make them absolute or universal except in point of form even
    the moral rulesbe just pure humanewhich being drawn from tiie essential institutions
    of society exist in the morality of every country in the same terms can have no
    greater generality than the corresponding rules of law purity in turkey is consistent
    with polygamy and humanity in america with the institution of slavery the relation
    of other forms of advanced opinion to the growth of law is for a large part the
    same as we have above indicated as subsisting between morality and law the progress
    effected resulting from the mutual actions of opinion on law and law on opinion
    when the progress has been carried on up to a certain point the action of advanced
    opinion becomes more immediate in its effects taking place on law itself instead
    of on popular dispositions this is when the legislative functions of government

  text: l a w legislathe general science but as mr mill observes the extln actness
    of science must give place to practical convenience and utility in the science
    of society as in astronomy  and there appears to be no good reason supposing cases
    can be found analogous to that of the moon where the effects though contributed
    to by many are principally due to one or two causes why in sociology as in astronomy
    there should not be isolated theories the approximate character of their conclusions
    not being lost sight of m comte however contends that the cases are not analogous
    and that in sociology the isolation of effects and their specific causes is strictly
    inadmissible such subdepartments of social science have notwithstanding been formed
    for instance political economy is isolated from general social science and devoted
    to the investigation of the laws of the creation and distribution of wealthits
    approximations resting on the operation of a single law of human nature that men
    prefer a greater gain to a smaller political among the subdepartments thus formed
    or projected is ethology political ethology mills logic of the moral sciences
    the science of the causes which determine the type of character belonging to a
    people or an age this science investigates the effects of institutions or social
    arrangements upon national character and conduct and thus corresponds immediately
    to the legislative art sociological problems come in one or other of two forms  given
    a certain general condition of social circumstances to determine the effect of
    a given cause  or  what are the laws which determine the circumstances themselves
    sociology as a science of tendencies answers the first by demonstrating the tendencies
    of particular causes under assumed conditions of circumstances when the actual
    conditions differ from these the practitioner recurring to the principles of the
    science must endeavour to take the omitted circumstances into account or to omit
    the superlative circumstances as the case may be it answers the second by investigating
    the laws by which one state of society generates another with regard to the first
    mr mill is of opinion that it would be an error to suppose that by deduction from
    the principles of human nature we could arrive at any great number of propositions
    which will be true in all societies without exception  such a supposition he says  would
    be inconsistent with the eminently modifiable nature of social phenomena and the
    multitude and variety of the circumstances by which they are modifiedcircumstances
    never the same or even nearly the same in too different societies or in two different
    periods of the same society every cause as its effects spread through society
    comes somewhere in contact with different sets of agencies and thus has its effects
    on some of the social phenomena differently modified and these differences by
    their reaction produce a difference even in those of the effects which would otherwise
    have been the same we can never therefore affirm with certainty that a cause which
    has a particular tendency in one people or in one age will have exactly the same
    tendency in another without referring back to our premises and performing over
    again for the second age or nation that analysis of the whole of its influencing
    circumstances which we had already performed for the first the deductive science
    of society does not lay down a theorem asserting in one universal manner the effect
    of any cause  but rather teaches us how to frame the proper theorem for the circumstances
    of any given case it does not give us the laws of society in general but the means
    of determining the phenomena of any given society from the particular elements
    or data of that society the consideration of the second form of the social problem
    is legislaless necessary to our purpose than that of the first and tion would
    lead farther into the methods of general social science than is consistent with
    the limits of this article it will by this time be seen that the function of sociology
    is to supply the legislator with general rules and principles for solving particular
    practical problems and that there can be no science of law separate from the science
    of society when the legislator has to act in any case he may consult the science
    as to the consequences of his acting in a given way or as to the way in which
    he should act to accomplish a proposed end  as to whether the end proposed is
    itself practicable and desirable or as to what end it would be most desirable
    to accomplish looking to the good of society legislation is the art of applying
    the middle principles of sociology and the general rules which it borrows from
    the science together with certain artprinciples of its own make up its whole theory
    ii it remains to consider the nature and limits of the modifications of social
    phenomena producible by legislative measures there are here two guiding principles
    that events subjected to invariable laws are susceptible of modification in proportion
    to their complexity  and  that the changes are producible by affecting their intensity
    and secondary operation but not their nature or filiation the postures into which
    an automaton may be thrown increase in number with the number of its joints while
    each joint definitely prescribes a peculiar motion to the portion of the figure
    in which it is situated and in a degree determines the fashion of all the postures
    when there are many joints an indefinite number of postures are readily producible
    while it is vain to attempt to throw the figure into any one for which a single
    joint would have to yield a motion contrary to its nature the case of a ship at
    sea moving between the points up to which it can be made to sail to the wind illustrates
    the same principles in this and every case of a combination of causes the producible
    modifications are more numerous and easily effected the more numerous the causes
    are and the ways in which they may be resolved so as to vary their joint effect  coming
    now to legislative action on the complex phenothe limits mena of society the former
    principle guarantees its facility of legislawhile the latter assigns its limits
    it may be stated in tlve actln general terms that it is limited by the sociological
    laws of harmony and succession and that within the limits prescribed by them it
    must operate by affecting their intensity and secondary operation this is no more
    than is intended by adam smith moral sentiments vol ii p  when in terms equally
    general he describes the man of system as going on  to establish his plan of government
    in every point as if he could arrange the members of a great society as he could
    arrange chessmen neglectful that each has a principle of motion of his own for
    the rest to quote m comte philosophic positive vol iv p   having ascertained the
    existence of general limits of variation peculiar to social phenomena and especially
    of the modifications dependent upon systematic political action and the scientific
    principle which is to give the character and limits of such modifications it belongs
    to the direct development of social science to determine in each case the influence
    and actual reach of this general principle by a special appreciation of the corresponding
    situation it is by such appreciations made empirically that those men of genius
    who have really exercised a great and profound influence on humanity in any way
    whatever have been guided  accepting the definition of evil that it is the result  of
    the nonadaptation of constitutions to conditions the consciousness of our power
    to modify phenomena so as to accommodate constitutions to conditions within certain
    limits must be accepted as the ultimate source of our feeling of responsibility
    the legislators duties and responsibilities unquestionably depend on his having
    the power to determine the course of social events more happily than they would
    he determined in the natural progress

    can be laid down on the subject that will not admit of exceptions many permanent
    some occasional but the clearest line of distinction that i could draw whilst

    to what regards the state or the creatures of the state namely the exterior establishment
    of its religion  its magistracy its revenue its military force by sea and land
    the corporations that owe their existence to its fiat in a word to every thing
    that is truly and properly public to the public peace to the public safety to

    which belongs to wisdom proceed only in this their supenor orb and first mover
    of their duty steadily vigilantly severely courageously  whatever remains will

    from a province to a parish and from a parish to a private house they go on accelerated
    in their fall they cannot do the lower duty and in proportion as they try it they
    will certainly fail in the higher they ought to know the different departments
    of things what belongs to laws and what manners alone can regulate to these great
    politicians can give a leaning but they cannot give a law our legislature has
    fallen into this fault as well as other governments all have fallen into it more

    too wide and general the fact is no general limits are here assignable as already
    stated the duty of the state must be pronounced on from case to case on an appreciation
    of the whole circumstances of cases and calculation of the probable effects on
    society of state interference with them iii jurisprudence and legislationwe must
    here for the sake of completeness give a brief account of the different senses
    in which the terms legislation and jurisprudence have been employed by different
    writers and indicate the division  of our subject which remain for discussion
    i he words jurisprudence and legislation have been employed in many senses legislation
    at one time denoted the science explaining the principles from which law ought
    to be universally derived and their application to particular countries recently
    it has been employed to represent that poition of the law of a state directly
    derived from the supreme authority in its legislative capacity and in this sense
    nnrdn ct s i jed z france from j uris prudence or that p rdon of the law derived
    from judicial decisions in the nt r f se  nse  a s a  n  legislation or the science
    of law as it   e has been distinguished from jurisprudence or law  the knowledge
    of law as it is austins province of jurislegislaprudence on the other hand jurisprudence
    or ins tion whewells elements of morality has both ot old andrecently been employed
    to signify the doctrine of rights and obligations or the science of law and legislation
    to signify the art of applying the principles of the science of law bentham fragment
    on government in this latter sense jurisprudence under the qualification of  natural
    or  universal has had various provinces assigned to it adam smith moral sentiments
    vol ii speaking of the civil and criminal laws of particular countries observes
    that the principles upon which those rules either are or ought to be founded are
    the subjectof the science of natural jurisprudence the same functions have been
    assigned by various writers to universal jurisprudence which again has been limited
    by others to the investigation of the principles common to the laws of all countries
    sir james mackintosh uses jurisprudence by itself in the sense assigned above
    to universal jurisprudence and again in a sense in which it is difficult to say
    whether he does not mean it to stand for the who e body of municipal law sir james
    mackintosh study of the law of nature and nations works vol i p  carmignani again
    uses the word legislation to signify  the science of establishing law and thus
    distinguishes it from jurisprudence or  the science of the application of law  and
    this is the sense in which mr james mill uses the word jurisprudence when he says
    that it has nothing to do with the constitution of rights or the adapting them
    to the requirement of universal benevolence but that its object is to show the
    best means of protecting rights that exist whatever they are not to dwell on the
    misuse of the word science in most of the above cited applications of these terms
    it has been shown that strictly there can be no science of law separate from the
    general science of sociology political ethology converts the theorems of social
    science into rules of policy and legislation is the art of applying these rules
    to particular cases and the general rules and maxims of policy derived from the
    science together with its peculiar art principles make up the whole theory of
    legislation the part of this theory derived from the science must differ for different
    societies as their states differ but the principles of lawmaking the art rules
    of legislationrest on the general laws of human nature and are everywhere the
    same the rules of jurisprudence have the same generality its principles being
    maxims of reason based on experience of what is essential to the protection of
    rights whatever they are parting here then with the theory of law as connected
    with social science and assuming the rights which ought to be established to be
    ascertained two topics remain for consideration  the mode of establishing rights
    to be considered under the head lawmaking and the mode of protecting rights to
    be considered under the head jurisprudence part iiilawmaking the legislature of

    he immediately applied himself to thepreparation of a second volume he lived to
    bring it to a conclusion though not to make any arrangement for its publication
    during the last years of his life his health appears to have been infirm and precarious

    of modern times was born at kirkcaldy on the th of june  his father who held the
    situation of comptroller of customs in that town died a few months before his
    birth so that the charge of his early education devolved wholly on his mother
    the daughter of mr douglas of strathenry in the county of fife his constitution
    during infancy is said to have been exit emely infirm and delicate and required
    all the anxious attention of his mother who treated him with greatest indulgence  his
    however had no unfavourable influence over his temper or dispositions and he repaid
    the fond solicitude of his parent by every attention that filial gratitude and
    affection could dictate during the long period of sixty years he received the
    rudiments of his education in the grammar school of kirkcaldy the weakness of
    his constitution prevented him from indulging in the amusements common to boys
    of his age but dugald stewart states that he was even then distinguished by his
    passion for books and by the extraordinary powers of his memory that he was much
    beloved by his schoolfellows many of whom subsequently attained to great eminence
    and that he was thus early remarkable for those habits which remained with him
    through life of speaking to himself when alone and of absence in company he continued
    at kirkcaldy until  when he was sent to the university of glasgow where he remained
    for three years he then entered balliol college oxford as an exhibitioner on snells
    foundation  and continued for seven years to prosecute his studies at that celebrated
    seminary mathematics and natural philosophy formed his favourite pursuits wfitile
    at glasgow but subsequently to his removal to oxford he seems to have principally
    devoted the time not consumed in the routine duty of the university to the study
    of the belles lettres and of those moral and political sciences of which he was
    destined to become so great a master smith does not seem to have felt any very
    peculiar respect for his english alma mater the severe remarks in the wealth of
    nations on the system of education followed in oxford and cambridge were suggested
    by his own observations he shows that it is reasonable to expect that the plan
    of appointing professors with handsome salaries who are not permitted to receive
    fees from their pupils should in all ordinary cases make them either wholly neglect
    the important duties of their office or discharge them in a slovenly manner  and
    he refers to the example of oxford to prove the accuracy of this conclusion   the
    greater part of the public professors of that seminary having for these many years
    given up altogether even the pretence of teaching while at oxford smith frequently
    employed himself in translating particularly from the french in the view of improving
    his style and he used often to express a favourable opinion of this sort of exercise
    but lie might have practised it with nearly equal advantage anywhere else no doubt
    however he must have reaped considerable advantage from his residence at oxford
    by its contributing to improve and perfect his acquaintance with the niceties
    of the english language and rendering him a greater proficient in classical learning
    of which his knowledge was both extensive and accurate but it is not perhaps very
    easy to discover what other obligations he could owe to it what advantage could
    he derive in prosecuting his inquiries respecting the history of society and  u '

  text: 'j smith smith adam and considered in this point of view the theory of moral
    sentiments is a highly original work having published the substance of so important
    a part of his lectures smith was enabled to make considerable retrenchments from
    the ethical part ot his course and to give a proportional extension to the disquisitions
    on jurisprudence and political economy he had long been in the habit of embodying
    the results of his studies and investigations with respect to both these departments
    of political science but particularly the latter in his lectures and it appears
    from a statement which he drew up in  to vindicate his claims to certain political
    and literary opinions that he had been in the habit of teaching from the time
    he obtained a chair in the university of glasgow and even when at edinburgh the
    same enlarged and liberal doctrines with respect to the freedom of industry and
    the injurious influence of restraints and regulations which he afterwards so fully
    established in the wealth of nations his residence in a large commercial and manufacturing
    city like glasgow gave him a considerable advantage in the prosecution of his
    favourite studies by affording means of easily obtaining that correct practical
    information on many points which cannot be found in books and by enabling him
    to compare his theoretical doctrines with the experimental conclusions of his
    mercantile friends notwithstanding the alleged disinclination of men of business
    to listen to speculative opinions and the opposition of his leading principles
    to the old maxims of trade he was able before leaving the university to rank some
    eminent merchants among his proselytes the publication of the theory of moral
    sentiments brought a vast accession of reputation to smith and placed him in the
    estimation of all who were qualified to form an opinion on such a subject in the
    first rank of moralists and of able and eloquent writers in  the senatus academicus
    of the university of glasgow unanimously conferred on him the honorary degree
    of doctor of laws  in testimony as it is expressed in the minutes of the meeting
    of their respect for his universally acknowledged talents and of the advantage
    that had resulted to the university from the ability with which he had for many
    years expounded the principles of jurisprudence but the most important effect
    of his increasing celebrity in so far at least as respected himself was his receiving
    in  an invitation from mr charles townshend who had married the widow of the earl
    of dalkeith to attend her ladyships son the young duke of buccleuch on his travels  and
    the advantageous terms that were offered combined with his strong desire to visit
    the continent induced him to accept the offer and to resign his chair at glasgow  with
    the connection which he was led to form in consequence of this change in his situation
    says stewart  he had reason to be satisfied in an uncommon degree and he alwavs
    spoke of it with pleasure and gratitude to the public it was not perhaps a change
    equally fortunate  as it interrupted that studious leisure for which nature seems
    to have destined him and in which alone he could have hoped to accomplish those
    literary projects smith which had flattered the ambition of his youthful genius
    adam smith set out for france in company with his noble pupil in march  they remained
    only a few days at paris on their first visit to that capital but proceeded to
    toulouse where they continued for about eighteen months this being a considerable
    city and at that time the seat of a parliament the society in it may be presumed
    to have been a good deal superior to that of most country towns and smith no doubt
    availed himself of it and of the leisure he then enjoyed to perfect and extend
    his knowledge of the literature internal policy and state of france he has told
    us that he was not disposed to place much confidence in the facts and reasonings
    of political arithmeticians  and it is evident from his rarely making statements
    on the authority of others and from his occasionally referring to circumstances
    connected with toulouse geneva and other places which he visited that he was chiefly
    indebted to his own observation and inquiries for his extensive information in
    regard to the institutions habits and condition of the french people  after leaving
    toulouse smith and his noble pupil proceeded to geneva where they resided two
    months they returned to paris at christmas  and remained there for nearly a year
    during the whole of this period smith lived on an intimate footing with the best
    society in that city to which his friendship with hume greatly facilitated his
    introduction turgot afterwards comptrollergeneral of finance dalembert helvetius
    marraontel the abbe morellet  the duke of la rochefoucault count sarsfield buffon
    the baron dholbach madame riccoboni mademoiselle de lespinasse c were of the number
    of his acquaintances and some of them he continued ever after to reckon among
    his friends he was also on familiar terms with quesnay the author of the economical
    theory and there is every reason to think that he derived considerable advantage
    from his intercourse with that able and excellent person than whom none was better
    qualified to strike out original and ingenious views so sensible indeed was smith
    of his merits as a man and a philosopher that he intended had he not been prevented
    by quesnays death to have left a lasting testimony of the high place which he
    held in his estimation by dedicating to him the wealth of nations s in october  the
    duke of buccleuch accompanied by smith returned to london the latter soon after
    removed to his old residence at kirkcaldy w here he remained with little interruption
    for about ten years habitually occupied in study and in the elaboration of his
    great work this however was not a tak but a labour of love labor ipse voluptas
    in a letter to hume written in  he says  my business here is study in which i
    have been deeply engaged for about a month past my amusements are long and solitary
    walks by the seaside you may judge how i spend my time i feel myself however extremely
    happy comfortable and contented i never was perhaps more so in my life you will
    give me great comfort by  smith did not assume this distinction in private life
    but contented himself with printing it on the titles of his works he had in truth
    little or no respect for academical honours which he has characterised in very
    depreciatory terms  it has always appeared to us as a singular and not easily
    explained fact that notwithstanding their familiar acquaintance with the state
    of france we do not find either in hume or smith any anticipation how faint soever
    of the tremendous convulsion of which that country was at no distant period the
    theatre and yet it had given numerous and those not obscure indications of its
    approach it is curious that what had thus escaped the observation of the two most
    eminent philosophers of the age should have been clearly discerned and pointed

    among my friends in london and so with a few v short intervals he went on till
    in  an aera that will be for ever memorable in the history of political philosophy
    the inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations was given to the
    world we have elsewhere examined most part of the leading theories and conclusions
    advanced in this famous work see introduction to article political economy at
    present it is enough to observe that despite its imperfections in a scientific
    point of view the objections that have been made and not without justice to its
    arrangement and the many changes that have taken place since its publication in
    the policy and condition of nations its celebrity is in no degree diminished it
    is not in truth a book for one country or one age but for all countries and all
    ages and will always be regarded as a noble monument of profound thinking various
    learning and persevering research applied to purposes of the highest interest
    and importance little needs be said in regard to the originality of the theories
    advanced by smith we have shown in the article referred to that some of the most
    important doctrines embodied in the wealth of nations had been distinctly announced
    and that traces more or less faint of the remainder may be found in various wmrks
    published previously to its appearance but this has little or nothing to do with
    the peculiar merits of smith  and in no respect invalidates his claim to be considered
    as the real founder of the science of political economy some of its disjecta membra
    had indeed been discovered with indications of the others but their importance
    whether in a practical or scientific point of view and their dependence on each
    other were all but wholly unknown they formed an undigested mass without order
    or any sort of rational connection what was sound and true being frequently as
    in the theory of the economists closely linked to what was false and contradictory
    smith was the enchanterwho educed order out of this chaos  e tenebris tantis tam
    clarutn extollere lumen qui primus potuisti inlustrans commoda vitae and in such
    complicated and difficult subjects a higher degree of merit belongs to the party
    who first establishes the truth of a new doctrine and traces its consequences
    and limitations than to him who may previously have stumbled upon it by accident
    and dismissed it as if it were valueless he did not like the greater number of
    his predecessors build his conclusions on metaphysical abstractions or on the
    partial and distorted statements of interested or prejudiced parties but on a
    careful review and analysis of the more prominent circumstances connected with
    the progress of society from antiquity down to his own times and none will be
    surprised that in taking for the first time so wide a survey he sometimes overlooked
    a principle or was deceived in regard to its influence or operation and that in
    consequence some parts of his book are defective or erroneous this however is
    but rarely the case he had none of that impetuous rashness which while it satisfies
    itself with hasty and superficial investigations pushes with unhesitating confidence
    every theory however narrow or illfounded to an extreme on the contrary he was
    slow and circumspect and without seeking to establish new doctrines was influenced
    by a sincere desire to trace and discover the natural and sound principles of
    public economy however  obscured by sophistry or encumbered by error and to exhibit
    what he believed would be found to be their practical working if allowed to come
    into free operation in pursuing his laborious inquiries his caution and his unequalled
    sagacity never forsook him and the real wonder is that a work involving so many
    abstruse researches and conflicting considerations as that of smith should have
    so few blemishes and be so nearly perfect as we find it to be it contains a greater
    number of useful and readily available truths than are to be found in any other
    publication and it pointed out and smoothed the path by following which subsequent
    inquirers have been able to perfect much which its author left incomplete to rectify
    the mistakes into which he fell and to make many new and important discoveries
    whether indeed we refer to the soundness of its leading doctrines the liberality
    and universal applicability of its practical conclusions or the powerful and beneficial
    influence it has had on the progress of economical science and on the policy and
    conduct of nations the wealth of nations must be placed in the foremost rank of
    those works which have helped to liberalise enlighten and enrich mankind  by showing
    that the real and lasting interests of nations are always best promoted by cultivating
    a fair and friendly intercourse with their neighbours and that the jealousies
    and fears that were formerly entertained of the advance of others in wealth and
    civilisation are as unfounded as they are malevolent and base the wealth of nations
    has contributed in no ordinarydegree to weaken national antipathies and to lessen
    the chances of war its influence in this respect has been well illustrated by
    mr buckle who does not hesitate to affirm that  adam smith contributed more by
    the publication of this single work towards the happiness of man than has been
    effected by the united abilities of all the statesmen and legislators of whom
    history has preserved an authentic account  hume who was then labouring under
    his last illness addressed a congratulatory letter to smith on the publication
    of the wealth of nations and it is a curious fact that he pointed out in that
    letter what is the principal defect of the work viz the erroneous view which it
    gives of the nature and causes of rent he says i cannot think that the rent of
    farms makes any part of the price of produce it is not known whether hume had
    directly arrived at this conclusion or had derived it at second band from the
    writings or conversation of dr anderson  by whom it had been already established
    but it is singular seeing that his attention had been directed to tbe subject
    by one he so greatly esteemed that smith did not submit his statements in regard
    to rent to a more searching and caieful analysis had he done this he would most
    probably have adopted the views of anderson and hume and materially improved his
    work  smith survived the publication of the wealth of lsations fifteen years he
    had the satisfaction to see it translated into all the languages of europe to
    hear his opinions quoted in the house of commons to be consulted by the minister
    and to observe that the principles he had expounded smith adam  history of civilization

    found means to effect his escape from the arrest and during nine months concealed
    himself in paris but at length dreading that the tyrant would order a domiciliary
    visit for the purpose of discovering the place of his retreat he passed through
    the barriers without being noticed and went to the house of a person in whom he
    confided on the plain of montrouge unfortunately for condorcet however this friend
    was at that time in the metropolis and he was in consequence reduced to the necessity
    of passing two dreary nights in the open fields a prey to hunger and cold on the
    third day he obtained an interview with his friend who unhappily durst not venture
    to shelter him under his roof so that he was once more compelled to wander in
    the fields at length worn out by hunger and fatigue and on the point of perishing
    for want of sustenance he applied at a public house for an omelette which he obtained
    and devoured greedily his cadaverous appearance and uncommonly keen appetite roused

    and hesitation which characterized his answers when interrogated justified his
    apprehension he was accordingly consigned to a dungeon to be next day conducted

  text: k a kant published the full work in kbnigsberg idle government wlio were probably
    as much influenced by hatred and fear of the french revolution of which kant was
    supposed to be a partizan as by love of orthodoxy resented the act and a secret
    cabinet order was received by him intimating the displeasure of the king frederick
    william ii and exacting from him a pledge not to lecture or write at all on religious
    subjects in future with this mandate kant after a struggle complied and kept his
    engagement till  when the death of the king according to his construction of his
    promise set him free this incident however produced a very unfavourable effect
    on his spirits he withdrew in  from society  next year he gave up all his classes
    but one public lecture on logic or metaphysics  and in  before the removal of
    the interdict on his theological teaching he ceased altogether his public labours
    after an academic course of  years he had previously in the same year finished
    his two treatises on the laic of nature and on practical morals which with his
    anthropology completed in  were the last considerable works which he revised with
    his own hand his iectures on logic and on physical geography were edited during
    his lifetime by his friends and pupils by way of asserting his right to resume
    theological disquisition he also issued in  his strife of the faculties in which
    all the strongest parts of his work on religion were urged afresh and the correspondence
    that had passed between himself and his censors was given to the world from the
    date of his retirement from the chair kant declined in strength and gave tokens
    of intellectual decay his protest against fichte published in  is perhaps to be
    traced to this cause and he manifested other signs of uneasiness at the revolt
    of his former disciples from his authority his memory began to fail and a large
    work at which he wrought night and day on the connection between physics and metaphysics
    was found to be only a repetition of his already published doctrines after  finding
    himself attacked with a weakness in the limbs attended with frequent fits of falling
    he mitigated a little the spartan severity of his life and also consented to receive
    medical advice a constant restlessness oppressed him  his sight gave way  his
    conversation became an extraordinary mixture of metaphors  and it was only at
    intervals that gleams of his former power broke out especially when some old chord
    of association was struck in natural science or physical geography a few days
    before his decease with a great effort he thanked his medical attendant for his
    visits in the words  i have not yet lost my feeling for humanity on the th of
    february  he breathed his last having almost completed the eightieth year of his
    age it is superfluous to characterize the genius of kant but a few words may be
    added as to his personal appearance and habits of life study and teaching his
    stature was small and his appearance feeble he was little more than five feet
    high his breast was almost concave and like schleiermacher he was deformed in
    the right shoulder his hair was light his complexion fresh his forehead high and
    square while his eye of light blue showed an expression of unusual depth and power
    his senses were quick and delicate and though of weak constitution he escaped
    by strict regimen all serious illness till the close of life his life was arranged
    with mechanical regularity and as he never married he kept the habits of his studious
    youth to old age his manservant awoke him summer and winter at five oclock and
    on being appealed to on one occasion testified that kant had not once failed in
    thirty years to respond to the call he studied after rising for two hours then
    lectured other two and spent the rest of the forenoon till one at his desk he
    then dined at a restaurant which he frequently changed to avoid the influx of
    n t  strangers who crowded to see and hear himtill in later kant years his growing
    means enabled him to invite a friend or two daily to his own home this was his
    only regular meal and as he loved the ducere ccenam of the romans he often prolonged
    the conversation till late in the afternoon he then walked out for at least an
    hour in all weathers and spent the evening in lighter reading except an hour or
    two devoted to the preparation of his next days lectures after which he retired
    between nine and ten to rest the furniture of his house w r as of the simplest
    character and though he left a considerable sum the produce of his writings to
    his relatives he indulged in no luxury and was a pattern of that superiority to
    fashion and appearance so often met with in the literary life of germany in his
    earlier years he often spent his evenings in general society where his overflowing
    knowledge and conversational talents made him the life of every party he was especially
    intimate with thetamilies of two english merchants of the name of green and motherby
    where he found many opportunities of meeting shipcaptains and other travelled
    persons and thus gratifying his passion for physical geography this social circle
    included also the celebrated hamannthe magus of the norththe friend of herder
    and jacobi who was thus a mediator between kant and these philosophical adversaries
    kants reading was of the most extensive and miscellaneous kind he cared comparatively
    little for the history of speculation being in this department more a discoverer
    than a scholar but his acquaintance with books of science general history travels
    and belles lettres was boundless he was well versed in english literature chiefly
    of the age of queen anne and had read english philosophy from locke to hume and
    the scottish school he was at home in voltaire and rousseau but shows little acquaintance
    with the french sensational philosophy fie was familiar with all german literature
    up to the date of his critique but ceased to follow it in its great development
    by goethe and schiller it was his habit to obtain books in sheets from his publishers
    kanter and nicolovius  and he read over for many years all the new works in their
    catalogue in order to keep abreast of universal knowledge he was excessively fond
    of newspapers and works on politics  and this was the only kind of reading that
    could interrupt his studies in philosophy as a lecturer kant avoided altogether
    that rigid style in which his books were written and which was only meant for
    thinkers by profession he sat behind a low desk with a few jottings on slips of
    paper or textbooks marked on the margin before him and delivered an extemporaneous
    address opening up the subject by partial glimpses and with many digressions and
    interspersed anecdotes or familiar illustrations till a complete idea of it was
    presented his voice was extremely weak but sometimes rose into eloquence and always
    commanded perfect silence like adam smith he fixed his eye on one student and
    marked by his countenance whether the lecture was understood the least irregularity
    in the appearance or dress of this selected hearer disconcerted him and the story
    is well known of the missing button which defeated a lecture though kind to his
    students he refused on principle to remit their fees as this he thought would
    discourage independence it was another principle that his chief exertions should
    be bestowed on the intermediate class of talent as the geniuses would help themselves
    and the dunces were beyond remedy hence he never delivered his deeper doctrines
    such as are found in his critique from the chair his other avocations allowed
    him little personal intercourse with his numerous hearers and he often complained
    of the want of lively sympathy and ascertained progress inseparable from such
    a system simple honourable truthful kindhearted and highf

    th of april  in his early youth being of feeble health he was sent when four years
    old to a school kept by an old woman and afterwards to a higher school he received
    his first lessons in mathematics from his father and his eldest brother and a
    slight knowledge of latin at a school in the neighbouring town of leven which
    he attended for six months the first person of any note who observed his precocious
    attainments was mr oliphant who became minister of largo about the time when the
    boy had reached his eleventh or twelfth year struck with his knowledge of mathematical
    and physical science he kindly lent him some scientific books and he also strongly
    urged him but without avail to resume the study of latin for which he entertained
    at this time a strong aversion he also became known to professors robinson and
    stewart of edinburgh  and by their advice he was in his thirteenth year sent to
    the university of st andrews to study mathematics under professor vilant on examination
    by the professor he was found already qualified for the second or senior class
    and at the close of the session he obtained a prize and attracted the notice of
    the earl of kinnoull then chancellor of the university who proposed to his father
    to defray the expense of his sons education on the condition that he should study
    for the church the proposal was readily embraced and as a knowledge of latin was
    now imperative he commenced doggedly to study it and by the aid of a private teacher
    qualified himself for entering the humanity class he also seems to have got rid
    of his strong dislike to the language for no trace of it remained in his after
    life and he is extremely fond of introducing classical quotations in his writings
    his continued success during his second session secured the continued patronage
    of the chancellor who invited him to dupplin castle about the same time began
    his acquaintance with playfair and dr small in  or  he quitted st andrews and
    along with his fellowstudent james ivory proceeded to edinburgh where though he
    formally entered the divinity hall he contrived to devote his first session to
    the sciences particularly to chemistry in fact he seems early to have relinquished
    all thoughts of the church a resolution perhaps hastened by the death of his patron
    the earl of kinnoull soon after his removal to edinburgh he continued to study
    here till the close of the session of  and as is customary with students of his
    limited means devoted part of his time to private tuition acting as tutor to a
    young man nearly related to adam smith he thus became known to that philosopher
    who treated him kindly and occasionally favoured him with directions as to his
    own pursuits his first essay  on the resolution of indeterminate problems composed
    about this time was read to the royal society of leslie edinburgh by mr playfair
    in  and published in their ir john transactions for  in  he accompanied in the
    capacity of tutor two young students of the name of randolph to virginia here
    his agreeable and profitable sojourn was brought to an end after the lapse of
    little more than a year by the death of the father ot his young friends  and after
    visiting new york and philadelphia he returned to his native place towards the
    close of the year  from some letters to his family written about the time of his
    leaving america he seems to have meditated trying his fortune in india probably
    as a civil engineer a notion that recurred afterwards without leading to any results
    in january  carrying among other letters of recommendation one from adam smith
    he repaired to london chiefly for the purpose of ascertaining what success he
    might expect from a course of lectures on natural philosophy and the information
    he received soon satisfied him as he says in a letter to one of his brothers that  rational
    lectures would not succeed he therefore employed himself for some time in writing
    for the monthly review and in executing literary jobs delegated to him by his
    countryman dr william thomson author of the continuation of watsons history of
    philip the third in april  he became tutor to his former fellowstudents the younger
    wedgewoods of etruria in staffordshire where he remained till the close of  in

    undertaken for a london bookseller it was published in  in  vols vo though executed
    with fidelity and vigour it was valued by himself in after life solely for having
    by the sum which it procured him laid the foundation of that pecuniary competency
    which his industrious and prudent habits soon enabled him in a moderate degree
    to attain in  after a sojourn of some months in holland during which he acquired

    his differential thermometer a contrivance suggested during his attempts to construct

    coins are treated of under money l s coinage money is a measure of value and medium
    of exchange  coinage is the art of fabricating money so soon as nations emerge
    from a state of barbarism when simple barter no longer suffices to meet their
    wants they will invent some common or conventional measure of value by which to
    exchange their products and carry on their commerce in the rude ages of society
    cattle are said to have been the common medium of commerce and among the patriarchs
    of old they were the measure of mans wealth and greatness the armour of diomede
    says homer cost only nine oxen  but that of glaucus cost a hundred oxen in some
    countries in former times salt was the measure of value and instrument of exchange
    and in others shells formed the circulating medium but as the necessities of nations
    multiply and their commercial transactions extend they soon discover the inadequacy
    of these means and will search for something of a more steady and durable character
    which shall serve both as a circulating medium as well as a medium of exchange
    with other countries trading with them from a very early period metals as possessing
    that character in a high degree were chosen to perform these important functions
    they are not only less perishable than other articles but they can without loss
    be divided into any number of parts and be united again by fusion  they can be
    hammered or rolled into plates and moulded into any shape and occupying less bulk
    than other articles they are easily transported from place to place  different
    metals says adam smith  have been made use of by different nations for this purpose
    iron was the common instrument of commerce among the ancient spartans copper among
    the ancient romans and gold and silver among all rich and commercial nations those
    metals seem originally to have been made use of for this purpose in rude bars
    without any stamp or coinage thus we are told by pliny upon the authority of timgeus
    an ancient historian that till the time of servius tullius the romans had no coined
    money but made use of unstamped bars of copper to purchase whatever they had occasion
    for these rude bars therefore performed at this time the function of money before
    the invention of coined money the precious metals were exchanged by weight only
    but as many obvious inconveniences attended that custom as an initiatory step
    pieces of metal rudely shaped were stamped with their weight and then by degrees
    the art of coining money was introduced intended not only to indicate by the stamp
    of the sovereign authority the weight but also the fineness of the coin so long
    as copper and iron performed the functions of money and measure of value probably
    the weight only was the test of value but with regard to gold and silver another
    element enters into their appreciation of as much consequence as the weight itself
    the quality or fineness of these metals by which the value is determined can only
    be discovered by the laborious process of assay and therefore as adam smith remarks
    before the institution of coined money unless this tedious and difficult operation
    were undertaken people must always have been liable to the grossest frauds and
    impositions and instead of a pound weight of pure silver might receive in exchange
    for their goods an adulterated composition of the coarsest and cheapest materials
    to guard the public against such frauds to facilitate exchanges and thereby encourage
    industry and commerce mints were established in which pieces of metal of determinate
    weight and fineness were stamped by public authority in order to declare the quantity
    and uniform goodness of the money so stamped that it should pass from hand to
    hand without doubt or suspicion in early times these coins or pieces of metal
    constituted or denoted weights of different denominations or in other words they
    expressed the weight or quantity of metal contained in them as in the roman as
    or pondo which when money was first coined at rome signified a pound weight of
    good copper consisting of twelve ounces as in our troy pound so the english pound
    sterling originally expressed not a coin exchangeable into  shillings but simply
    a pound weight of silver of sterling fineness the french livre likewise contained
    in the reign of charlemagne a pound weight of silver of a determinate quality
    and on the authority of adam smith the scots moneypound contained from the time
    of alexander i to that of robert bruce a pound of silver of the same weight and
    fineness with the english pound sterling english french and scots pennies too
    contained all of them originally a real pennyweight of silver or gtstli of a pound
    the shilling also seems originally to have been the denomination of a weight and
    not of a coin of conventional value as the transition from mere barter by which
    one product of labour is exchanged for another to the use of metals as instruments
    of commerce indicates an advance in civilization  so the transition from the latter
    to the fabrication of coined money however rude and inartificial at first marks
    another progressive step in culture and refinement while the various designs impressed
    on the coin and the mode of manufacture testify in nice degrees the slow advancement
    of society in art taste and ingenuity an inquiry therefore into the coinage of
    a country like great britain from the earliest times possesses an interest apart
    from the subject itself as a mere antiquarian research because it throws an indirect
    ray of lighten the social condition of the people from age to age and enables
    us to note the progressive steps of their improvement in taste refinement and
    mechanical invention as well as to ascertain their comparative wealth and social
    comfort indicated by the value of the necessary articles of life the subject partakes
    not indeed of the true dignity and importance of history  but in a less ambitious
    channel of research it is not without utility and instruction in order to illustrate
    the necessary connection that exists between the social and political condition
    of a nation and its coinage we need only to refer to the rude illfashioned coins

    should be borne by the public to meet this a tax on glass windows was subsequently
    raised to the amount of l in order to facilitate and hasten the exchange of coin
    a reward of  per cent was offered to all who should bring in either milled or
    broad undipped money to be applied in exchange of the clipped money throughout
    the kingdom a reward of d an ounce was also offered to all persons w r ho should
    bring wrought plate to the mint to be coined a bill was likewise brought in for
    taking off the obligation and encouragement for coining guineas for a certain
    period  upon which says hume  the commons proceeded to lower the value of this
    coin a task in which they met with great opposition from some members who alleged
    that it would foment the popular disturbances at length however the majority agreed
    that a guinea should be lowered from s to s and afterwards to s eventually a clause
    was inserted in the bill for encouraging people to bring plate to the mint settling
    the price of a guinea at s and it naturally sunk to its original value of s d
    in the great controversy on the restoration of the currency at that time mr lowndes
    who differed from mr locke wished to execute the coinage at a rate per ounce conformable
    to the market price of silver so that the new currency we apprehend should form
    the standard of value overlooking the fact that the market price exceeding the
    mint price arose from the deficiency in the weight of those coins by which silver
    was bought and sold  mr locke says a writer on the subject  with that acuteness
    for which he was so justly esteemed contended that if s d of the coin weighed
    an ounce that would necessarily be the market price of silver and that its high
    price arose from s d of the then currency containing no more than an ounce of
    standard silver consequently if the coinage were executed at a higher rate than
    the standard of the th of elizabeth or s d an ounce it would be done at the expense
    of that justice and integrity between the government and the people which no government
    would sanction that regarded the rights of personal property mr lockes arguments
    were so decidedly just and so convincing that the government carried the whole
    nation with them in the measure though it was heavily felt owing to the exhausted
    state of the country after the long and expensive war it had been involved in
    despite lockes arguments and the policy founded upon them soon after the great
    coinage was completed the market price exceeded the mint price of silver  the
    consequence of which was the rapid disappearance of the new coins which found
    their way to the meltingpot and were sold in bars in the market hence before the
    year  the greater portion of the recoinage had disappeared from circulation to
    the detriment of the realm sir isaac newton in september  delivered in his report
    on the subject to the lords of the treasury in which he gives it as his opinion
    that gold was considerably overrated in the mint with respect to silver and in
    consequence of this report the guinea was by proclamation declared current at
    s this reduction helped the relative proportion of gold to silver to approximate
    nearer to those of the market prices  and as the avowed intention of newtons report
    was to give that rise in value to the silver coin which would protect it from
    being melted down it appears to have answered its purpose but only in degree for  though
    the recommendation in sir isaac newtons report says the above authority  was carried
    into effect by making the guinea current at s yet it did not restore silver to
    its function as the standard of our money and this because the current value was
    not made lower sir isaac newton seemed aware of this himself and recommended that
    lod or d should be taken from the guinea instead ofd this coinage however was
    not done  and as the rate of  s to the guinea the proportion of standard gold
    to silver at the mint was as  to  the proportion of the market as we find by the
    prices of gold and silver was about  to which constitutes a difference of about  per
    cent gold being still thus much rated above its value to silver and consequently
    not only was no silver coined but the good and heavy coins were still melted for
    the higher price they brought in the state of bullion no other legislative measure
    having been taken than the one referred to and the market proportion of gold to
    silver having seldom afforded any encouragement to the public to coin silver we
    can have no difficulty in assigning a satisfactory reason for the degraded state
    of our silver currency during the last century and up to  in the year  and onwards
    there was a general rerecoinage coinage of the gold currency which forms another
    promiof gold nent feature in the history of the mint the professed ob ject of
    this undertaking was the reformation of the currency by withdrawing the light
    and defective coins then in circulation  but the real motive was to prevent if
    possible the new and heavy coins issued from the mint being melted down and sold
    as bullion for by reference to the prices paid by the bank of england for gold
    it appears that s an ounce was the market value while at the same time l of the
    gold coin then circulating would not weigh more than one ounce the holders of
    banknotes demanded in payment new and heavy coins which were immediately turned
    into bullion and sold at the rate of s an ounce  and this being done on an extensive
    scale the bank was compelled to have annually a large coinage of gold to meet
    the demand to remedy this inconvenience the recoinage was undertaken and completed
    and it had the effect anticipated  for the price of gold since that period has
    rarely ever exceeded but has generally been under the mint price in truth as the
    price at which the bank purchases gold is fixed by act of parliament and as the
    bank is compelled to buy all gold tendered to it at the price of s d an ounce
    standard some naturally enough question the fact that we have any market price
    for gold bullion in england there cannot be a doubt however but for that law the
    price of gold would have fluctuated as other things according to the supply and
    demand and it cannot but be deemed a great benefit to commercial interests to
    have by means so simple a ready and constant market for their bullion at a price
    regular and certain political economists disagree as to the cause of the high
    price of gold previously to the recoinage referred to that eminent authority adam
    smith offers the following solution  by issuing too great a quantity of paper
    of which the excess was continually returning in order to be exchanged for gold
    and silver the bank of england was for many years together obliged to coin gold
    to the extent of between eight hundred thousand and a million ayear or at an average
    about eight hundred and fifty thousand pounds for this great coinage the bank
    in consequence of the worn and degraded state into which the gold coin had fallen
    a few years ago was obliged frequently to purchase bullion at the high price of
    l an ounce which it soon after issued in coin at l s gd an ounce losing in this
    manner between and  per cent upon the coinage of so very large a sum though the
    bank therefore paid no seignorage though the government was properly at the expense
    of the coinage this liberality of government did not prevent altogether the expense
    of the bank upon this passage ricardo justly remarks  on the principle above stated
    it appears most clear that by not reissuing the paper thus brought in the value
    of the whole currency of the degraded as well as the new gold coin would have
    been raised when all demands on the bank would have ceased or in

  text: combination combinaemancipated from the restraints of the law should endeavour
    to avail themselves of what was supposed to be the powerful resource of combination
    it should also be borne in mind that a large number of individuals began immediately
    to perceive that whatever might be their influence in other respects combinations
    might be turned to good account by those by whom they were organized and managed
    but apart from the peculiar interests of such parties it was but reasonable to
    suppose that for a while at least combinations would be in high favour with the
    workingclasses and that nothing but experience would suffice to convince them
    of their generally ruinous tendency although however we regret and condemn many
    of the proceedings of the workmen we are very far from thinking that they form
    any valid reason either for the revival of the combination act or for the enactment
    of any similar statute nothing can apparently be more reasonable than that workmen
    should be allowed freely to combine or associate together for the purpose of adjusting
    the terms on which they will sell their labour wages like every thing else should
    always be left to be regulated by the fair and free competition of the parties
    in the market without being interfered with by the legislature  the property says
    adam smith  which every man has in his own labour as it is the original foundation
    of all other property so it is the most sacred and inviolable the patrimony of
    a poor man lies in the strength and dexterity of his hands  and to hinder him
    from employing this strength and dexterity in what manner he thinks proper without
    injury to his neighbours is a plain violation of the most sacred property but
    workmen are not allowed freely to dispose of their labour if they be prevented
    from concerting with each other the terms on which they will sell it capacity
    to labour is to the poor what stock is to the capitalists now a hundred or a thousand
    capitalists may form themselves into a company or combination take all their measures
    in common and dispose of their property as they may in their collective capacity
    judge most advantageous for their interestsand why should not a hundred or a thousand
    labourers be allowed to do the same by their stock  of all the varieties of property
    which a man can possess the faculties of his mind and the powers of his body are
    most particularly his own and to fetter him in the mode in which he is to exercise
    or dispose of these faculties and powers is a manifest encroachment on the most
    inviolable of all rights and can be justified only by an overwhelming necessity
    it is easy however to show that in point of fact no such necessity ever did or
    can exist the wages of any set of workmen who enter into a combination for the
    purpose of raising them must be either below the natural and proper rate of wages
    in the branch of industry to which they belong or c they must be coincident with
    that rate or above it now it is clear that in the first case or when wages are
    depressed below their natural level the claim of the workmen for an advance is
    fair and reasonable  and it would obviously be unjust and oppressive to prevent
    them from adopting any measure not injurious to the rights of others which they
    may think best fitted to render their claim effectual but a voluntary combination
    among workmen is certainly in no respect injurious to any right of their masters
    it is a contradiction to pretend that masters have any right or title to the services
    of free workmen in the event of the latter not choosing to accept the price offered
    them for their labour and as the existence of a combination to procure a rise
    of wages shows that they have not so chosen and is a proof of the want of all
    concord and agreement between the parties so it is also a proof that the workmen
    are fairly entitled to enter into it and that however injurious their proceedings
    may be to themselves they do not encroach on the privileges or rights of others
    not only therefore is a voluntary combination unaccompanied by violence a fair
    exercise of the combinaright of judging for themselves on the part of workmen
    tion but when it is entered into for the purpose of raising wages that are unduly
    depressed its object is proper and desirable few masters willingly consent to
    raise wages and the claim of one or a few individuals for an advance of wages
    is likely to be disregarded so long as their fellows continue to work at the old
    rates it is only when the whole or the greater part of the workmen belonging to
    a particular master or department of industry combine together or when they act
    in that simultaneous manner which is equivalent to a combination and refuse to
    continue to work without receiving an increase of wages that it becomes the immediate
    interest of the masters to comply with their demand and hence it is obvious that
    without the existence either of an open and avowed or of a tacit and real combination
    workmen would not be able to obtain a rise of wages by their own exertions but
    would be left to depend on the competition of their masters it is however abundantly
    certain that this competition will always raise wages that have been unduly depressed
    and it was from not adverting to this fact that the influence of the combination
    laws in depressing wages was so very greatly exaggerated if the wages paid to
    the labourers in a particular employment be improperly reduced the capitalists
    who carry it on obviously gain the whole amount of this reduction over and above
    the common and ordinary rate of profit obtained by the capitalists who carry on
    other employments but a discrepancy of this kind cannot be of long continuance
    additional capital immediately begins to be attracted to the department where
    wages are low and profits high and its owners are obliged in order to obtain labourers
    to offer them higher wages it is clear therefore that if wages be unduly reduced
    in any branch of industry they will be raised to their proper level without any
    effort on the part of the workmen by the competition of the capitalists and looking
    generally at the various employments carried on in the country we do not believe
    that the combination laws had any sensible influence over the average and usual
    rate of wages that they occasionally kept them at a lower rate in some very confined
    businesses than they would otherwise have sunk to may be true though for that
    very reason they must have equally elevated them in others this however is no
    good reason why the workmen engaged in employments in which wages happen from
    any cause to be unduly depressed should be prohibited from adopting the only means
    in their power of doing themselves justice when they are allowed freely to combine
    their combination may occasion an immediate rise of wages but when their combination
    is prevented more or less time must always elapse before the high profits caused
    by the undue reduction of wages become generally known and consequently before
    capital can be attracted from other businesses and hence it is clear that every
    attempt to prevent combination in such cases as this is neither more nor less
    than an attempt to hinder workmen from making use of the only means by which their
    wages can be speedily and effectually raised to their just level it is committing
    injustice in behalf of the strong at the expense of the weaker party we admit
    that the object of the second class of voluntary combinations or of those which
    take place when the wages of the combining workmen are already equal to or above
    their natural and proper rate is improper and unreasonable still however it is
    easy to see that there is no more cause for the interference of the legislature
    in this case than in the former there is no good reason why workmen should not
    like the possessors of every other valuable and desirable article be allowed to
    set whatever price they please upon their labour if they combine to raise wages
    beyond their natural limits or to enforce vexatious or improper condi

  text: combination  onibinations in regard to their employment it is all but certain
    tion that their combination will be unsuccessful it may be  taken for granted
    that the masters will resist any really improper demand and the slightest glance
    at the relative condition of the parties must satisfy every one that supposing
    them to be in earnest in their opposition they can hardly fail to succeed in defeating
    it the workmen always suffer more from a strike than the masters it is indeed
    true as adam smith has observed that in the long run they are as necessary to
    their masters as their masters are to them but this necessity is far from being
    so immediate the stock and credit of the master are in almost every instance much
    greater than the stock and credit of his labourers  and he is therefore able to
    maintain himself for a much longer time without their labour than they can maintain
    themselves without his wages in oldsettled and fullypeopled countries wages are
    seldom so high as to enable labourers to accumulate any considerable stock and
    though the scanty funds of those engaged in strikes are frequently eked out by
    contributions from the workpeople in other businesses and in other parts of the
    kingdom the combination never fails provided the masters do not give way to break
    to pieces it is also evident that when workmen enter into a combination to enforce
    an unreasonable demand or to raise wages that are already up to the common level
    they can gain nothing but must lose by entering into other employments to which
    they have not been bred while it is equally evident that a small extra sum will
    be sufficient to entice other labourers to the business they have left all the
    great departments of industry have so many closely allied branches that a workman
    who is instructed in any of them can without much training or difficulty apply
    himself to some of the others and thus the workmen who enter into the combination
    will not only fail of their object and be obliged to return to their work but
    owing to the influx of other labourers into their business during the strike they
    will probably be compelled to accept of a lower rate of wages than they previously
    enjoyed many extensive combinations have been broken up by the masters acting
    on this principle or by their bringing workpeople from other districts or other
    businesses to supply the place of those in the combination at first these workpeople
    may not be so skilful or expert as those who have seceded but these deficiencies
    soon become insensible and are more than compensated by the greater command the
    masters have over the new hands who it is commonly stipulated shall not enter
    into any union or association with other workmen for the purpose of raising wages
    regulating the hours of work c the combination of the coal miners of the north
    in  when about  hands struck for a modification of the conditions under which
    they had previously been employed and an advance of wages though one of the most
    formidable that has hitherto existed was defeated in the way now mentioned it
    was carefully organized and had when it began operations a reserve fund of about
    l besides receiving subscriptions from tradesunions in most parts of the country
    but the coalowners determined not to give way and made every exertion to bring
    miners and other labourers from scotland wales and ireland to supply the place
    of those who had seceded the result justified the wisdom of their determination
    for the turnouts after an obstinate strike of from four to five months duration
    in which they exhausted every resource and suffered the greatest privations were
    compelled to abandon every one of their pretensions and to beg to be allowed to
    resume their employment under the same regulations as formerly at their old and
    in some cases even at lower wages and this with but few exceptions is the ordinary
    result of the best organized combinations the substitution of machinery for manual
    labour has combinadone more perhaps than anything else to put down comtion binations
    in manufacturing employments and though injurious to the workpeople combinations
    for an improper purpose are sometimes advantageous by the stimulus they give to
    the improvement of machinery in corroboration of this statement it is only necessary
    to refer to the machines for woolcombing mulespinning and others of the same kind
    which were invented and introduced to emancipate the masters from the dictation
    of unions and the unreasonable demands and proceedings of the woolcombers cottonspinners
    c they have been completely successful and have in truth not only rendered these
    employments comparatively independent of combinations but have materially improved
    and cheapened the products of the manufactures into which they have been introduced
    even in the rare cases in which workmen from some peculiar circumstances such
    as their employers having entered into extensive contracts to be completed within
    specified periods have succeeded in obtaining an improper advance of wages it
    has uniformly in the end been injurious to them this result is brought about in
    various waysby the high wages attracting too many labourers to the business by
    the various expenses attendant on a combination which make a heavy deduction from
    the wages of those engaged in it by the demand for the articles being checked
    or lessened by the greater cost of their production and so forth nothing indeed
    but the merest ignorance could make it be supposed that wages could be really
    increased by such proceedings they depend on a principle which they cannot affect
    that is on the proportion between capital and population and cannot be increased
    except by the increase of the former as compared with the latter for these reasons
    we think it is impossible that any one who will calmly consider the subject should
    resist coming to the conclusion that a combination for an improper object or to
    raise wages above their proper level must cure itself or that it must necessarily
    bring its own chastisement along with it in some instances strikes have been entered
    into from hostile feelings against obnoxious masters and not unfrequently the
    workmen are seduced into them by the artful representations of agitators in whom
    they place undeserved confidence and who make them the means of advancing their
    own selfish ends without caring for the misery they may entail on their dupes
    but in the majority of cases a strike can hardly fail under ordinary circumstances
    to be a subject of the most serious concern to workmen who have either forethought
    or experience and the privations to which it unavoidably exposes them form a strong
    presumption that they are honestly impressed with a conviction that the advance
    of wages which they claim is fair and reasonable and that the strike has been
    forced upon them by the improper resistance of the masters even in those cases
    in which wages are notoriously depressed below their proper level workmen will
    if they consult their own interests be shy about striking and will resort to it
    only as a last resource such a proceeding instantly deprives them and those that
    are dependent on their exertions of their accustomed means of subsistence in the
    event of their masters delaying for any considerable period to come to an accommodation
    they are obliged from inability to support themselves to depend for a while on
    the grudging and stinted contributions of others and when this humiliating resource
    is exhausted they must return to the business they have left or else engage in
    employments to which they have not been bred and which are not congenial to their
    habits it is not therefore easy to suppose that workmen when they become acquainted
    with the real effects of combinations will rashly enter into them and proceed
    to a strike for the purpose of obtaining unreasonable or exorbitant

    was nevertheless a careful and efficient instructor as has been gratefully commemorated
    by more than one pupil who afterwards rose to eminence in life stevenson during
    stewarts attendance on his course of lectures showed the greatness of his mind
    by candidly giving up as insufficient and in part erroneous doctrines which he
    had inculcated during the greater portion of a long life when in his later years
    he became convinced on grounds adduced by another of their inadequacyan exemplification
    of the philosophical spirit which gained the admiration and lived in the memory
    of his youthful auditors the preceptor by whom mr stewart was most strongly influenced
    at this period was doubtless adam ferguson the accomplished professor of moral
    philosophy with ferguson stewart had much in common the pupil naturally and cordially
    sympathised with the admiration of classical antiquity the fervid eloquence the
    liberal political doctrines and above all the lofty and ennobling ethical views
    which characterised his instructor dr ferguson moreover very early discovered
    and appreciated the peculiar capacity of his pupil for reflective studies about
    this period mr stewart appears to have entertained the design of studying for
    the church of england the university of glasgow then as at present afforded facilities
    to young men of talent and application for pursuing a course of study at oxford
    stewart accordingly entered that university in  partly with a view to the snell
    exhibition but also influenced hy the recommendation of ferguson that he might
    enjoy the privilege of the prelections of dr thomas reid whose inquiry into the
    human mind  was already regarded by thinking men as the inauguration of a new
    epoch in speculative philosophy reid occupied a chair which had been rendered
    celebrated by his predecessors hutcheson and adam smith its influence and lustre
    were destined even more greatly to increase during reids professoriate while powerfully
    combating the fundamental doctrines of locke berkeley and hume the prelections
    of reid were admirably fitted to evoke and regulate the philosophical capacity
    of his pupils in a style lucid simple and devoid of technicality or much speculative
    refinement he inculcated a philosophy of the nature origin and bounds of human
    knowledge at once independent and restrained and bearing in all its parts strong
    traces of that fresh and vigorous reflection manliness earnestness and lofty aim
    by which he was so eminently characterised stewart caught the spirit of his instructor
    and intelligently appreciated his philosophical method and purpose during a long
    lifetime consecrated to philosophy stewart nourished that spirit in scotland and
    continued and extended the application of the method with a freshness power delicacy
    amplitude of learning and illustration all his ownevincing that he was no mere
    inheritor of a dead tradition but a true disciple in whose mind principles quickened
    and grew until they effloresced in all the fulness and variety of life and beauty
    in  mr stewart at the early age of nineteen undertook the charge of the mathematical
    classes in the university of edinburgh in room of his father whose health was
    beginning to decline these classes he conducted with marked ability and success

    of scotland but many and these of the highest rank from england the continent
    of europe and america likewise furnished a number of pupils the sphere of investigation
    which mr stewart proposed to himself in the chair of moral philosophy was far
    from being limited by the science of ethics proper the groundplan of his course
    was a study of the human mind in the totality of its phenomena or to use more
    recent phraseology the science of general psychology with this as a basis or root
    he connected metaphysics proper or the science of first principles the application
    of these principles in natural theology ethics proper the theory of taste politics
    including the theory of government and political economy as a philosophical lecturer
    stewart must be allowed to have held a high place though the character of his
    mind was not severely analytic or abstract without habitually offering a definite
    determination of the questions which he discussed he had the faculty of unfolding
    comprehensive fields of thought and thus of exciting in a high degree the intellectual
    activity of his students he possessed moreover and wielded wdth the ease of a
    master the power of sketching ideals of human life and action which inspired in
    many of his youthful hearers an enthusiasm at once so intense and continuous as
    to influence and mould their whole future character his mode of lecturing that
    of speaking from notes was well suited to the character of his mind and to his
    treatment of philosophical themes it allowed full scope for the imagination and

    the economists and smith in advocating the propriety of allowing the freest scope
    for individual interest and effort in the matter of trade and the unrestricted
    exchange between nations of the varied products of their industry on this point

    application than their author had allowed  for he maintained against smith the
    impolicy of those restrictions known as the navigation laws which were only finally
    abolished in  to the political teachings of stewart the present generation owes
    more than it can well appreciate at a time when the mere discussion of the fundamental
    principles of politics and political economy was sufficient to excite suspicion
    of disaffectedness to the interests of the country and of sympathy with revolutionary
    tendencies stewart had the courage in his place as a university professor to canvass
    those questions and to seek to inculcate on the intelligent youth of the land
    opinions of so advanced a character that they did not meet with general appreciation
    and acceptance until long after the period of their promulgation in march  mr
    stewart gave to the world the first volume of elements of the philosophy of the
    human mind  his volume was his earliest contribution towards that scheme of a
    comprehensive delineation of the human mind which he had proposed to himself as
    the grand aim of his life the volume is chiefly psychological  and after preliminary
    remarks on the nature ends and utility of philosophy deals with the powers of
    knowledge embracing external perception attention conception the laws of association
    memory and imagination at the period of the publication of the first volume of
    the elements philosophical speculation at least in england was of the lowest sensational
    school the theorists in philosophy of that time sought to explain the mental phenomena

    application of the principle of association nothing accordingly could be more
    opportune than the appearance of the first volume  mr stewarts writings at the
    period in question in spirit and matter the kind of thinking which these writings
    successively exemplified was fitted to impart an elevated tone to the current
    speculation and feeling of the age alike in psychology metaphysics and morals

    on what was known as the leslie case entitled a statement of facts fyc and in
    december of the same year he added a second pamphlet entitled postscript to statement
    of facts the statement of facts though hastily written is remarkable for the clearness
    and ability with which it disentangles the real point at issue from the mass of
    irrelevant matter which as usually happens was raised in the popular discussion
    of a purely philosophical question on general and historical grounds mr stewart
    seeks to vindicate within certain limits the doctrine of causation the approval
    of which by mr leslie was made the ground of objection to his appointment to the
    chair of natural philosophy mr stewart especially endeavours to show that the
    doctrine which teaches that the utmost we can observe in physical sequences is
    simply invariable antecedence and consequence is both theologically innocuous

    in  in the summer of  young mackintosh was sent to school at the town of fortrose  and
    he had scarcely learned to read when he evinced that predilection for abstract
    speculation which afterwards formed so prominent a feature of his intellectual
    character a gentleman having lent him burnets commentary on the thirtynine articles
    he perused it with great avidity and the part which struck him most forcibly and
    which he read with peculiar eagerness and pleasure was the commentary on the seventeenth
    article which relates to predestination a strange subject to engage the attention
    and interest the understanding of a mere boy his mind appears to have revolted
    atthe doctrine of eternal decrees of election and reprobation though surrounded
    by orthodox calvinists he became a warm advocate for free will and before he had
    completed ms fourteenth year he was probably the boldest heretic in the county
    about the same time he read the old translation of plutarchs lives echards roman
    history and the works of pope and swift his first poetical attempt was a pastoral
    or elegy on the death of his uncle brigadiergeneral fraser who fell on the th
    of october  rn anc  n an  his muse was exceedingly prolific and he even commenced
    an epic poem on the defence of cyprus by evagoras king of salamis against the
    persian army in october  he entered kings college aberdeen w ere he remained during
    that and the three following sessions at aberdeen he was by common consent recognised  inter
    studiosos facile princeps whilst his courteous demeanour refined manners playful
    fancy and easy flow of elocution rendered him a general favourite amongst his
    companions his chief associate at kings college was the ate reverend robert hall
    whom the exclusive system of the english universities had forced to seek in this
    northern vol xiii mac seminary for that academical education which was denied
    to him as a dissenter in his own country like castor and pollux these young men
    were assimilated in the minds of all who knew them by reason of the equal splenour
    o their talents although in other respects they were extremely unlike in the spring
    of  having previously taken his degree of master of arts he finally quitted kings
    college  with he says but little regular and exact knowledge but with considerable
    activity of mind and boundless literary ambition  and in the october following
    he set out for edinburgh to commence the study of physic which he had made choice
    of as a profession his arrival in that city opened a new world to his mind edinburgh
    was then the residence of many eminent men  of adam smith dr black john home henry
    mackenzie dr cullen principal robertson dr ferguson dr hutton professor robison
    mr dugald stewart and others he was admitted a member of the speculative society
    which had been established about twenty years before and which had general literature
    and science for its objects in this exciting atmosphere speculation rather than
    study engrossed his attention speculators indeed are seldom submissive learners
    those who will make proficiency in useful knowledge must for a time trust to their
    teachers and believe in their superiority but those who too early think for themselves
    must sometimes imagine themselves wiser than their masters and lienee docility
    is often extinguished when the work of education is scarcely commenced after three
    years spent in edinburgh he obtained the degree of md in  and eaily in   he set
    out for london his views were in the first instance directed to the medical profession  and
    he was led from circumstances to contemplate a medical appointment in russia but
    this project in which he w r as supported by mr dugald stewart did not take effect
    and it is probable that he felt but little regret at the failure of a scheme which
    would have removed him from such a scene of interest and enjoyment as london then
    presented on the th of february  he was privately married to miss catharine stuart
    a young lady of a respectable scotch amily and at the age of twentyfour he found
    himself with no prospect of any immediate professional settlement his little fortune
    rapidly diminishing and a wife to provide for r the struggle regarding the regency
    that followed the announcement of the malady with which the king had been attacked
    in the autumn of  was the occasion of a pamphlet by mr mackintosh in support of
    the analogy which mr fox endeavoured to establish between the actual state of
    his majesty and a natural demise of the crown this seems to have been his first
    public appearance in the field of politics for which his mind had now taken a
    decided turn about the same time he made the acquaintance of horne  ooke whose
    cause he warmly espoused at the election for westminster in the autumn of  he
    made a tour in company with his wife through the low countries to brussels and
    upon his return to london contributed a number of articles on belgium and france
    to the oracle newspaper with which he appears to have been for some time connected
    to the same date must be referred his resolution to devote himself to the study
    of the law hitherto the exercise of his powers had been almost exclusively confined
    to the columns of a newspaper but although the most successful efforts of ability
    are often passed unheeded or make but a feeble and transitory impression where
    such are neither looked for nor expected yet this preliminary training was not
    without its advantage and the time now approached when he was to appear before
    the world in a higher and more independent character u pduced by the publication
    of mr burke s reflections on the french revolution the  g  mackintosh

  text: 'a ri s t o t l e practical involves a difficulty in reconciling the notion
    of justice with philosohis theory of virtue looking at justice as a dispensing
    phypower he observed that it was concerned about  a mean in things themselves
    in apportioning to each person his exact due whether of reward or punishment on
    the ground of this fact he points out that justice is not a mean as the other
    virtues are but is  of the meannot in itself  a relative mean but  relative to
    a mean had he considered justice solely as a moral habit he would have seen that
    the distinction was unnecessary since in this point of view it conforms precisely
    to his general notion of virtue in being a principle of selfmoderation there is
    however a foundation for the remark in the circumstance that justice admits of
    greater exactness in its exercise than other virtues  the rules of justice says
    an excellent writer   may be compared to the rules of grammar the rules of the
    other virtues to the rules which critics lay down for the attainment of what is
    sublime and elegant in composition in the other virtues we are thrown more on
    our sense of propriety in forming our practical decisions in justice we have evident
    facts before usthe merit or demerit of individuals in themselves  and these form
    an external standard to guide us in our conduct over and above our internal convictions
    of right so far then justice may be regarded as of the mean besides being also
    a point of propriety or a mean within ourselves aristotle it should be observed
    had no other more appropriate word distinct from justice to express  honesty or  integrity
    and consequently was led to generalize too far in his analysis of justice aristotles
    discussion of friendship  is open to similar objection he has considered it in
    its outward effects as a social principle akin to justiceto which justice is subordinate
    and supplementaryrather than as an internal ethical principle the moderated exercise
    of benevolence in the heart itself his observations however on the subject admirably
    illustrate the importance of friendship to the right constitution of societythe
    various modifications of the benevolent principle in the different relations of
    human life together with the peculiar amiableness of virtue in itself in the last
    respect indeed the discussion forms an essential part of his moral philosophy
    as it tends to show his conviction that the moral principles have their seat in
    the heart indeed this part of his ethics as well as his inquiry into justice should
    be accurately studied by all who would obtain just views of the comprehensive
    character of the virtue of his system together they comprise a body of relative
    duties under justice would be classed the duties of religion memory of the dead
    filial reverence patriotism civil obedience veracity honesty c  so far as these
    duties flow from claims on our respect and are prescribed by human laws under
    friendship the same duties as they are prompted by sentiment and feeling and are
    known by the names of piety gratitude benevolence fidelity generosity c hence
    the character of virtue in the little compilation on the virtues and vices which
    passes among his works  that  it is of virtue both to benefit the woithy and to
    love the good and to be neither apt to punish nor revengeful but merciful and
    placable and indulgent and thus there follow on virtue kindness equity candour
    good hope  moreover such qualities as to be domestic friendly social hospitable
    philanthropic and a lover of what is honourable  his theory then of virtue must
    be regarded as involving a minute and distinct attention to all the particular
    virtues and herein appears its great excellence as contrasted with philosophy  those
    of some modern philosophers who have endeavoured practical to trace up all the
    virtues to some one principle of our nature philsoas benevolence or selflove or
    prudence all such theories v  are in truth mere accommodations of language by
    which   different classes of phenomena are arranged under the same terms the effect
    of which is to give a shadowiness to the form of virtue instead of striking it
    out in distinct outline aristotles theory is the law by which these different
    principles are held together in factthe common process by which the operation
    of each virtue is carried on  and which when realized in the character of a man
    gives him the command of all the virtues the ancient moral philosophy sought like
    the modern to resolve virtue into some one principle but the endeavour of the
    ancients was chiefly to ground it on some intellectual principle socrates contended
    that the virtues were instances of prudence or knowledge fipovycreis or aoyoi
    or tmorrjjlai aristotle shews the foundation of this misconception in explaining
    in what respect the production of virtue might be regarded as the work of the
    intellect each virtue consisting as he shews in the adjustment of the action to
    all the circumstances of the case the virtue of an action must depend on the practical
    judgment of the individual agent and an agent who is uniformly virtuous must exhibit
    this practical judgment uniformly operating enabling him readily to decide on
    the point in which the virtue of acting lies  this operation of the intellect
    on moral objects he designates as the intellectual virtue of prpctence or wisdom  when
    he speaks of it as  defining or bounding the mean in which virtue consists   he
    implies that asl speculative definition presents to the mind an exact notion of
    the thing defined so the principles supplied by prudence give clear perceptions
    of the moral nature of an action for example suppose a man to have received some
    evidentwrongsome injury done to him without provocation the affection of resentment
    naturally leads him to requite the injustice on his assailant but by what method
    of action he should do so is a matter of question he must know exactly in what
    way his resentment should be shewn in order to act virtuously besides having as
    his general principle the inclination to act virtuously  he must therefore have
    had some experience of human lifesome practical knowledge of the nature of actions
    which have been generally approved as fulfilling the end of this affection an
    experience then of this kind applied to the exercise of all the affections and
    operating invariably on the conduct constitutes the prudence of aristotles system
    it is thus intimately connected with the moral principles as the moral principles
    are with it it is the combined result in the intellectual part of our nature of
    all the virtues of the heart as on the other hand prudence is the diverging of
    the intellect through the various virtues of the heart hence his conclusion that
    it is impossible to be properly goodkvpiws ayaoovwithout prudence  or to be prudent
    without moral virtue  and consequently that all the moral virtues are inseparable
    inasmuch as the possession of all is requisite for the perfecting of prudence  and
    with prudence they all follow in this account of prudence is to be traced the
    principle of moral obligation involved in aristotles theory of virtue he considers
    the moral virtues as those of the inferior part of the soul and therefore as formed
    to obey  whereas the intellectual principles as being purely rational have as
    such an intrinsic authority prudence accordingly being the intellectual virtue

  text: aristotle s philosophy practical check to population is required abortion
    should be produced philosobefore the quickening of the infant no law of morality
    he p h ythinks forbidding it at this period  these are striking instances of the
    infirmity of a philosophy which substitutes an intrinsic agency in nature for
    the counsels of an intelligent divine agent working on nature according to such
    a philosophy everything adverse to the perfection of nature is a stumblingblock
    on the hypothesis of a providence the good and the evil may be contemplated with
    equal assurance that  the best will in the end prevail in the former case human
    reason removes suppresses destroys in the latter it moderates counteracts overrules
    doing nothing with rash violence but gently conspiring with the appointed course
    of things in opening a way for good out of the evil in aristotle the immoralities
    here noticed are moreover at dwect variance with the precepts and spirit of his
    moral philosophy again the same moral complexion characterizes both the public
    and private discipline of the philosopher the honourable to kctw predominates
    over both by this standard every institution whether of bodily or mental exercise
    is to be regulated no illiberal arts such as required manual rather than intellectual
    skill are to be taught not even are the liberal sciences to be pursued excessively
    or with exclusive devotion to any particular ones or with mercenary views  the
    occupation of leisure being the end proposed by the system of education what was
    useful or necessary was to be learned but in subserviency to the honourable  and
    the honourable rather than the useful or necessary  hence the stress laid by aristotle
    on the arts of painting and music it was in the result a general cultivation of
    the mind by literature combined with moral discipline and not the storing it with
    particular sciences which his system of education contemplated he saw that the
    tendency of particular studies was to contract the mental powers to that particular
    range of vision to which they were confined  whereas he sought rather to impart
    a largeness and masculine strength to the understanding commensurate with the
    varied demands of the world in which human life is cast it was what we should
    express by the education of the accomplished gentleman of one who exempt from
    the drudgery of life and having his actions freely at his own disposal might be
    qualified for the highest functions to which nature has destined man in forming
    him a moral and social being for it should be observed that aristotle throughout
    supposes an entire immunity from all servile employments both to the happy man
    and the happy citizen  according to his view a large proportion of mankind are
    physically incapable either of the happiness of moral beings or of that of social
    life persons so imperfectly constituted he conceives to be wholly dependent on
    others and to be by nature relative beings or slaves their proper nature being
    comprised in this relationship of dependence  to this class accordingly he would
    commit all the labours of agriculture of the mechanical arts and the market and
    all menial offices whilst others more gifted by nature enjoy leisure for the proper
    duties of man in the various relations of a moral and social being  the justification
    of the condition of slavery is thus rested by aristotle on abstract grounds he
    viewed it as an institution of nature  differing in this from other philosophers
    and from the popular notion of his own countrymen who either founded it on the
    right of conquest or on an assumed original difference between greek and barbarian
    this was  a far more liberal view of the subject than that which prepractical
    vailed generally in his time for it implied that no one had philsoa right to retain
    another as his slave who was not thus phyv p hy   sically dependent every one
    had a right to be free who was capable of enjoying freedom in the performance
    of the duties for which man in his perfection was constituted this doctrine further
    imposed on the master a strict moral attention to his slave the slave was thrown
    on him not only for support but for direction in his duties  that religion should
    have formed no part of the business of education in his system was further consistent
    with his ethics the moral koaov terminated in the perfect fulfilment of all those
    relations in which man was placed as a being of this world it was heightened by
    the consideration that gods might delight in looking down on such perfection and
    that in its highest state it resembled the excellence of divinity but it did not
    strike its roots into or draw its nourishment from religion nor did the kokov
    of social life the accomplished citizen might be taught to contemplate himself
    in the thoughtful activity of a philosophical leisure as holding a dignified station
    among men analogous to the divine principles which maintain the order of the universe  but
    there was no connection between his social virtues and his religious system the
    religious colouring was only the borrowed light of philosophy all active religion
    was consigned to the instrumentality of a particular body of menthe priests the
    obligatory force of religion was recognised but being lodged in an external establishment
    as its depository and sanctuary reverence was sought for it by outward bonds of
    respect by the privileges of the order to whose care it was intrusted and the
    splendour of its public spectacles aristotle accordingly treats the subject merely
    as one of policy he observes that no one of the rank of a mechanic or peasant
    should be appointed a priest since it was necessary that the gods should be honoured
    by the citizens and he points out the importance of the religious character to
    the absolute sovereign of a state in order to the obedience of the subject  aristotles
    account of his theoretic polity leaves off abruptly at the end of the th book
    and the treatise is thus as now extant an imperfect development of his views but
    the theory of the perfect polity is only a part of the very valuable materials
    of the politics the work embraces a wide survey of the social nature of man throughout
    indeed it may be studied as elements of the philosophy of history it lays open
    the principles of preservation and decay inherent in the different constitutions
    and points out the common principles on which the maintenance of civil order under
    any form whatever must essentially depend nor has the study which now obtains
    the name of political economy been overlooked by aristotle the nature of money
    and of the wealth to which it has given rise particularly attracted his attention
    it may suffice to shew how accurately he thought on the subject to observe that
    his account of the origin of moneytracing it to its service as a common measure
    of value in exchanges and as a conventional substitute for a demand for commoditieshas
    been adopted by the author of the celebrated work the wealth of nations on the
    whole justly to appreciate the labours of aristotle in political science we should
    compare them with the elaborate and eloquent works of plato on the same subject

    of the observatory of dorpat the foundationstone of the observatory of pulkowa
    was laid in   and in the autumn of  this best endowed and most perfectly organized
    of all european observatories was completed and in working order we must be content
    to give only a few details concerning this admirable institution the instruments
    are the following   a large transit instrument by ertel with provision for reversing
    the position of the eyepiece and objectglass and with a collimating mark placed
    on a pier to the s of the instrument  a large vertical circle by ertel in construction
    similar to an astronomical theodolite the focal length of the telescope is  inches
    and the diameter of the objectglass very nearly  inches with this instrument were

    printed in the transactions of the petersburg academy  a meridian circle by repsold
    with all the improvements suggested by m struves experience the focal length of
    the telescope is nearly  feet and the aperture of the objectglass  inches  this
    instrument is designed says m struve   for the collection of a great mass of observations
    to serve for the construction of a vast catalogue of stars  a large transit instrument
    by repsold placed in the prime vertical the telescope is of feet focal length
    and j inches aperture of objectglass with this i instrument m struve made his
    observations for determining the value of the constant of the aberration of light

    great refracting telescope by merz and mahler of which the focal length is  feet
    and the clear aperture of the objectglass  inches it is mounted equatorially according
    to the usual method applied to foreign telescopes it has been used with great
    effect by m otto struve son of the director on the system of saturn and on other
    objects a similar telescope has since been erected at the observatory of harvard
    college cambridge massachusetts which has added to astronomical discovery  a heliometer
    by merz and mahler of which the focal length is  feet and the aperture of the
    objectglass is i inches these are the grand instruments of the establishment which
    is also liberally supplied with smaller instruments of every kind there is also
    a very fine library attached to the establishment of which the foundation is that
    of gibers purchased after his decease connected with the observatory are workshops
    for making the requisite repairs and alterations in the instruments and to these
    are attached mechanists and carpenters superintended by proper officers besides
    the persons on the ordinary staff of the establishment several others are ordinarily
    attached either for instruction or for the carrying on of special works or in
    connexion with geodeticai or geographical operations to give some idea of the
    extent of this noble institution m struve estimated that in  there were no fewer
    than  persons including the wives and families of the persons employed residing
    within its boundaries we are obliged to conclude this short account of a few of
    the leading observatories of europe without mention of many n  m y others of very
    considerable importance in the history of ashistory tronomy we should have been
    glad to have given some dev v j tailed notices of that of bonn including the labours

    posterity is to reap the principal or entire advantage  and which also gives its
    fullest extension to private and public enterprise and credit that accumulation
    of capital which has taken place in england during the last hundred years and
    which besides enabling us to defray with little difficulty the cost of so many
    protracted and destructive wars has covered the land with cities and all sorts
    of improvements and the ocean with ships would either not have taken place at
    all or but in a very subordinate degree had there been any serious doubt about
    its present or future security or about the ability of the owner to employ it
    or bequeath it at pleasure the various circumstances that will be immediately
    mentioned give us peculiar means and advantages for the production of wealth but
    the consciousness of security is required to make these circumstances be turned
    to the best account and the produce of industry largely saved and accumulated
    and the more intense this consciousness becomes the greater cceteris paribus will
    be the progress of the society in arts and industry freedom of i he absence of
    monopolies and the freedom to engage industry in industrious undertakings conduce
    in no ordinary degree to the advancement of the arts every man is always exerting
    himself to find out how he may best extend his command over necessaries and conveniences
    and sound policy requires that so long as he does not interfere with the rights
    and privileges of others he should be allowed to pursue his own interest in his
    own way though human reason is limited and fallible and we are often swayed by
    prejudices and deceived by appearances still it is sufficiently certain that the

    and privileges of all but it is not possible for them to go one step further without
    receding from the principle of noninterference and laying themselves open to the
    charge of acting partially by some and unjustly by others the most comprehensive
    experience confirms the truth of these leinrks the natural order of things has
    been less interfered with in great britain than in most other manufaccountries
    since the passing of the act of james i in  tures for the abolition of monopolies
    full scope has been given to the competition of the home producers  and though
    the various resources of talent and genius have neither been so fully nor so early
    developed as they would have been had there been no restrictions on our intercourse
    with foreigners they have been developed in a degree unknown to most other countries
    france previously to the revolution was divided into provinces having each peculiar
    privileges and separate codes of revenue laws and this also was the case with
    germany spain and italy so that they were not only deprived of the freedom of
    foreign but even of internal commerce the inhabitants of each province being in
    great measure isolated from the rest there was comparatively little competition  and
    instead of invention and active exertion there was nothing but routine and indifference
    holland and the united states have been the only countries that have enjoyed the
    same degree of internal freedom as great britain and the former notwithstanding
    the unfavourable physical circumstances under which she is placed has long been
    and still is the richest country of europe while the latter whose condition is
    in other respects more favourable is advancing with giant steps in the career
    of improvement but the freedom of the home trade or the stimulus given to invention
    by the competition of the different parties within the same country how advantageous
    soever is always very inferior to the stimulus given by an unrestricted foreign
    trade a nation which admits either freely or under moderate duties the various
    productions of others adopts that line of policy which is sure to bring her energies
    into the fullest activity she profits by whatever inventions and discoveries may
    be made in countries the most remote as well as among her nearest neighbours  at
    the same time that her manufacturers have not only to contend with each other
    but with those of every other people in a system of this sort no branch or department
    of industry can be artificially bolstered up each must depend upon its own resources
    and if during a restricted trade a business were introduced into a country which
    had no peculiar aptitude for carrying it on it would most likely be extinguished
    when trade was made free but this extinction instead of being a loss to such country
    is a gain the capital and labour which were engaged in an unprofitable business
    will henceforth be diverted to those pursuits which the inhabitants can carry
    on with more advantage and their wealth and that of the community of nations will
    be increased by the better distribution of their labour it would be useless to
    enter even if our limits permitted division of into any lengthened details in
    regard to the advantages reem p lo y suiting to society from the division of labour
    that is from ments the execution of certain tasks or duties being committed to
    particular persons possessing the age strength skill and other qualifications
    required for their proper performance these have been set in a clear light by
    adam smith and others and are familiar to everybody but it is not perhaps so generally
    known that the division of labour is in a great degree dependent on the extent
    of the market and that it becomes more perfect and complete according as the latter
    is more and more extended there are many employments that cannot be carried on
    in thinly peopled countries and of those that are or may be carried on in them
    or in others there is hardly one which may not be improved and perfected by increasing
    the demand for the peculiar services or articles which it furnishes to be satisfied
    of the truth of this statement we have only to look around us take the case of
    the cotton the woollen or the iron manufacture these great departments of industry
    could not have attained to such vast magnitude or been furnished with the complex

  text: mediterranean sea mediterranean sea ranean and the atlantic respectively has
    been determined by m bouillon la grange after a series of experiments to be  to  the
    phosphorescent brilliance of this sea is now known to be produced by noctilucous
    animalcula but it is not peculiar to the mediterranean the prevailing colour of
    the water is a deep blue  but in the adriatic it is of a greenish hue and towards
    the e it approaches purple  iii the mediterranean receives many large rivers both
    trom europe and africa of which the most considerable are the ebro rhone po and
    nile and in addition to the rivers by which it is fed it derives a considerable
    supply of water from the strong current which always sets in from the black sea
    and the sea of marmora through the dardanelles and also from the current which
    sets in from the atlantic through the straits of gibraltar but as its level continues
    unchanged it would seem that the water entering it is not more than sufficient
    to supply the waste occasioned by evaporation some indeed have supposed that there
    is an undercurrent setting outward through the straits of gibraltar  but this
    opinion does not seem to rest on solid and trustworthy evidence a calculation
    made by halley ot the quantity of water removed by evaporation showed it to be
    sufficiently great to preserve the level but according to smyth the grounds for
    this theory are insufficient and incorrect but however it may be accounted for
    there can be no doubt of the fact that the system of compensation is accurately
    adjusted between the water coming in and going out the principal current of the
    mediterranean flows to the e from the atlantic along the african coast till it
    reaches the coast of syria and asia minor when it returns westward along the northern
    shores of the sea in the middle of the mediterranean between sicily and africa
    the currents are very irregular varying according to the changes of the wind and
    weather in the adriatic the current runs up the dalmatian and down the italian
    shore with considerable steadiness in the archipelago the prevailing direction
    is from the ne caused by the water of the  pontic sea  whose icy current and compulsive
    course neer feels retiring ebb but keeps due on to the propontis and the hellespont
    the mediterranean is subject to tides though these are very inconsiderable in
    comparison with other seas and very irregular in their motions  his fact however
    cannot be taken as any objection against the true theory of tides discovered by
    newton the weakness of those in this sea being a necessary consequence of its
    comparatively small extent and of the narrowness and position of its communication
    with the ocean which render it impossible for the level at any part to be considerably
    raised by the influx of water through a passage which is narrow and in a direction
    opposite to the course of the great tidal wave of the world the prevailing winds
    in the mediterranean are those which blow from n and w but in the spring months
    se and sw breezes are most frequent among the most remarkable winds in this sea
    is the mistral a cold wind which comes from the snows of the alps and rushes southward
    over provence and the valley of the rhone to the sea blowing with great violence
    and impetuosity and forming one of the scourges of provence of a very different
    character is the muchdreaded scirocco a hot wind blowing from the se over the
    sultry deserts of africa this blast is felt on the s coast of sicily  but having
    passed over a large extent of water it is not so oppressive there as when it has
    again become heated by traversing the island and it is especially felt at palermo
    on the n coast another wind very dangerous to ships is the bora  which like the
    ancient boreas whence it derives its name is a n or ne breeze it is frequently
    accompanied with thunder lightning and rain and sometimes lasts as long as three
    days though its usual duration is fifteen or twenty hours waterspouts are of frequent
    occurrence in the mediterranean and are much dreaded or at least carefully avoided
    by cautious navigators they are believed to be the result of the rotatory motion
    produced in the atmosphere by whirlwinds with the addition of the electricity
    of the air electrical phenomena are common in this sea and one of the most remarkable
    and famous of these appearances consists of the balls of fire which play round
    the masts and rigging of ships called by the ancients castor and pollux and by
    the modern seamen of the mediterranean corpo santo or st elmos fire these meteors
    are harmless but when only a single ball appears it is believed to be a bad omen

  text: partnership formation and constitution of jointstock companies partnership
    we therefore are disposed entirely to approve of the principle of the bill introduced
    into parliament during the session of  by lord goderich for the compulsory registration
    of the partners in partnerships the clamour that was raised against it was most
    unreasonable it could make no improper disclosures for if a man be ashamed of
    being in a partnership the sooner he leaves it the better it will be for himself
    and all concerned neither did it interfere in any manner of way with the freedom
    of industry or of association or lay any restriction on one thing or another its
    sole object was to let in light on a few dark places  to show who messrs a b  co
    really were it eliminated fictitious names and disclosed real and sleeping partners  but
    it did nothing more it made no suggestions and gave no directions and we have
    yet to learn that any wrong could be done to any honest man by its disclosures
    while the benefits of which they would be productive are many and obvious we have
    no doubt that some measure having the same objects in view will be eventually
    carried it is difficult to suppose that it should be objected to except by those
    who desire to be in the dark because it affords greater facilities for the carrying
    out of sinister projects when the joint debts of a firm are paid and the property
    duly distributed among the partners the dissolution may be said in a general sense
    to be accomplished if any one of the firm be guilty of a breach of duty in misapplying
    the effects before the concern is finally wound up the proper course is to apply
    to the court of chancery to appoint a manager within a reasonable time after the
    death of a partner the survivor or survivors must account to the representatives
    of the deceased  and if not willing to do so a court of equity will compel him
    or them in taking partnership accounts at the death of a partner they must commence
    with the laststated account or if there be none such with the commencement of
    the partnership  and they must end with the state of the stock at the time of
    the partners death and the proceeds thereof until it be got in no notice is necessary
    to third parties of the death of a partner the partnership is dissolved and all
    liabilities for subsequent acts cease the surviving parties are to be sued alone
    for the partnership liabilities and obligations for which they are liable to the
    full extent but they are not liable for the separate debts of the deceased partner
    unless after payment of the joint debts they have a surplus of partnership effects
    in their hands upon a dissolution by death if the joint effects be insufficient
    to pay the partnership debts the separate estate of the deceased partner if he
    have any is liable for the deficiency the statements now made may probably be
    sufficient to give our readers a tolerably distinct notion ol the formation of
    partnerships and of the more important rights duties liabilities c arising out
    of such institutions those who wish to go deeper into the subject may consult

    ii companiesby a company in commerce and the arts is meant a copartnery or association
    of sundry in great britain at least seven persons united together for the prosecution
    or carrying on of some lawful business or pursuit the capital or joint stock of
    a company is greater or less according to circumstances but whatever may be its
    amount it is uniformly raised by the issue of such a number of shares of such
    magnitude as those interested may think expedient the individuals enrolled in
    the books of the company as the holders of these shares being its partners owing
    however to the latter being in most instances very numerous living at considerable
    distances from each other partnerand being commonly engaged in other pursuits
    it is imshi ppracticable for them personally to conduct the companys affairs these
    are in consequence entrusted to the management of a board of directors elected
    by and responsible to the shareholders the latter in fact can do nothing individually
    all their resolutions are taken in common and are carried into effect by the directors
    they have chosen and their officers in a private copartnery says adam smith  no
    partner without the consent of the company can transfer his share to another person
    or introduce a new member into the company each member however may upon proper
    warning withdraw from the copartnery and demand payment from them of his share
    of the common stock in a jointstock company on the contrary no member can demand
    payment of his share from the company but each member may without their consent
    transfer his share to another person and thereby introduce a new member the value
    of a share in a jointstock is always the price which it will bring in the market
    and this may be either greater or less in any proportion than the sum which its
    owner stands credited for in the stock of the company wealth of nations p  according
    to the common law of england all the partunlimited ners in jointstock companies
    without regard to the magniliability of i tude of the shares held by them are
    jointly and individupartners at ally liable to the whole extent of their fortunes
    for the j mon debts of the companies they may make arrangements among themselves
    limiting their liabilities with respect to each other but unless established by
    authority competent to set aside the general rule the partners are all indefinitely
    liable to the public in some instances however parliament interfered to limit
    the responsibility of the shareholders in jointstock companies to the amount of
    their shares and the act th geo iv c  empowered the crown to grant charters of
    association to companies the partners of which might be made liable to such an
    extent and subjected to such regulations as might be deemed expedient and hence
    charters were sometimes granted for the purpose merely of enabling companies to
    sue and be sued in the courts of law in the names of their officebearers without
    in anywise limiting or affecting the liability of the shareholders to the public
    such limitation was not to be implied by the grant of a charter and was not held
    to exist unless it were distinctly set forth it is much to be regretted that the
    liability of the sharelimited holders has been still farther interfered with and
    that in this respect a very serious inroad has been made on the old law of the
    country the act of  the th and ral jy intr  th viet c  authorizes the establishment
    of comducedin panics for the carrying on of most descriptions of businesses  banking
    and insurance were excepted the liability of the partners in which may be limited
    to the amount of their shares and hence it results that in all cases in which
    these have been fully paid up the partners are relieved of all responsibility
    and are no longer liable for anything though the bankruptcy of the companies to
    which they belong may occasion the ruin of thousands they cannot be called upon
    to contribute a single farthing to the relief of distresses that have most probably
    been caused by their misconduct well might the highest authority who can be appealed
    to on such subjects charge this system with injustice  for as he observes  in
    the case of the insolvency of a concern it removes a portion of the loss which
    must be borne by some party from those who have voluntarily engaged in the concern
    who have had the means of watching and controlling its progress and who would
    have been the sole participators in the benefits of its success for

    ship means of insight into the state of the concern no power over its management
    and no share in its advantages the commandite partners may have embarked a very
    small share of their property in the concern and must therefore be very slightly
    injured by its failure whilst those to whom it is indebted may be very seriously
    injured even to the extent of ruin  defective besides being vicious in principle

    right to make roads or canals to take up streets that gas or water pipes may be

    in cases of this sort the acts referred to are sufficient and all partnerships
    or companies for ordinary industrial purposes if they consist of more than twenty
    partners must be established or registered under these acts and made conformable
    to them while if they consist of seven and under twenty partners they may be so
    established or registered and in either case the liability of the partners may
    be limited to the amount of their shares or be made or kept indefinite as they
    may judge best in like manner banking companies with more than ten partners must
    and those with seven and under ten may be established and must be registered under
    the act th and st viet c   but as already stated the liability of the partners
    in such companies was not limited by the acts referred to in addition to the clauses
    in the acts now mentioned as regulating the constitution of new and modifying
    that of old companies there are others which relate to their voluntary and compulsory
    windingup their bankruptcy c and whether it were intended by parliament or not
    the effect of these statutes has been materially to modify the former indefinite
    liability of the partners in ordinary jointstock companies these associations
    have been by a sort of legislative hocuspocus metamorphosed into incorporations  so
    that their funds only are liable to be taken in execution by their creditors the
    rights of the latter have in truth been sacrificed without compensation or equivalent
    of any sort  a creditor cannot now as he could have done three years ago pounce
    upon any shareholder he pleased and pursue him tor payment of his debt leaving
    to the shareholder to seek an indemnity from his copartners when the funds of
    a company supposing the liability of the partners to be unlimited are insufficient
    to make good its engagements a petition is presented to the court of chancery
    praying to have the company wound up on this being done the creditors can take
    no farther steps in the matter but must wait the result the court may order calls
    to be made sufficient to pay the debts due by the company but this is always a
    very slow process and if the creditors get paid in the end which may be doubtful
    it can only be after they have been kept out of their money for lengthened periods
    most probably for a considerable number of years  we do not suppose that regulations
    having such consequences are likely to be permanent their nature and influence
    were not declared and were indeed very imperfectly known and that only to a few
    members when they were before parliament but the longer they are maintained the
    more mischievous will they be found to be it is not going partnertoo far to say
    that the present state of the law in regard ship to the constitution windingup
    and bankruptcy of jointstock companies is more than discreditable that it is disgraceful
    to the country had its object been to introduce fraud and recklessness into their
    constitution and management and delay and expense into the legal proceedings to
    which they may give rise it is doubtful whether it could have been materially
    improved but supposing that jointstock companies are properly undertakorganized
    that the liability of the partners is unlimited ln g s which and that creditors
    have every facility given them for getting ma y  su  payment of their debts still
    there are only certain varieties carried of undertakings to which they can be
    advantageously apby jointplied to insure a reasonable prospect of success to a
    comstock company the undertaking should admit of its being carried on panics according
    to a regular systematic plan the reason of this is sufficiently obvious the business
    of a great association must be conducted by factors or agents  and unless it be
    of such a nature as to admit of their duties being clearly pointed out and defined
    the association would cease to have any effectual control over them and would
    be in great measure at their mercy and however conscientious and anxious to do
    their duty they want the powerful motives to act vigorously prudently and economically
    by which private individuals engaged in business are actuated  like says adam
    smith  the stewards of a rich man they are apt to consider attention to small
    matters as not for their masters honour and very easily give themselves a dispensation
    from having it negligence and profusion therefore must always prevail more or
    less in the management of the affairs of such companies it also not unfrequently
    happens that they suffer from the bad faith as well as the carelessness and extravagance
    of their servants the latter having in many instances endeavoured to advance their
    own interests at the expense of their employers hence the different success of
    companies whose business may be conducted according to a nearly uniform system
    and those whose business does not admit of being reduced to any regular plan and
    where much must always be left to the sagacity and enterprise of those employed
    all purely commercial companies trading upon a joint stock belong to the latter
    class not one of them has ever been able to withstand the competition of private
    adventurers they cannot subject the agents they employ to buy and sell commodities
    to any effectual responsibility  and from t is circumstance and the abuses that
    usually insinuate t emselves into every department of their management no such
    company has ever succeeded unless when it has obtained some exclusive privilege
    or been protected trom competition    v and even with these advantages such is
    the negligence profusion and peculation inseparable from the management of great
    commercial companies that those that have had the monopoly of the most advantageous
    branches of commerce have rarely been able to keep out of debt l o buy in one
    market to sell with profit in another to watch over the perpetually occurring
    variations in the prices and m the supply and demand of commodities to suit with
    dexterity and judgment the quantity and quality of goods to the wants of each
    market and to conduct each operation in the best and cheapest manner requires
    a degree of unremitting vigilance and attention which it would be visionary to
    expect from the directors or servants of a jointstock association hence it has

    life the office of warden of the cinque ports with near four thousand a year more
    he had neither wife nor child  he had no needy relations he had no expensive tastes
    he had no long election bills had he given but a quarter of an hour a week to
    the regulation of his household he would have kept his expenditure within bounds
    or if he could not spare even a quarter of an hour a week for that purpose he
    had numerous friends excellent men of business who would have been proud to act
    as his stewards one of those friends the chief of a great commercial house in
    the pit city made an attempt to put the establishment in downing pittenstreet
    to rights  but in vain he found that the waste of weem the servants hall was almost
    fabulous the quantity of v butchers meat charged in the bills was nine hundredweight
    a week the consumption of poultry of fish of tea was in proportion the character
    of pitt would have stood higher if with the disinterestedness of pericles and
    of de witt he had united their dignified frugality the memory of pitt has been
    assailed times innumerable often justly often unjustly but it has suffered much
    less from his assailants than from his eulogists for during many years his name
    was the rallying cry of a class of men with whom at one of those terrible conjunctures
    which confound all ordinary distinctions he was accidentally and temporarily connected
    but to whom on almost all great questions of principle he was diametrically opposed
    the haters of parliamentary reform called themselves pittites not choosing to
    remember that pitt made three motions for parliamentary reform and that though
    he thought that such a reform could not safely be made while the passions excited
    by the french revolution were raging he never uttered a word indicating that he
    should not be prepared at a more convenient season to bring the question forward
    a fourth time the toast of protestant ascendency was drunk on pitts birthday by
    a set of pittites who could not but be aware that pitt had resigned his office
    because he could not carry catholic emancipation the defenders of the test act
    called themselves pittites though they could not be ignorant that pitt had laid
    before george the third unanswerable reasons for abolishing the test act the enemies
    of free trade called themselves pittites though pitt was far more deeoly imbued
    with the doctrines of adam smith than either fox or grey the very negrodrivers
    invoked the name of pitt whose eloquence was never more conspicuously displayed
    than when he spoke of the wrongs of the negro this mythical pitt who resembles
    the genuine pitt as little as the charlemagne of ariosto resembles the charlemagne
    of eginhard has had his day history will vindicate the real man from calumny disguised
    under the semblance of adulation and will exhibit him as what he was a minister
    of great talents honest intentions and liberal opinions preeminently qualified
    intellectually and morally for the part of a parliamentary leader and capable
    of administering with prudence and moderation the government of a prosperous and
    tranquil country but unequal to surprising and terrible emergencies and liable
    in such emergencies to err grievously both on the side of weakness and on the
    side of violence t b m pittacus one of  the seven wise men of greece was born
    at mitylene in lesbos bc  his fathers name was hyrrhadius or caicus with the assistance
    of the sons of alcaeus he delivered his country from the oppression of the tyrant
    melanchrus and in the war which the athenians waged against lesbos he appeared
    at the head of his countrymen and challenged to single combat phrynon the enemys
    general as the event of the war seemed to depend upon this combat pittacus had
    recourse to artifice and when engaged entangled his adversary in a net which he
    had concealed under his shield and easily despatched him he was amply rewarded
    for this victory and his countrymen sensible of his merit unanimously appointed
    him governor of their city with unlimited authority in this capacity pittacus
    behaved with the greatest moderation and prudence  and after he had governed his
    fellowcitizens with the strictest justice and enforced the most salutary laws
    he voluntarily resigned the sovereign power after having enjoyed it for ten years
    observing that the virtues and innocence of private life were incompatible with
    the power and influence of a sovereign his disinterestedness gained him many admirers
    and when the mitylenians wished to reward his public services by presenting him
    with an immense tract of territory he refused to accept more land than could be
    contained within the space to which a javelin could be thrown he died in the seventieth
    year of his age about  bc after he had spent the last ten years of his life in
    literary ease and peaceful retirement numerous anecdotes of his clemency wisdom
    and contempt of wealth are related by diogenes laertius plutarch elian and other
    writers the former mentions various communications between him and croesus and
    preserves a short letter said to have been written by pittacus declining an invitation
    to sardis pittacus composed according to diogenes  elegiac verses of which only
