    ACRIDOPHAGI:
    - "signifies locujl-eaters. It has been much disputed whether the inhabitants\
      \ of Arabia, Ethiopia, <bc ever eat locusts. We Ihall give the substance of\
      \ what Haffelquill says on this fubjedt, who travelled in Syria and Egypt so\
      \ late as the year 1752. This ingenious gentleman, who travelled with a view\
      \ to improve natural history, informs us, that he asked Franks, and many other\
      \ people who had lived long in these countries, whether they had ever heard\
      \ that the inhabitants of Arabia and Ethiopia, &c. used locusts as food. They\
      \ answered that they had. He likewise alked the same question of Armenians,\
      \ Cophtes, and Syrians, who lived in Arabia, and had travelled in Syria and\
      \ near the Red-sea; some of whom said they heard of such a pradtice, and others\
      \ that they, had often seen the people eat these infedts. He at last obtained\
      \ complete fatisfadtion on this head from a learned Iheck at Cairo, who had\
      \ lived six years in Mecca. This gentleman told him, in presence of M. le Grand,\
      \ the principal French interpreter at Cairo, and others, that a famine frequently\
      \ rages at Mecca when there is a scarcity of corn in Egypt, which obliges the\
      \ inhabitants to live upon coarser food than ordinary : That when corn is scarce,\
      \ the Arabians grind the loculls in hand-mills, or Hone mortars, and bake them\
      \ into cakes, and use these cakes in place of bread: That he has frequently\
      \ seen locusts used by the Arabians, even when there was no scarcity of corn;\
      \ but then they boil them, itew them with butter, and make them into a kind\
      \ of fricaffee, which he says is not disagreeably tailed; for he had sometimes\
      \ tailed these locuft-fricaffees out of curiosity. From this account, we may\
      \ see the folly of that dispute among divines about the nature of St John\u2019\
      s food in the wilderness. Some of them say that loculls were the fruits of certain\
      \ trees, others that they were a kind of birds, <bc.; but those who adhered\
      \ to the literal meaning of the text were at leall the moll orthodox, although\
      \ their arguments were perhaps not so Ilrong as they might have been, had they\
      \ had an opportunity of quoting such an author as Haffelquilt. ."

    PAR Of Vegetation:
    - 'and the r | ^ HE vegetation and ceconomy of plants is one of those fubje&s
      in which our knowledge is extremely circumscribed. Many hypotheses have been
      invented ; as many have been, or may easily be, refuted. Hypotheses in matters
      that evidently exceed our powers do much hurt: But they are likewise of some
      ufc. They incite to further inquiries ; and these inquiries are carried on with
      greater spirit, because they are intended for the purpose of confuting. It is
      true this spirit is not the most friendly to impartial observation ; but it
      makes us more indefatigable in our researches. Retailing theories is no part
      of our plan. A total inattention to the ftru<fture and ceconomy of plants is
      the chief reason of the small progress that has been made in rhe principles
      of vegetation, and of the instability and iiuftuation of our theories concerning
      it. To recall the. attend on of philosophers and cultivators, to the only source
      from which any solid theory can ever be formed on this subject, we shall give
      a short deferipbeen made in this art, must be useful both to the farmer and
      philosopher. To accomplifti this end with the greater perspicuity, the fubjeft
      shall be divided into two parts. Under the first. Vegetation, and the Smnfture

      with regard to the principles of vegetation, our particular deferiptions shall
      be limited to one feed, viz. the great garden-bean. Neither is the choice of
      this feed altogether arbitrary; for, after it begins to vegetate, its parts
      are more conspicuous than many others, and consequently better calculated for
      investigation. Tlfis feed is covered with two coats or membranes. The'

    AGRICULTURE: "The outer coat is extremely thin, and full of pores ; but may be\
      \ easily separated from the inner one, (which is much thicker), after the bean\
      \ has been boiled, or lain \u2022 a few days in the soil. At the thick end of\
      \ the bean, there is a small hole vilible to the naked eye, immediately over\
      \ the radicle or future root, that it may have a free passage into the soil.\
      \ Plate IV. fig. i. A. When these coats are taken off, the body of the feed\
      \ appears, which is divided into two smooth portions or lobes. The smoothness\
      \ of tire lobes is owing to a thin' film or cuticle with which they are covered.\
      \ At the bafrs of the bean is placed the radicle or future root, Plate IV. fig.\
      \ 3. A. The trunk of the radicle, just as it enters into the body of the feed,\
      \ divides into two capital branches, one of which is inferred into each lobe,\
      \ and sends off smaller ones in all direftions through the whole substance of\
      \ the lobes, Plate IV. fig. 7. A A. These ramifications become so extremely\
      \ minute towards the edges of the lobes, that they require the finest glasses\
      \ to render them visible. To these ramifications Grew and Malpighius have given\
      \ the name of feminal root; because, by means of it, the radicle and plume,\
      \ before they are expanded, derive their principal nouriftiment. The plume,\
      \ bud, or germ, Plate IV. fig. 3. is inclofed in two small corresponding cavities\
      \ in each lobe. Its colour and consistence is much the same with those of the\
      \ radicle, of which it is only a continuation; but having a quite contrary direction:\
      \ For the radicle descends into the earth, and divides. into a great number\
      \ of smaller branches or filaments ; but the plume alcends into the open air,\
      \ and unfolds itself into all the beautiful variety of stem, branches, leaves,\
      \ flowers, fruit, 6'c. The plume in com ftioots from the smaller end of the\
      \ grain, and, among maltfters, goes by the name of acrofpire. The next thing\
      \ to be taken notice of is the substance, or parenchymatous part of the lobes.\
      \ This is not a mere concreted juice, but is curiously organifed, and consists\
      \ of a vast number of small bladders resembling those in the pith of trees,\
      \ Plate IV. fig. 4. Besides the coats, cuticle, and parenchymatous parts, there\
      \ is a substance perfectly diftihft from these, distributed in different proportions\
      \ through the radicle, plume, and lobes. This inner substance appears very plainly\
      \ in a transverse feftion of the radicle or plume. Towards the extremity of\
      \ the radicle, it is one entire trunk ; but higher up, it divides into three\
      \ branches.; the middle one runs direcftly up to the plume, and the other two\
      \ pass into the lobes on each side, .and spread out into a great variety of\
      \ small branches through the whole body of the lobes, .Plate IV. fig. 7. This\
      \ substance is very properly termed the feminal root: for when the feed is sown,\
      \ the moisture is first absorbed by the outer coats, which are every where furniflied\
      \ with sap and air-vessels; from these it is conveyed to the cuticle; \u2019\
      \ from the cuticle it proceeds to the pulpy part of the lobes ; when it has\
      \ got thus far, it is taken up by the mouths of the small branches of the feminal\
      \ root, and passes from one branch into another, till it is all collefteft into\
      \ the main trunk, which communicates both with the plume and radicle, the two\
      \ principal involved organs of the future plant. After this the sap, or vegetable\
      \ food, runs in two oppoVol.I. No. 2 . L T U R E. , 41 site diredtions ; part\
      \ of it ascends into the plume, and promotes the growth and expansion of that\
      \ organ ; and part of it Jefcends into the radicle, for nourishing and evolving\
      \ the root and its various filaments. Thus the plume and radicle continue their\
      \ progress in opposite directions, till the plant arrives at maturity. It is\
      \ here worth remarking, that every plant is really pofleffed of two roots, both\
      \ of which are contained in the feed. The plume and radicle, when the feed is\
      \ first deposited in the earth, derive their nouriftiment from the feminal root:\
      \ but, afterwards, when the radicle begins to ftioot out its filaments, and\
      \ to absorb some moisture, not, however, in a sufficient quantity to supply\
      \ the exigencies of the plume, the two lobes, or main body of the feed, rise\
      \ along with the plume, aflume the appearance of two leaves, resembling the\
      \ lobes of the leed in size and ftiape, but having no resemblance to those of\
      \ the plume, for which reason they have got the name of dijjimilar leave' s.\
      \ These, diflimilar leaves defend the young plume from the injuries of the weather,\
      \ and at the same time, by absorbing dew, air, <bc. aflift the tender radicle\
      \ in nouriftiing the plume, with which they have still a connection by means\
      \ of the feminal root above described. But, when the radicle or second root\
      \ has descended deep enough into the earth, and has acquired a sufficient number\
      \ of filaments or branches for absorbing as much aliment as is proper for the\
      \ growth of the plume; then the feminal, or diflimilar leaves, their utility\
      \ being entirely superseded, begin to decay and fall off. Plate IV. Fig. j.\

    - " AGRICUS e c t. II. Of the Root. In examining the root of plants, the first\
      \ thing that presents itself is the flcin, which is of various colours in different\
      \ plants. Every root, after it has arrived at a. certain age, has a double Ikin.\
      \ The sir st is coeval with the other parts, and exists in the feed: but afterwards\
      \ there is a ring sent off from the bark, and forms a second'lkin; e g. in the\
      \ root of the dandelion, towards the end of May, the original or outer (kin\
      \ appears thriveted, and is easily separated from the new one, which is fresher,\
      \ and adheres more firmly to the bark. Perennial plants are supplied in this\
      \ manner with a new skin every year; the outer one always falls off in the autumn\
      \ or winter, and a new one is formed from the bark in the fucceedteg spring.\
      \ The Ikin has numerous cells or vessels, and is a continuation of. the parenchymatous\
      \ part of the radicle. However, it does not consist folcly of parenchyma; for\
      \ the microfc Ope shews that there are many tubular lignous vessels interspersed\
      \ through it. When the fkm is removed, the true cortical substance or bark appears,\
      \ which is also a continuation of the parenchymatous part of the radicle, but\
      \ greatly augmented. The bark is of very different sizes. In molt trees, it\
      \ is exceeding thin in proportion to the wood and pith. On the other hand,\"\
      In carrots, it is almost one half of the femidiameter of the root; and, in dandelion,\
      \ it is nearly twice as thick as the woody part. i. The Bark is composed of\
      \ two substances ; the pa* renchyma, or pulp, which is the principal part; and\
      \ a few, ' fcoody fibres. The parenchyma is exceedingly porous, and has a great\
      \ resemblance to a fpunge; for it Ihrivels considerably when dried, and dilates\
      \ to its former dimensions when infused in water. These pores or vessels are\
      \ not pervious so as to communicate with each other, but consist of diftindt\
      \ little cells or bladders, scarcely visible without the afiiftance of the microfcope.\
      \ In all roots, these cells are constantly filled with a thin watery liquor.\
      \ They are generally of a spherical figure; though in some roots, as die bugloss\
      \ and dandelion, they are oblong. In many roots, as the horse-raddilh, peony,\
      \ afparagus, potatoe, <fac, the parenchyma is of one uniform ftrufture. But\
      \ in others it is more diversified, and puts on the shape of rays running from\
      \ the centre towards the circumference of the bark. These rays sometimes run\
      \ quite through the bark, as in loyage ; and Ibiwetimes advance towards the\
      \ middle of it, as in melilot and most of the Leguminous and umbelliferous plants.\
      \ These rays generally stand at an equal distance from each other in the same\
      \ plant; but the distance' varies greatly in different plants. Neither are t\
      \ hey of equal sizes : In carrot they are exceedingly small, and scarcely discernible\
      \ ; in melilot and cherval, they aie thicker. They are likewise more numerous\
      \ in some plants than in' others. Sometimes they are of\"the same thjekness\
      \ from one edge of the bark to the other; and fonie grow wiser as they approach\
      \ towards the Ikin. Thn vessels with which these rays are amply furnilhed, are\
      \ supposed to be air-vessels, because they are always found to be dry, and not\
      \ so transparent as the vessels which evidcntly contain the lap. LTURE.\u2018\
      \ In all roots, there are lignous vessels dilperfed in different proportions\
      \ through the parenchyma of the bark. These lignous vefiels run longitudinally\
      \ through the bark in the form of small threads, which are tubular, as is evident\
      \ from the rising of the sap in them when a root is cut tranfverfely. These\
      \ lignous sap-vessels do not run in dired lines through the bark, but, at small\
      \ distances, incline towards one another in fiich a manner, that they appear\
      \ to the naked eye to be inofculated; but the microfcope difeovers them to be\
      \ only contiguous, and braced together by the parenchyma. These braces -or coardations\
      \ are very various both in size and number in different-roots; but in all plants\
      \ tliey are most numerous towards the inner edge of the bark. Neither are these\
      \ vessels Angle tubes, but, like the nerves in animals, are bundles of twenty\
      \ or thirty small contiguous cylindrical tubes, which , uniformly run from the\
      \ extremity, of the root, without sending off any branches, or suffering any\
      \ change in their size or ftiape. In some roots, as parfnip, especially in the\
      \ ring next, the inner extremity of the bark, these vefiels contain a kind of\
      \ lymph, which is sweeter than the sap contained in the bladders of the parenchyma.\
      \ From this circumstance they have got the name of lymph-dufis. These lymph-duds\
      \ sometimes yield a mucilaginous, lymph, as in the comphrey; and sometimes a\
      \ white milky glutinous lymph, as in the angelica, fonchus, burdock, fcorzonera,\
      \ dandelion, ere. The lymph-duds are supposed to be the veflels from which the\
      \ gums and balfams are fecerned. The lymph of fennil, when exposed to the air,\
      \ turns into a clear transparent balsam; and that of the fcorzonera, dandelion,\
      \ <bc. condenses into a gum. The situation of the vessels is various. In some\
      \ plants,\u2019 they stand in a ring or circle at the inner edge of the bark,\
      \ as in afparagus ; in others, they appear in lines, or rays, as in berage;\
      \ in the parfnip, and several other plants, they are most conspicuous toward\
      \ the outer edge of the bark; and in the dandelion, they are disposed in the\
      \ form of concentric circles. 2. The Wood of roots is that part which appears\
      \ after the bark is taken off, and is firmer and less porous than the bark or\
      \ pith. It consists of two diftind substances, viz. the pulpy, or parenchymatous,\
      \ and the lignous. The wood is conneded to the bark by la Vge portions of the\
      \ bark inferred into it. These infertions are mostly in the form of rays, tending\
      \ to the centre of the pith,, which are easily discernible by the eye in a transverse\
      \ fedion of most roots. These infertions, like the bark, consist of many vessels,\
      \ mostly of a round or, oval figure. , The lignous vessels are generally disposed\
      \ in collateralrows running longitudinally through the root. Some of these contain\
      \ air, and others sap. The a:r-vessels are lo called, because they contain.no\
      \ liquor. 7\u2019^tfe air-vessels are diftinguiftied by being whiter than the\
      \ others. 3. The Pith is the centrical part of the root. Some roots have no\
      \ pith, as the ftramonium, nicotiana, others have little or none at the extremities\
      \ of the roots, but have a considerable quantity of it near the top. The pith,\
      \ like every other part of a plant, is derived from"

      in poliflring. These particles are not allowed to be lod; others are ready to
      receive them from the polifirers
    : - "and to employ them in some other part of the work. Each comb has two rows\
        \ of ceils opposite to each other, which have their common bases. The thickness\
        \ of every comb is something less than an inch, and the depth of the cells\
        \ is about five lines. Almod all the combs are built with cells of this size;\
        \ except a small number of a larger kind, that are dedined for the Worms that\
        \ produce drones. The bases of all the combs are placed at such a distance\
        \ from one another, that, when the cells are finiihed, there is only a space\
        \ left sufficient for the paflage of two bees abread. These combs are not\
        \ continued from top to bottom, but are often interrupted, and have openings\
        \ from one pafiage to another, which give a more easy and diorter communication.\
        \ The queen-bee i^ generally concealed in the mod fefcret part of the hive,\
        \ and is never visible but when (1\xAB lays her eggs in such combs as are\
        \ exposed to sight. When (he does appear, (lie is always attended by ten or\
        \ a dozen of the common sort, who form a' kind of retinue, and follow her\
        \ where-ever (he goes with a fedate and grave tread. Befor* (he lays her eggs,\
        \ (he examines the cells where (He designs to lay them ; and if (he finds\
        \ that they contain neither honey, wax, nor any embrio, (lie -introduces the\
        \ poderior part of her body into a cell, and sixes to the bottom of it a small\
        \ white egg, which is composed of a thin white membrane, full of a whitish\
        \ liquor. In this manner (he goes on, till (lie fills as many cells as (he\
        \ has eggs to lay, which are generally many thousands. After the eggs lie\
        \ four days in the cells, they appear in the form of small caterpillars ;\
        \ and gene^ rally ,lie twided round, so that the two extremities touch each\
        \ other. 7 he bees then supply them with a little ho-\u2018 ney for food,\
        \ ;he quantity of which they increase till the eighth day from the birth of\
        \ the caterpillar. After this,\" the bees discover no more care about their\
        \ young; but dop up the mouths of the cells with wax. The embrios lie in this\
        \ (late twelve days, during which time they, undergo surprising changes. They\
        \ fird change their situation in the cells, and indead of being rolled up,\
        \ they extend themselves along, and pl^ce their heads towards the mouth of\
        \ the cell; after this, the head of the worm begins to have a small extension,\
        \ which is the rudiment of the probofeis: Upon the head there is likewise\

        \ the back: The fird lineaments of the feet likewise appear; but they are\
        \ very small. After the head is formed,, and the probofeis lengthened, all\
        \ the other parts display themselves fucceflively; so that .the whole worm\
        \ or embrio is changed into an aurelia or nymph, which is the fly almod perfeft,\
        \ except that it is yet white and soft, and wants that crud'with which it\
        \ is afterwards covered. By this transformation the worm is dripped of a white\

      \ cavity. The belly of the bee is divided into six rings or joints. In the inside\
      \ of the belly there is a small bladder or refervoir, in which the honey is\
      \ colle&ed, after having passed through the proboscis and a narrow pipe which\
      \ runs through the head and bread. This bladder, when full of honey, is about\
      \ the size of a small pea. The ding is situate at the extre-. jnity of the belly:\
      \ It is a horny fubdanee, and hollow within, for transmitting the venomous liquor,\
      \ which lies in a bladder near the anus, into the wound. The ding js generally\
      \ left in the wound, and frequently draws after it the poison-bag. As the mellefica,\
      \ or honey-bee, is both an useful infe<d, and endowed with peculiar indindts,\
      \ we lhall give a particular account of its nature and ceconomy. The queen is\
      \ the only female in a hive; (he is' didinguidied from the others by being taller,\
      \ more of an pblong figure, and having ten joints in each feeler.. She is likewise\
      \ furnifired with a ding. The fuci, males, or drones, are commonly about 1600\
      \ in a hive; they have no ding, and their feelers have eleven joints. The operafias,\
      \ fpadones, or working bees, are sometimes 20,000 in a hive; they have fifteen\
      \ joints in their feelers, and are armed with (tings. After a new swarm is formed,\
      \ the bees immediately begin to form their cells. They begin their work at the\
      \ upper part of the hive, and continue it downwards, and fiom one side to the\
      \ other. It is not easy to discover the particular manner of their working;\
      \ for, notwithstanding the many contrivances used for this purpose, , there,\
      \ are foch numbers in continual motion, and succeed one another with such rapidity,\
      \ that nothing but confusion appears to the sight. Some of them however have\
      \ been observed car Yying pieces of wax in their talons, and running to the\
      \ places where they are at work, upon the combs. The Ce they fallen to the work\
      \ by means of the same talons. Each bee is employed but a very (hort time in.\
      \ this .way ; but fhere is so great.a number of them that go on in a condant\
      \ fucceflion, that the comb increales vevy perceptibly. Besides these, there\
      \ are others that run about beating the work with their wings and the hinder\
      \ part pf their body, probably with a view -O make it more firrtl and solid.\
      \ The order they observe in the .condruftion of their cells is this: They begin\
      \ with laying the bails, which is composed of three rhombus\u2019s or lozenges.\
      \ They build fird one of the rhombus\u2019s, and draw faces on two of its sides;\
      \ they then add a second rhombus to the fird in a ' certain inclination, and\
      \ draw two new faces on its two sides ; and, lad of all, they add a third rhqmbus\
      \ to the two fird, and rai e on the two external sides of this rhombus tw ;\
      \ o other faces ; which completes the cell of an hexagonal figure. Whild part\
      \ of the bees are occupied in forming the cells, others are employed in pevfedting\
      \ and polilhing those that are new-modelled. This operation is performed by\
      \ their talons, taking off everything that is rough and uneven. These pohfhers\
      \ are not so desultory in their operations as those that make the cells; they\
      \ work long and diligently, never intermitting their labour, ex2 )"

        proportion, are the chief. Architedure being anufeful as well as a fine art,
        leads V. s to diflinguifh buildings, '' and parts of buildings, into three
        kinds,, viz. what arp intended for use solely, what for ornament solely, and
        what for both. Buildings intended for utility solely, ought in every part
        to correspond precisely to that intention: The leafl deviation from use, though
        contributing to ornament, will be disagreeable; for every work of use being
        considered as a mean to an end, its perfedion as a mean is the capital circumffance,
        and every other beauty in opposition is negledtd as improper. On the other
        hand, in such things as a:e intended solely for ornament, as columns, obe,Idles,
        triumphal arches, <&c. beauty alone ought to be regarded. The principal difficulty
        in architedure lies in combining use and ornament. In order to accomplish
        these ends, different and even opposite means muff be employed; which is the
        reason why they are so seldom united nifss, means the world as it exifled
        in the idea of God, before the visible creation.'

    ARCHITECTURE: "dows ought always to be proportioned to that of the room they are\
      \ destined to illuminate; for if the aper tures be not large enough to convey\
      \ light to every corner, the room mull be unequally lighted, which is a ^reat\
      \ deformity. Steps of Hairs Ihould likewile be accommodated to the human figure,\
      \ without regarding any other proportion; they are accordingly the same in large\
      \ and in small buildings, because both are inhabited by men of the same lize.\
      \ We shall next consider inlrinjtc beauty, blended with that which is relative.\
      \ A cube in itself is more agreeable than a parallelopipedon ; this conllantly\
      \ holds in small figures : But a large building in the form of a cube is lumpilh\
      \ and heavy; while a parallelopipedon, set on its smaller base, is more agreeable\
      \ on account of its elevation : Hence the beauty of Gothic towers. But if this\
      \ figure were to be used in a dwelling-house, to make way for relative beauty,\
      \ we would immediately perceive that utility ought chiefly to be regarded; and\
      \ this figure, inconvenient by its height, ought to be set on its larger base:\
      \ The loftiness in this caie would be lost; but that loss will be more than\
      \ sufficiently compensated by the additional convenience. Hence the form of\
      \ buildings spread more upon the ground than ra>fed in height, is always preferred\
      \ for a dwelling-house. With regard to the internal divisions, utility requires\
      \ that the rooms be re&angular, to avoid useless spaces. An hexagonal figure\
      \ leaves no void spaces ; but it determines the rooms to be all of one size,\
      \ which is both inconvenient and difigreeable for want of variety. Tho\u2019\
      \ a cube be the moll agreeable figure, and may answer for a room of a moderate\
      \ size; yet, in a very large room, utility requires a different figure. Unconfined\
      \ motion is the chief convenience of a great room; to obtain this, the greatest\
      \ length that.can be had is neceflary. But a square room of a large size is\
      \ inconvenient. It removes chairs, tables, <bc. at too great a distance from\
      \ the hand,, which, when unemployed, must be ranged along the sides of the room,\
      \ Utility therefore requires a large room to be a parallellogram. This figure\
      \ is likewise best calculated for the admifiion of light; because, to avoid\
      \ cross Jights, all the windows ought to be in one wall; and if the opposite\
      \ wall be at such a distance as not to be fully lighted, the room must be obscure.\
      \ The height of a room exceeding nine or ten feet,, has little relation to utility\
      \ ; therefore proportion is the only rule for determining the height, when above\
      \ that number of feet. Arnfts who deal in the Beautiful, love to entertain the\
      \ eye ; palaces and sumptuous buildings, in which intrinfic beauty may be fully\
      \ displayed, give them an opportunity of exerting their taste. But such a propensity\
      \ is peculiarly unhappy with regard to private dwelling-houses; \u2022because\
      \ in these, relative beauty cannot be displayed to perfeftion, without hurting,\
      \ intrinfic beauty. There is no opportunity for great variety of form in a,small\
      \ house ; and in edifices of this kind, internal convenience has not hitherto\
      \ been happily adjusted to external regularity. Perhaps an accurate coincidence\
      \ in -this refped is beyond the reach of art. Architects, however, constantly\
      \ split upon this rock; for they never can be perluadcd to give over attempting\
      \ to reconcile these two incompatibles: E C T U R E. 347 Plow otherwise ihould\
      \ it happen, that of the endless variety of private dwelling-houi' es, there\
      \ ihould not be one' found that is generally agreed upon as a good pattern ?\
      \ The unwearied propensity to make a house regular as well as convenient, obliges\
      \ the architect, in feme articles, to sacrifice convenience to regularity, and,\
      \ in others, regularity to convenience; and accordingly the house, which turns\
      \ out neither regular nor convenient, never sails to displease. Nothing can\
      \ be more evident, than that the form of a dwelling-house ought to be suited\
      \ to the climate; yet no error is more common than to copy in Britain the form\
      \ of Italian houses, not forgetting even those parts that are purposely contrived\
      \ for collecting air, and for excluding the sun: Witness our colonnades and\
      \ logics, designed by the Italians to gather cool air, and exclude the beams\
      \ of the sun, conveniencies which the climate of this country does not require.\
      \ We ftiali next view architecture as one of the fine arts ; which will lead\
      \ us to the examination of such buildings, and parts of buildings, as are calculated\
      \ solely to please the eye. Variety prevails in the works of nature ; but. art\
      \ requires to be guided by rule and compass. Hence it is, that in such works\
      \ of art as imitate nature, the great art is, to hide every appearance of art;\
      \ which is done by avoiding regularity, and indulging variety. But in. works\
      \ of art that are original and not imitative, such as architecture, strict regularity\
      \ and uniformity ought to be studied, so far as confident with utility. Proportion\
      \ is not less agreeable than regularity and uniformity; and therefore, in buildings\
      \ intended to please . the eye, they are all equally essential. It is taken\
      \ for granted by many writers, that in all the parts of a building there are\
      \ certain strict proportions which please the eye, in the same manner as in\
      \ found there are certain ftri Cl proportions which please the ear; and that,\
      \ in both, the slighted deviation is equally disagreeable. Others; seem to relilh\
      \ more a comparison between proportion in numbers, and proportion in quantity;\
      \ and maintain, that the same proportions are agreeable in both. The proportions,\
      \ forexample, of the numbers 16, 24, and 36, are agreeable ; and so, say they,.\
      \ are the proportions of a room, whose height is 16 feet,. the breadth 24, and\
      \ the length 36. .But it ought to be considered, that there \u2022 is no refemblahce\
      \ or relation between the obje Cls of different senses. What pleases the ear\
      \ in harmony, is not the proportion of the firings of the instrument, but of\
      \ the found which these firings produce. In architecture, on the contrary,;\
      \ it is the proportion of different quantr ties : that pleases the eye, without\
      \ the leaf! relation to. found. The same thing may be said of numbers; Quantity\
      \ is a real quality of every body; number is not a real quality, but merely\
      \ an idea that arises upon viewing a plurality of things in fucceflion. An arithmetical\
      \ proportion is agreeable in numbers; but have we from this any reason to conclude,\
      \ that it must also be agreeable in quantity ? At this rate, a geometrical \u25A0\
      \ propor-. tion, and many others,, ought also to. be agreeable in both. A certain\
      \ proportion may coincide in quantity, and number; and amongst an endless--variety\
      \ of ,proportions, it would be wonderful if there never should be tu coincidence.-."

    ARCHITECTURE: "coincidence. One example is given of this coincidence, an the numbers\
      \ l6, 24, and 36 ; but to be convinced that it is merely accidental, we need\
      \ but refled, that the same proportions are not applicable to the external figure\
      \ of a \u2022houle, and far less to a column. It is' ludicrous to observe writers\
      \ acknowledging the necessity of accurate proportions, and yet differing widely\
      \ about them. Laying aside reasoning and philosophy, one sad universally agreed\
      \ on ought to have undeceived them, that the same proportions which please in\
      \ a model are not agreeable in a large building: A room 48 feet \u25A0 in length,\
      \ and 24 in breadth and height, is well proportioned ; but a room 12 feet wide\
      \ and high, and 24 long, approaches to a gallery. Perrault, in his comparison\
      \ of the ancients and moderns, goes to the opposite extreme, maintaining, that\
      \ the ,different proportions assigned to each order of columns are arbitrary,\
      \ and that the beauty of these proportions is entirely the effed of custom.\
      \ But he should have confl Jered, that if these proportions had not originally\
      \ been agreeable, they could never have been effablifhed by cuffom. For illustrating\
      \ this point, we fliall add a few examples of the agreeableness of different\
      \ proportions. In a sumptuous edifice, the capital rooms ought to be large,\
      \ otherwise they will not be proportioned to the size of the building; for the\
      \ same reason, a very large room is improper in a small house. But in things\
      \ thus related,_the mind requires not a precise or Angle proportion, rejeding\
      \ all others; on the contrary, many different proportions are equally agreeable.\
      \ It is only when a proportion becomes loose and diflant, that the agreeableness\
      \ abates, and at last vanishes. Accordingly, in buildings, rooms of different\
      \ proportions are found to be equally agreeable, even where the proportion is\
      \ not influenced by -utility. With regard to the proportion the height of a\
      \ room Ihould bear to the length and breadth, it muff be extremely arbitrary,\
      \ considering the uncertainty of the eye as to the height of a room when*it\
      \ exceeds 16 or 17 feet. In columns, again, every archited muff confess, that\
      \ the proportion of height and thickness varies betwixt 8 diameters and 10,\
      \ and that every proportion between these two extremes is agreeable. Besides,\
      \ there muff certainly be a further variation of proportion, depending on the\
      \ size of the column : A row of columns 10 feet high, and a row twice that height,\
      \ requires different proportions: The intercolumniations muff allb differ in\
      \ proportion according to the height of the row. Proportion of parts is not\
      \ only itself a beauty, but is infeparably conneded with a beauty of the highest\
      \ relish, that of concord and harmony ; which will be plain from what follows\
      \ : A room, the parts of which are all finely adj uffed to each pther, strikes\
      \ us not only with the beauty of proportion, hut with a pleasure far superior.\
      \ The length, the breadth, the height, the windows, raise each of them a separate\
      \ emotion: These emotions are similar; and,, though saint' when separately felt.,\
      \ they produce, in conjundion, the emotion of concord or harmony, which is very\
      \ pleasant. On the other hand, where the length of a room far exceeds the breadth,\
      \ the mind, comparing together parts so intimately conneded, immediately per\
      \ E C T U R E. ceives a disagreement or disproportion which difgufts. Hence\
      \ a long gallery, however convenient for exercise, is not an agreeable figure\
      \ of a room. In buildings deflined chiefly or solely to please the eye, regularity\
      \ and proportion are essentially necessary, because they are the means of producing\
      \ intrinfic beauty. But a fldlful artist will not confine his view to regularity\
      \ and proportion; he will also study congruity, which is perceived when the\
      \ form and ornaments of a ftrudure are suited to the purpose for which it is\
      \ appointed. Hence every building ought to have an expreflion suited to. its\
      \ destination. ' A palace ought to be sumptuous and grand; a private dwelling,\
      \ neat and modest; a playhouse, gay and splendid; and a monument, gloomy and\
      \ melancholy. A heathen temple has a double deflination: It is considered as\
      \ a house dedicated to some divinity; therefore it ought to grand, elevated,\
      \ and magnificent : It is also confidefed as a place of worship; and therefore\u2019\
      \ ought to be somewhat dark and gloomy, because dimness or obscurity produces\
      \ that tone of mind which is favourable to humility and devotion. Columns, besides\
      \ their chief destination of being supports, contribute to .that peculiar expreflion\
      \ which the destination of a building requires: Columns of different proportions\
      \ serve to express loftiness, lightness, &C. as well as strength. Situation\
      \ may also contribute to expreflion: Conveniency regulates the situation of\
      \ a private dweliing-house; and the situation of a palace ought to be lofty.\
      \ This leads to a question, Whether the situation, where there happens to be\
      \ no choice, ought, in any measure, to regulate the form of the edifice ? The\
      \ conne&ion between a great house and a neighbouring field, though not extremely\
      \ intimate, demands however some congruity. It would, for example, displease\
      \ us to find an elegant building thrown away upon a wild uncultivated country:\
      \ Congruity requires a polished field for such a building. The old Gothic form\
      \ of building was well suited to the rough uncultivated regions where it was\
      \ invented ; but was very ill adapted to the fine plains of France and Italy.\
      \ The external ftruflure of a house leads naturally to its internal ftrudure.\
      \ A large and spacious room, which is the first that commonly receives us, is\
      \ a bad contrivance in several refpeds. In the first place, when immediately\
      \ from the open air we step into such a room, its ftze in appearance is diminished\
      \ by contrast; it looks little, compared with the great canopy of the sky. In\
      \ the next place, when at recovers its grandeur, as it soon doth, it gives a\
      \ diminutive appearance to the rest of the house. palling from it, ev6ry apartment\
      \ looks little. In the third place, by its situation it serves only for a waiting-room,\
      \ and a passage to the principal apartments. Rejeding therefore this form, a\
      \ hint may be taken from the climax in writing for another that appears more\
      \ suitable: A handsome portico, proportioned to the size and fashion of the\
      \ front, leads into a waiting-room of a larger size, and this to the great room,\
      \ all by a progression from small to great. Grandeur is the principal emotion\
      \ that architedure is capable of raising in the mind: it might therefore be\
      \ the chief study of the artist, in great buildings destined to"

    ARCHITECTURE: "to please the eye. But as grandeur depends partly on lize, it is\
      \ unlucky for ardiite&ure that it is governed by regularity and proportion,\
      \ which never deceive the eye by making objects appear larger than they are\
      \ in reality. But though regularity and proportion contribute nothing to grandeur,\
      \ so far as that emolion depends on size ; yet they contribute greatly to it\
      \ by confining the size within such bounds that it can be taken in and examined\
      \ at one view; for, when objedts are so large as not to be comprehended but\
      \ in parts, they tend rather to diftradt than satisfy the mind. We fiiall next\
      \ pass to Tuch ornaments as contribute to give buildings a peculiar expression.\
      \ It has been doubted, whether a building can regularly admit any ornament but\
      \ what is useful, or at least has that appearance. But, considering the double\
      \ aim of architedture as a fine, as well as an useful art, there is no reason\
      \ why ornaments may not be added to please the eye, without any relation to\
      \ utility. A private dwelling-house, it.is true, and other edifices, where use\
      \ is the chief aim, admit not regularly any ornament but what has\" at least\
      \ the appearance of use : But temples, triumphal arches, and other buildings\
      \ intended chiefly or solely for ftiow, may be highly ornamented. This suggests\
      \ a division of ornaments into three kinds, l viz. x. Ornaments that are beautiful\
      \ without relation to use; such as statues, vafes, baflbor alto relievo : 2.\
      \ Things in themselves not beautiful, but poflefling the beauty of utility,\
      \ by imposing on the fpedtator, and appearing to be useful ; such' as blind\
      \ windows : \u2022 Where things are beautiful in themselves,\xABand at the same\
      \ time take on the appearance of use; such as pilasters. Witfi regard to the\
      \ Jir J}, we naturally require that a statue be so placed, as to be seen in\
      \ every diredtion, and examined at different distances. Statues, therefore,,\
      \ are properly introduced to adorn the great stair that leads to to the principal\
      \ door of a palace, or to lessen the void between pillars. But a niche in the\
      \ external front is an improper place for a statue. There is-an additional reason\
      \ against placing them upon the roof or top of the walls; their r' cklifh situation\
      \ gives pain, as they have the appearance of being in danger of tumbling down\
      \ ; besides, we are inclined to feel from their being too much exposed to the\
      \ inclemencies of the weather. To adorn the top of the wall with a row of vafes,\
      \ is an unhappy conceit, by placing a thing, whose natural destination is utility,\
      \ where it cannot have even the appearance of use. As to carvings upon the external\
      \ surface of a building, termed bajfo relievo ' when flat, and alto relievo\
      \ when prominent, all contradidtory exprefiions ought to be avoided. Now, firmness\
      \ and solidity being the proper expreflions of a pedestal, and, on the contrary,\
      \ lightness and delicacy of carved work, the pedestal, whether of a column or\
      \ of a statue, ought to be sparingly ornamented. The ancients never ventured\
      \ any bolder ornament than the baflb relievo. With refpedt to-ornaments df thefecond\
      \ kind, it is a great blunder to contrive them so as to make them appear useless.\
      \ A blind window, therefore, when neceflary for regularity,, ought to be so\
      \ disguised as to appear a real window: When it appears without disguise, it\
      \ is difguftVol*. I. Numb. 15. E C T U R E. 349 ful, as a vain-attempt to supply\
      \ the want of invention ; it Ihows the irregularity in a stronger light, by\
      \ signifying that a window ought to be there in point of regularity, but that\
      \ the architedt had notfkill (uflicient to connedl external regularity with\
      \ internahconvCnience. As to xhe third, it is an error to sink pilasters so\
      \ far into the wall, as to remove totally, or mostly, the appearance of use.\
      \ They ilxould always projedt so mucir from the wall, as to have the appearance\
      \ of supporting the entablature over them. From ornaments in general, we defeend\
      \ to a pillar^ the chief ornament in great buildings. The ideftination of a\
      \ pillar is to support, really or in appearance, another part termed the entablature.\
      \ With regard to the form of a pillar, it must be observed, that a circle is\
      \ a more agreeable figure than a square, a globe than' a cube, and a cylinder\
      \ than a parallellopipedon. This last, in the language of architedture, is saying,\
      \ that a column is a more agreeable figure than a pilafter; and for that reason\
      \ it ought to be preferred, when all other, circumstances are equal. Another\
      \ reason concurs, that a column annexed to a wall, which is a plaip surface,\
      \ makes a greater variety than a*pilafter. Besides, pilasters at a distance\
      \ are apt to be mistaken for pillars ; and the fpedtator is disappointed when,\
      \ on a nearer approach, he difeovers them to b V only pilasters. As to the parts\
      \ of a column, a bare uniform cylinder, without a capital, appears naked; and\
      \ without a bate, appears too -ticklifhly placed to stand firm j It ought therefore\
      \ to have some finiflxing at the top and bottom: Hence the three chief parts\
      \ of a column, the flxaft, the base, and the capital. Nature undoubtedly requires\
      \ proportion among these parts, but it admits of variety of proportion. Vitruvius\
      \ and some of the elder writers seem to think, that the proportions of columns\
      \ were derived from the human figure, the capital representing the head, the\
      \ base the feet, and the fliaft the body. The Tuscan has been -accordingly denominated\
      \ the Gigantic ; the Doric, the Herculean; the Ionic, the Matronal ; and the\
      \ Corinthian, the Virginal:\u2014the Cbmpofite is a mixture of the Corinthian\
      \ and Ionic. As to the-base, the principle of utility interposes to vary it\
      \ from the human figure, and to proportion it so to the whole, as to give the\
      \ column the appearance of liability. Among the Greeks, we find only three orders\
      \ of columns, the Doric, the Ionic, and the Corinthian, diftinguiflred from\
      \ each other by their fteftination as well as by their ornaments. It has been\
      \ disputed, whether any new order can be added to these : Some hold the affirmative,\
      \ and give for instances the Tuscan and Compofite ; others maintain, that these\
      \ properly are not diftihtf: orders, but only the original orders with some\
      \ flight variation. The only circumstances that can serve to diftinguifli one\
      \ order from another, are the form of the column, and its destination. To make\
      \ the first a diftinguiffiing mark without regard to the other, would multiply\
      \ orders without end. Destination is more limited, and it leads us to diftinguifti\
      \ three kinds of orders ; one plain and strong, for the purpose of supporting\
      \ plain and mafly buildings ; one delicate and graceful, for supporting buildings\
      \ of that charafier; and between these, a 4 T _ _ third,"

    "AS Of the Origin o/\u2019Buildings.\"O Uixdings":
    - " SECOFARCHITECTURE in the first ages of society, behoved to be extremely rude.\
      \ The first huts were probably of a conic figure, being the most simple, and\
      \ belt adapted to the materials that could be obtained in such an uncultivated\
      \ state of society. These huts were formed of branches of trees, covered with\
      \ reeds, leaves, and clay. But, finding the conic figure inconvenient, on account\
      \ of its inclined sides, they changed it into a cubical one, in -the following\
      \ manner: They fixed in the ground several upright trees to form the lides,\
      \ filling the intervals between them with branches closely interwoven, and covered\
      \ with clay. The lides being thus compleated, four large beams were placed on\
      \ the upright trunks, which, being well joined at the angles, kept the sides\
      \ firm ; and likewise served to support the roof, which was composed of many\
      \ joifts, covered with reeds, leaves, and clay. As men improved in the art of\
      \ building, new methods of rendering their huts lasting and handsome were gradually\
      \ invented. Thfy took off the bark and other unevennefies from the trunks of\
      \ the trees that formed the lides, and raised them above the dirt on stones.\
      \ The spaces between the ends of the joifts were closed with clay, and the ends\
      \ of them were covered with thin boards, cut in the form of triglyphs, \xAB\
      Sr<r. From this simple conftr.u&ion the different orders of architedhire took\
      \ their rise. When buildings of wood were laid aside, they imitated, in their\
      \ edifices of stone, vhe form which necessity had introduced into the primitive\
      \ huts: Hence the upright trees gave rise to the columns ; and the beams, joifts,\
      \ rafters, and strata of materials that formed the covering, suggested architraves,\
      \ frizes, triglyphs, and cornices. At what time, or by whom, the Grecian orders\
      \ were invented, is not certainly known. But the following is the account which\
      \ Vitruvius gives of them. Dprus, king of Achaia, and son of Helenes and Optica,\
      \ built a temple to Juno in the ancient city of Argos, which happened to be\
      \ in the manner now called Doric, from the name of the inventor. This manner\
      \ was afterwards imitated in many other temples in the several cities of Achaia.\
      \ ECTURE. other, dictated by beauty, is, that they also appear so to the eye\
      \ ; for every thing that appears tottering, and in hazard of tumbling down,\
      \ produceth in the fpedtator the painful emotion of fear, instead of the pleasing\
      \ emotion of beauty; and accordingly it should be the great care of the artist,\
      \ that every part of his edifice appear to be well supported. Some have introduced\
      \ a kind of conceit in architedlure, by giving parts of buildings the appearance\
      \ of falling; of this kind is the church of St Sophia in Constantinople; the\
      \ ro\\md towers in the uppermost stories of Gothic buildings is in the same\
      \ false taste. T.II.AMECHANICALART. The Athenians, about the same time, sent\
      \ thirteen colonies into Alia, under the cqmmand of Ion, son of Xuthus and Creufa.\
      \ This Ion conquered all Caria, founded many cities, and called the country\
      \ Ionia. The firlt temple he built was after the Doric manner. But afterwards\
      \ he built a temple to Diana of a more delicate structure, and formed upon the\
      \ proportions of a female body, as the Doric had been on those of a robust man.\
      \ The capital was adorned with volutes, to represent the curls of a woman\u2019\
      s hair; and flutingswere cut on the Ihaft of the column, in imitation of the\
      \ folds of her garment. This order got the name of Ionic, in honour of the lonians\
      \ who invented it. The third sort of columns, called Corinthian, are said to\
      \ owe their origin to the following accident:\u2014A young girl of Corinth having\
      \ died, her nurse placed on her tomb a balket, containing certain trinkets,\
      \ in which she delighted wh\xA3n alive, and covered it with a tyle to prevent\
      \ the rain from spoiling them. The balket happened to be placed on a root of\
      \ acanthus, which pushing out its leaves in the spring, covered the sides of\
      \ the balket; some of the longest of which, being obftrudted by the corners\
      \ of the tyle, were forced downwards, and curled in the manner of volutes. Calimachus\
      \ the fculptor, passing near the tomb, was so pleased with the beautiful appearance\
      \ of the acanthus growing in this manner, that he imitated it in the columns\
      \ which he afterwards made at Corinth. Villalpandus treats this story of Calimachus\
      \ as a sable, and maintains that the Corinthian capital took its origin from\
      \ an order in Solomon\u2019s temple; and it must be acknowledged, that some\
      \ descriptions in the Bible favour this opinion. Besides these three orders,\
      \ said to be invented by the Greeks, two other, viz. the Tufcanand Compofite,\
      \ are thought to have been invented by the Romans. The Tuscan first appeared\
      \ in Tuscany, before the Romans had any intercourse with the Greeks. The Compofite\
      \ is a mixture of the Ionic' and Corinthian. These five manners of building,\
      \ invented by the ancients, are called Orders, on account d\xA3 the regularity\
      \ and beauty of their forms. Of"

    ri: "architecture. Of the Farts that compose an Order, and their Ornament*, The\
      \ parts that compose an ordef may be distributed into two different classes.\
      \ In the firji may be ranged all that have^any analogy to the primitive huts,\
      \ and represent i' ome part that was necessary in their conftiudion. Such are\
      \ the draft of the column, with the plinth of its base, and the abacus of its\
      \ capital, representing the upright trees, with the (tones on which they were\
      \ placed, and those that covered them ; likewise the architrave and triglyphs,\
      \ representing the beams and joifts ; the mutules, modilions, or dentils, which\
      \ all of them represent the rafters, or some other pieces of timber used to\
      \ support the covering; and the corona, representing the beds of materials that\
      \ composed the covering. All these may properly be diftinguilhed by the name\
      \ of essential members. The fubfervient parts, contrived for the use or ornament\
      \ of the former, and commonly called mouldings, may conftitute the fecund class.\
      \ There are eight regular mouldings in ornamenting columns ; the fillet, Mel,\
      \ or square; the aftragal, or bead; the torus, or tore; the scotia, mouth, or\
      \ casement; the echinus, ovolo, or quarter-round; the inverted cyma, talon,\
      \ or ogee; the cyma, cyma refta, or cymatium ; the cavetto, or hollow. The names\
      \ of these allude to their forms, and their forms are adapted to the purposes\
      \ for which they are intended. See Plate XXVII. The ovolo and talon, as they\
      \ are strong at the extremities, are sit for supports ; the cyma and cavetto,.\
      \ tho' improper for supports, serve for coverings to (belter other members;\
      \ the torus and aftragal, being (haped like ropes, are intended to bind and\
      \ fortify the parts with which they are conne&ed: But the use of the scotia\
      \ and fillet. Is only to separate and diftinguifli the other mouldings, to give\
      \ a graceful turn to the profile, and to prevent the confusion which would arise\
      \ from joining several curved members together. There are various methods of\
      \ describing the contours of moulding*; but the fimplelt and bed is to form\
      \ them of quadrants of circles, as in Plate XXVII. An assemblage of what are.\
      \ called essential parts and mouldings, is termed a prcfile. The most perfeft\
      \ profiles are such as are composed of few mouldings, varied in form and size;\
      \ and so disposed, that the streight and curved ones succeed each other alternately.\
      \ When \u25A0 ornaments are employed in. mouldings, some of them (hould be left\
      \ plain, in order to give a proper repose : For, when all are ornamented, the\
      \ figure of the profile is lost. Of the Orders of Architecture. An Order consists\
      \ of two principal members, the Column and the Entablature; each of which is\
      \ compqfed of three principal parts. Those of the Coturn,i are, the Base, the\
      \ Shaft, and the Capital-, and those of the Entablature are, Jr chit rave, the\
      \ Fr/a.?, and the Cornice. All these are (ubdivided into many lesser parts,\
      \ whose number, form, and dimensions chara&erife each order, and express the\
      \ degree of (trength, delicacy, richness, or simplicity peculiar to it. i. OF\
      \ THE TUSCAN. The Tuscan (Plate XXIV.) is the most: solid and simple of all\
      \ the orders. It is composed of few parts, devoid of ornaments, and so massy,\
      \ that its seems capable of supporting the heaviest burden. There are no remains\
      \ of a regular Tuscan order among the antiques ; the dodtrine of Vitruvius concerning\
      \ it is obscure; and the profiles of Palladio, Scamozzi, Serlio, de P Orme,\
      \ and Vignola, are all imperfeA. The. height of the Tuscan column is 14 modules,or\
      \ femidiameters, each confiding of 3,0 minutes; aud that of the whole entablature\
      \ 3modules ; which being divided into 10 equal parts, three of them\u2019 are\
      \ for the height of the architrave, three for the freeze, and the remaining\
      \ four for the cornice t The capital is one module ; the base, including the\
      \ lower cincture of the (hast, is likewise one module;, and die (hast, with\
      \ its upper cindture and aftragal, 12 modules. These are the general dimensions\
      \ of the order; the particular dimensions may be learned by inlpedtion of the\
      \ plates. In the remains of antiquity, the quantity of diminution at the top\
      \ of the Tuscan column is various; but seldom less than one eighth, nor more\
      \ than one sixth of the inferior diameter of the column. The last of these is\
      \ generally preferred; and Chalmers and others make \u201Cthe same diminution\
      \ in all columns, without regard to their order. 2. OF THE DORIC ORDER. The\
      \ Doric Order, (Plate XXV.) is next in strength to the Tuscan; and being of\
      \ a grave, robust, and mafeuline afpedt, is by Scamozzi called the Herculean.\
      \ As it is the most ancient of all. the orders, it retains more of the (trudture\
      \ of the primitive huts than any of the rest ; the triglyphs m its freeze representing\
      \ the ^nds of the joifts ; and the mutules in its cornice, representing the\
      \ rafters. The height of the Doric column, including its capita! and base, is\
      \ 16 modules, and the height of the entablature four; the latter of which being\
      \ divided into eight parts, two of them are for the architrave, three for the\
      \ fuze, and three for the cornice.. \u2018 In most of the antiques, the Doric\
      \ column is executed, without a base. Vitruv ius likewise makes it without one\
      \ ; the base, according to him, having been first employed in the Ionic order,\
      \ in imitation of the sandal of a woman\u2019s foot. Scamozzi blames this pradfice,\
      \ and most: of the modern architedfs are of his Opinion. In the profile of the\
      \ theatre of Marcellus, the frize is enriched with hulks and roses; the architrave\
      \ consists only of one fafeia and a fillet; the drops are conical;, the metope\
      \ is enriched with a bull\u2019s (ku U, adorned with a garland of beads, in\
      \ imitation of those on the temple of Jupiter Tonans at the foot of the Capitol.\
      \ In feme antique fragments, and in a great many mordern buildings, the metopes\
      \ are alternately adorned with ox-(kulls and pateras. But they may be filled\
      \ with any other ornaments, according to the tkftination of the,building. 3:.\

    ARCII1TECTURE: "3 . OF THE IONIC ORDER. Tke Ionjc Order (Plate XXVL) xsof anioreflender\
      \ make than the Doric or Tufcan; its appearance is simple, yet^raceful andmajeftic;\
      \ its ornaments are few; so that it has been compared to a fedate matron, in\
      \ decent, rather than magnificent attire. Among the ancients, the form, of the\
      \ Ionic profile appears to have been more positively determined than that of\
      \ any other order; for, in all the antiques at Rome, (the temple of Concord\
      \ excepted) it is exadtly the same. The modern aftifb have likewise been unanimous\
      \ in their opinions; all of them, excepting Palladio and his imitators, having\
      \ employed the dentil, cornice, and the other parts of the profile, nearly as\
      \ they are found in the Collifeum, the temple of Fortune, and the theatre of\
      \ Maro.Hus. The height of the Ionic column is 18 modules, and that of the entablature\
      \ or one quarter of the height of the column, as in the other orders, which\
      \ is a trifle less than in any of the antique Ionics.. In all the antiques,\
      \ the base is Attic; and the lhaft of the column may either be plain, or fluted\
      \ with 24 flutings, or 20 only, as in the temple of Fortune. The plan, of the\
      \ flutings may be a trifle more than, a semicircle, as in the forum of Nerva,\
      \ because they then appear more diflind. The fillets, ior intervals between\
      \ them, must not be broader than one third of the breadth of a fluting, nor\
      \ narrower than one fourth. The ornaments of the capital must correspond with\
      \ the flutings of the shaft; and there must be an ove above the middle of each\
      \ fluting. The volutes ought to be traced according to Mr Goldman\u2019s method,\
      \ which is as follows : Plate XXVII. fig. 9. Draw the cathetus F C, whose length\
      \ must be 15 minutes, or one fourth of a module ; and, from the point C, describe\
      \ the eye of the volute A E B D, of which the diameter is to be 6-fminutes;\
      \ divide it into four equal feftors by the diameters AB, DE. Bifett the radii\
      \ C A, C B, in 1 and 4; and on. the line 1, 4, conftrudt a square 1, 2, 3, 4.\
      \ From the centre C, to the angles 2, 3, draw the diagonals C 2, C 3, and divide\
      \ the side of the square 1, 4, into 6 equal parts, at 5, 9, C, 12, 8. Then through\
      \ the points 5, 9, 12, 8, draw the lines 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 11, 8, 7, parallel\
      \ to the diameter E D, which will cut the diagonals in 6, 7, 10, ii ; and the\
      \ points 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, will be the centres of the volute.\
      \ From the first centre 1, with the distance 1 F, describe the quadrant F G;\
      \ from the second centre 2, with the distance 2'G, describe the quadrant G H;\
      \ and, continuing the same operation from all the 12 centres, the eontour of\
      \ the volute will be completed. Fig. 10. The centres for describing the fillet\
      \ are found in this manner. Conftrudt a triangle, of which the side A F is equal\
      \ to the part of the cathetus contained between A F and the side F V, equal\
      \ to C 1 ; place the distance F S from F towards A, equal to F S the breadth\
      \ of the fillet, and through the point S draw the line S T, which will be to\
      \ C 1 in the same proportion as A S is to A F; place this line on the diameter\
      \ of the eye A B ; E C T U RE. divide it into three equal parts ; and, through\
      \ the points of division, draw lines parallel to the diameter E D, which will\
      \ cut the diagonals C' 2, C 3, and you will have twelve new centres, from whence\
      \ the interior contour of the fillet may be described, in the same manner as\
      \ the exterior one was from the first centres. 4. OF THE CORINTHIAN ORDER. The\
      \ proportions of this order are extremely delicate. It is divided into a great\
      \ variety of members, and enriched with a profusion of ornaments. Scamozzi calls\
      \ it.the virginal order) and indeed it has all the delicacy in its make, and\
      \ all the gaiety in its dress, peculiar to young girls. See Plate XXVIII. The\
      \ most perfect model of the Corinthian order is generally allowed to be in the\
      \ three columns in the Campo Vaccino at Rome, the remains, as it is thought,\
      \ of the temple of Jupiter Stator, The Corinthian column should be20 modules\
      \ high, and the entablature 5 ; which proportions are a medium between those\
      \ of the Panthreon and the three columns. The base of the column may either\
      \ be Attic or Corinthian : They are both beautiful. If the entablature be enriched,\
      \ the shaft may be fluted. The flutings may be filled, to one third of their\
      \ height, with cablings, as in the inside of the Panthaeon ; which will strengthen\
      \ the lower part of the column, and make it less liable to injury. In most of\
      \ the antiques at Rome, the capital of this order is enriched with olive-leaves;\
      \ the acanthus being seldom employed but in the Compofite. De Cordemoy, however,\
      \ prefers the .acanthus. The divisions of the entablature bear the same proportions\
      \ to each other, as in the Tuscan, Ionic, and Compofite orders. 5. OF THE COMPOSITE.\
      \ The Composite is, ftridtly speaking, only a species of the Corinthian; and\
      \ therefore retains, in a great measure, the same charadter. See Plate XXIX.\
      \ It does not appear that the ancients affedted any particular form of entablature\
      \ to this order. Sometimes the cornice is entirely plain, as in the temple of\
      \ Bacchus; at others, as in the arch of Septimius Severus, it is enriched with\
      \ dentils differing very little from the Ionic ; and in the arch of Titus, there\
      \ are both dentils and modilions ; the whole Tomr of the profile ' being the\
      \ same with the Corinthian, as executed in the antiques at Rome. The modern\
      \ architedts have varied more in this than in any other order, each following\
      \ the bent of his own fancy. The height of the Gompofite column, and parts of\
      \ the entablature, is the same with that of the Corinthian. The foot of the\
      \ leaves of the capital ought not to projedt beyond the upper part of the shaft.\
      \ The different bunches of leaves should be strongly marked; the sprigs which\
      \ arise between the upper ones should be kept flat upon the vafe; and the ornaments\
      \ of the volutes must not projedt beyond the fillets that inclose them."
