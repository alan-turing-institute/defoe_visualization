  clean_text: PREFACE. In submitting to the Public the accompanying Plans of the Burgh
    and other Towns of note in Scotland, the Publisher has been induced thereto by
    the solicitation of his Friends and a number of Subscribers, at whose suggestion
    a short account of each Town is added. The developement of knowledge naturally
    increases the desire to obtain it ; and amongst Other means of exciting additional
    interest, the knowledge of our own Localities, though frequently neglected, is
    certainly not the least important. Our own Island still affords sufficient materials
    for the Antiquary, and the northern portion of it especially, not only illustrates,
    by its more ancient features, many

    presents, in the striking improvements of modern times, a spectacle highly gratifying
    to the Philanthropist, and to all who are interested in the science of Political
    Economy. It is therefore hoped, that the present Collection of Engraved Plans,
    executed with such precision, that even the smallest Dwelling-house is laid down,
    will be found useful, both as indicating the situation and present condition of
    many of those ancient habitations, which occupy so conspicuous a place in the
    history of former days, and as exemplifying the progress of improvement during
    recent times. In a mercantile point of view, the work will serve the purpose of
    a Directory, by pointing out, not only the situation of such Towns as are distinguished
    for particular manufactures, but also, the precise spot where the manufactories
    are to be found ; while to those entrusted with the management of the Burghs themselves,
    the Plans will naturally suggest the best and most convenient mode of efFecting
    their future improvement and extension.

    \ name, is situated in North Latitude 57\xB05', and 2\xB024' West Longitude, from\
    \ the Royal Observatory at Greenwich. It is divided into the Old and New Town.\
    \ What is called the New Town, however, is in reality Nc$ the most ancient of\
    \ the two, and only acquired its preto sent distinctive appellation when rebuilt\
    \ after its dev. struction by the English in the year 1336. The Ne\u0175 | Town\
    \ has in general a southern exposure, being situj ated on the north bank of the\
    \ river Dee, at a short distance from its efflux into the sea. The Old Town, which\
    \ may almost be regarded as a continuation of the New, stretches to the north.\
    \ It consists of little more than one main street, and extends to the margin of\
    \ a reach in the river Don, at the distance of nearly a mile from the sea. The\
    \ name Aberdeen, in the Gaelic Obairreadhain> signifies a space of ground between\
    \ the confluence of two rivers. This appellation corresponds exactly with the\
    \ situation of the town in ancient times. The river Don, till the beginning of\
    \ the last century, had its course through the Old Town links, emptying itself\
    \ into the ocean on the south side of the Broad-hill, near the northeast corner\
    \ of the boundary of the city royalty ; \u2014 A"

    that at a remote period it joined the Dee a little to the east of the Castle-hill
    ; for existing documents shew, that so lately as the reign of James V. the main
    channel of the Dee, unconfined by bulwarks as at present, skirted the high ground
    on which Castle-Street is built. Aberdeen proper, or what has latterly been termed
    the New Town, is a place of very considerable antiquity. It appears to have been
    known to the Romans, under the name of Devana, towards the close of the first
    century of the Christian era. The few huts, of which at that time it must have
    consisted, seem to have been situated in the immediate vicinity of the street
    now designated the Green. This, with Shiprow, is unquestionably the most ancient
    part of the town. In the course of time, the buildings appear to have gradually
    extended up the ridge now occupied by Broad-Street and Gallowgate. The Castle-hill
    appears to have been occupied at a remote period as a fortress ; but there were
    no houses on the south side of Castle-Street till after the commencement of the
    16th century, and the low grounds adjoining the quay were not gained from the
    river till about the middle of the 17th century. The streets already mentioned,
    with the Upper and Nether Kirkgate, were all that the town consisted of till after
    the period of the Reformation. The others are comparatively of modern erection.
    Queen-Street, North-Street, the houses on the Quay, Marischal-Street, Belmont-Street,
    and the suburb of Gilcomston, were built during the latter part of the last century.
    The greater part of Footdee, and almost all the other streets, have been erected

    in the city of Aberdeen since the year 1800 are truly astonishing. Many old houses,
    which were of wood, have been taken down, and replaced by handsome structures
    of stone. Three spacious approaches to the town have been formed, and carried
    in direct lines to the very centre of the city, by means of which the inconveniences
    of the old, narrow, and circuitous routes are now entirely avoided. That from
    the north-west by Geoi-ge-Street is spacious and regular. The approach from the
    north-east by King-Street is handsome, and even elegant. The grand approaches,
    however, from the south and west particularly attract the notice of the stranger.
    These meet at Union-Place, and are conducted thence in a straight line through
    Union-Street to the Cross. This street is carried over others by three bridges,
    one of which can boast of an arch 132 feet span, the largest and finest in Scotland.
    At the distance of two miles, in each direction from the Cross, there are bridges
    over the rivers Dee and Don. The bridge of Don consists of a single Gothic arch,
    67 feet span, and is romantically situated between two projecting rocks which
    here confine the channel of the river. It was founded about the close of the 13th
    century, and the expence is said to have been defrayed by Bishop Cheyne, who then
    held the see of Aberdeen. The bridge of Dee was projected by the munificent Bishop
    Elphinston, the founder of King''s College, and was finished by his successor
    Bishop Dunbar in the year 1520. It is a handsome and substantial structure of
    seven semi-circular arches. Attached to each of these bridges, there was a chapel
    in the days of popery. Amongst the many improvements connected with the city of

    the only quay was a small piece of artificial work near the Shore-brae and adjoining
    to Shiprow. In the year 1623 it was extended thence to Footdee, by which a considerable
    part of the basin was cut off, and converted into building ground. About twelve
    years ago, the quay was extended much farther down the channel, with the view
    of joining it to the pier at the mouth of the river. This pier, at the entrance
    to the harbour, was begun in the year 1755, and twenty years after was extended
    1200 feetinto the ocean. Another addition to it of 900 feet was made about ten
    years ago ; and the work, a most magnificent one, is now completed in that quarter.
    The object of this great undertaking was to prevent the mouth of the river from
    being filled with sand, which it formerly was, during the prevalence of storms
    from the north-east. A breakwater from the southern shore, of about 800 feet in
    length, has also been constructed, for the purpose of contracting and deepening
    the channel, and of protecting the entrance of the harbour from south-easterly
    storms. It is in contemplation, agreeably to the plan according to which these
    works have been constructed, to convert the whole of the interior of the harbour
    into a wet-dock, with flood-gates at the entrance, and the ground on the opposite
    side into sites for warehouses. In connection with these details of the progressive
    extension and improvement of Abebdeen, it will be satisfactory to ascertain the
    population of the city at different periods of its history. The earliest existing
    document which can throw light on this question, is a list of

    St Machar consists of one church and one chapel of ease, the cure of which is
    served by three ministers, whose stipends may be estimated at L.340, L.300, and
    L.200 per annum. These places of worship are capable of seating 12,000 persons;
    but this accommodation is far from being adequate to the population belonging
    to the established church. Dissenters of almost every description are to be found
    in Aberdeen ; but some of their places of worship are extremely small. The Dissenting
    Meetinghouses are as follows, viz. one Roman Catholic, two Scotch and one English
    Episcopal ; five Secession, three Congregational, one Relief, one Methodist, one
    Baptist, one Quaker, one Glassite, one Berean, and one non-descript. Besides these,
    there is a Seaman's chapel, where divine service is performed by the ministers
    of several religious denominations alternately. In ancient times there were many
    religious institutions in Aberdeen attached to the Romish hierarchy. The Old Town
    was the see of a Bishop, whose seat was transferred thither from Mortlach in the
    year 1136. Some of the Bishops were distinguished men, of whom Bishop Elphinston,
    the founder of King's College and University, in the Popish church, and Bishops
    Forbes and Scougal, in the days of Protestant Episcopacy, stand pre-eminent. There
    were, in all, 27 Popish and nine Protestant prelates. Previous to the Reformation

    Aberdeen enjoys a great advantage above most of the provincial towns of Scotland
    by means of herhterary institutions. The most important of these are the Universities
    of King''s and Marischal Colleges. King''s College, which is situated in the Old
    Town, is the most ancient of the two. It was founded by Bishop Elphinston in the
    year 1494, in virtue of a bull from Pope Alexander VI. which was confirmed by
    King James IV. in 1497. The establishment consists, at present, of a Principal,
    SubPrincipal, and Professors of Divinity, Civil Law, Medicine, Oriental Languages,
    Humanity, Greek, Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, and Moral Philosophy : Lectures
    are also delivered on Chemistry and Natural History. A Chaplaincy has also been
    recently instituted, with the sanction of the General Assembly of the National
    Church. Marischal College was founded in the year 1593, by George Earl Marischal,
    and obtained almost immediately the sanction of the King and the Church. It is
    endowed for a Principal and Professors of Divinity, Oriental Languages, Greek,
    Mathematics, Natural and Civil History, Natural Philosophy, Moral Philosophy,
    and Logic, Medicine, and Chemistry. Latin is also taught ; and Lectures are delivered
    on Law, and on several branches of Medical Science which are not strictly connected
    with the duties of the Professor of Medicine. Each of the colleges is governed
    by a Chancellor and Hector, the former chosen by the professors, and the latter
    by the students. The number of students attending both is upwards of 600. In each
    of the colleges there is an extensive library, containing many valuable'

    by no means extensive ; but in Marischal College there is an uncommonly fine apparatus
    connected with the Natural Philosophy department. For the support of students
    whose circumstances are moderate, there are many bursaries, some of them of considerable
    value. There is a grammar school, both in the Old and New Town ; the latter is
    endowed for a rector and three masters ; and both are attended by about 300 boys.
    Besides these, there are other seminaries devoted to the instruction of youth
    in almost every branch of useful, scientific, or elegant education. Several of
    these have permanent endowments, whilst others depend for subsistence merely on
    the taste of the public for the several departments of knowledge which they embrace.
    There are many charitable or benevolent institutions in the city. The most prominent
    of these are the Poor's Hospital, the Infirmary, the Lunatic Asylum, Gordon's
    Hospital for the maintenance and education of the sons of decayed burgesses and
    tradesmen ; the Bishop's Hospital, from the funds of which eighteen old men are
    supported ; and Mitchell's Hospital, for maintaining five widows, and five unmarried
    daughters, of burgesses of Old Aberdeen. There are also several foundations for
    charity schools ; and, besides, there are numerous voluntary associations for
    charitable purposes, both of a secular and religious nature. The city of Aberdeen
    has long been a place of considerable trade. Five or six centuries ago, the curing
    and exporting of fish appears to have been a flourishing article of commerce ;

    was carried on with the Low Countries, when woollen stockings were manufactured
    in great quantities for sale in Holland. This branch of commerce only ceased on
    the subjugation of the Netherlands by the French. In the year 1766, the Aberdeen
    Banking Company was established, which was productive of the most material advantage
    to the commerce of the place ; besides this, there are now two other banking establishments
    in the city, and two branches of banks from the metropolis. There are, at present,
    extensive woollen, linen, and cotton manufactories in the town and neighbourhood,
    which give employment to several thousand persons ; there are also establishments
    for the manufacture of tape, sail-cloth, carpets, paper, and pins ; several large
    breweries for ale and porter ; a nail manufactory, coach-works, brick-works, and
    founderies. The trade of ship-building is also carried on to a considerable extent
    ; and the number of vessels belonging to the harbour has of late greatly increased.
    In the year 1814 there were connected with the town, exclusive of the adjoining
    creeks, 160 ships, making 23,400 tons register, and employing 1,280 men ; at present
    there are about 240^ships, making 37,000 tons, and employing 2000 men. Of these,
    14 vessels are engaged in the whale-fishery, with about 50 men to each. The trade
    in fish, for which the town was celebrated in ancient times, is still carried
    on. Findon-haddocks, so called from a village in the neighbourhood where they
    are cured, are regularly exported to Edinburgh and Glasgow, and many other places,
    where they are esteemed a great delicacy. Salmon are also caught in great abundance
    in the rivers

    London market. Another lucrative branch of commerce is the exporting of stones
    from the granite quarries which abound in the vicinity ; the streets of the metropolis
    are paved with this durable substance ; and one of the finest bridges over the
    Thames has been constructed of the same material. Several of the public buildings
    in Aberdeen are worthy of notice. Of the churches, the most venerable is the parish
    church of St Machar, which was formerly the cathedral. All that now remains is
    the nave, surmounted with two spires at the west end. The roof, which is of oak,
    finely blazoned with coats of arms and inscriptions, is justly admired. The central
    tower, which stood at the east end of the present building, fell about the close
    of the 17th century, and buried the transept and the choir in its ruins. The two
    parish churches of St Nicholas are adjoining to each other, being separated only
    by a cross aisle, over which is a tower and pyramidal spire 140 feet in height.
    The East church is a plain Norman building, divided, like the church of St Machar,
    by two rows of pillars surmounted with pointed arches. The West church was founded
    about 70 years ago on the site of a fine old Gothic structure which had gone to
    ruin a short time before. It is a handsome structure in the modern Roman style,
    divided by two rows of piers, over which are semicircular arches. Here the magistrates
    have a gallery, and the seat of the chief magistrate is adorned with an elegant
    mahogany canopy. The wall behind is enriched with several scripture pieces on
    tapestry, executed by a native of the city. None of the other churches or chapels
    on the establishment are remarkable.

    Hall is in the purest Grecian style, ornamented with a portico of the Ionic order.
    A similar, though larger portico, gives a fine appearance to the New Assembly

    The only other buildings calculated to attract notice are the bridges already
    mentioned, the Barracks, Trades' 1 Hall, and Lunatic Asylum. Abekdeen is one of
    the most ancient royal boroughs in Scotland. Before civic corporations were known
    in this country, King Gregory bestowed several special marks of royal favour on
    the inhabitants. The most ancient charter extant is from King William the Lion,
    in which he grants to his burgesses of Aberdeen the free enjoyment of their merchandise,
    after the manner in which their ancestors had exercised in the time of Malcolm
    his grandfather. He gave two other charters, by which the burgesses were exempted
    from paying tolls and customs in any market or fair within the kingdom ; and at
    the same time established a mint, and erected a palace, in the Town. The constitution
    of the burgh was originally vested in an alderman and four bailies, with a common-council,
    elected with the consent and assent of the community assembled in the Guild Court.
    In the middle of the 15th century, an act of Parliament was passed ordaining the
    old council annually to choose the new. The spirit of this enactment has obtained
    ever since, although it has frequently excited opposition and complaint. At present,
    the magistrates and council consist of nineteen persons, fifteen of whom must
    vacate their seats at the end of the year. The office-bearers are

    ten merchant councillors, and two tradescouncillors. The Provost is high-sheriff
    and coroner, and the Bailies his deputy-sheriffs and coroners within the city
    and liberties. The Dean of Guild, besides having the power of marking and stamping
    all weights and measures, is custodier of the standard weights and measures, not
    only within the city but also of the whole county of Aberdeen. In the burgh there
    are seven incorporated trades, viz. Hammermen, Bakers, Wrights, and Coopers, Tailors,
    Shoemakers, Weavers, and Fleshers. A deacon, chosen annually, presides over each,
    and a deacon-convener over the whole. The paving, cleaning, and lighting of the
    streets of the city, and the supplying of the town with water, is under the superintendance
    of commissioners of police, chosen annually by the inhabitants agreeably to an
    act of Parliament. The expence is defrayed by assessment on the house-rents within
    the burgh. A regular nightwatch has lately been added to the establishment. The
    whole has been productive of the greatest advantage to the public. Our limits
    will not admit of much historical detail respecting the events which have distinguished
    the city at different periods. In addition to what has been stated, it may be
    observed, that Aberdeen was frequently a royal residence, not only in the time
    of William the Lion but also in that of the Alexanders. In the years 1244 and
    1264, the town was destroyed by accidental fire. In 1292 the castle was delivered
    up to Baliol, and garrisoned by English troops, who afterwards plundered and burnt
    the town on. the approach of Sir William Wallace.

  clean_text: 17 The citizens of Aberdeen were amongst the first that joined the standard
    of KingRobert Bruce. They defeated a body of English near Inverness, and soon
    after took the castle by storm, and put the garrison to the sword. In the year
    1336, the town was again pillaged by the English, and, being set on fire, burned
    for six days, till the whole was reduced to ashes. King David, on his return from
    France, assisted the citizens to rebuild these houses, and held his first Parliament
    in the town in the year 1343. Robert II. the first of the Stuarts, occasionally
    made Aberdeen his residence. In the beginning of the fifteenth century, the citizens
    marched out in battle array to oppose the Highland army under Donald the Lord
    of the Isles, when most of the principal burgesses, with the provost, were slain.
    During this century bloody conflicts often took place on the streets, and the
    citizens were frequently at war with the turbulent clans in the neighbourhood.
    At the period of the Reformation, in the year 1560, the monasteries of the city
    were destroyed ; and the interior furnishing of the choir of the cathedral, with
    the lead on its roof, as well as the altars in the church of St Nicholas, were
    removed. During the troubles in the reign of Charles I. the inhabitants at first
    manifested a disposition to oppose the covenant, which was then subscribed by
    almost all the nobility, clergy, magistrates, and people of Scotland ; but the
    majority afterwards acceeded to this celebrated bond. Amidst the many conflicts
    which followed at this period the town suffered severely. The inhabitants were
    repeatedly pillaged, the funds of the corporation were exhausted, and the ravages
    of the plague completed the work of devastation by carrying off 2000 persons.

    being ejected from their livings, became Episcopalian dissenters. During the rebellions
    of 1715 and 1745, the great majority of the citizens, being Presbyterians, were
    faithful to the established government. The town was occupied by the rebels at
    both these periods, but no very daring acts of outrage were committed. On both
    occasions, however, the regular election of magistrates was prevented. The history
    of the city since that time is chiefly a detail of its progressive improvement.
    The magnificent plans for altering and ornamenting the town were unfortunately,
    a few years ago, the means of embarrassing the funds of the corporation ; and,
    in the year 1817, owing to an irregularity in the annual election of the magistrates
    and council, the sett of the burgh was forfeited. The old council, however, were
    authorized soon after, by a warrant from the Government, to elect a new ; and,
    during the few years that have elapsed since that period, the prosperity of the
    corporation has revived, and the funds of the city are once more in a flourishing
    condition. Printed by John Moir, Edinburgh, 1825.

    and was granted with the territory of Annandale and Lochmaben to the ancestors
    of Robert Bruce, by some of whom a castle was built. This castle was in later
    times occupied as a church, but having become a ruin it was deserted, and the
    original wall now forms part of the jail of Annan. By the accession of the Bruce
    family to the throne it became a Royal Burgh. Upon the death of David the the
    Second in 1371, this castle, Lochmaben, and the Lordship of Annandale came to
    Randolph Earl of Murray, who was regent during the minority of David, and, with
    his sister Agnes, it went to the Dunbars Earls of March. After their forfeiture
    it went to the Douglasses. The Douglasses also lost it by joining with the Duke
    of Albany, brother of James the Third, who had revolted against the King, and
    plundered the Fair of Lochmaben with 500 horsemen on St. Magdalen's day, 22d July
    1483, where they were defeated, when Douglas was taken prisoner, and Albany fled
    to England. After this period it remained in the hands of the King, and became
    the great key of the Western Border. It now belongs to the Earl of Hopetoun, and
    is a Marquisate in the family of Johnstone. The parish of Annan is about eight
    miles in length, and from one to three miles in breadth. The surface is mostly
    level, and the soil in general a rich clay. Potatoes are much cultivated here,
    which are of an excellent quality, and in great request for seed. The river Annan
    intersects the parish, whose banks are ornamented with belts of planting, as are
    also most of the elevated grounds. There is a valu-

  clean_text: ARBROATH. Aberbrothock, commonly called Arbroath, is a Royal Burgh in
    the county of Angus or Forfar, it is distant 17 miles from Dundee, 12 from Montrose,
    and 14 from Forfar the county town. Its name is descriptive of its situation,
    where the Brothock, a small stream, said to signify " the muddy water," discharges
    itself into the ocean. The town, which is now a thriving seat both of commerce
    and manufactures, was celebrated at a former period for its stately and richly
    endowed Abbey, founded about the year 1178 by King William the Lion, and dedicated
    to Thomas a Becket of Canterbury, who was then esteemed a saint and martyr. The
    ground occupied by the Abbey and its adjoining garden was enclosed with a strong
    wall ; the length from north to south being 1150 feet, the breadth on the north
    side of the area 706, and on the south 484. The height of this wall was from 20
    to 24 feet, with battlements at intervals. The tower at the north-west corner,
    which formed the regality prison, is still entire, being about 24 feet

    east end, stands the Charter house, in a state pretty entire, consisting of two
    vaulted apartments, the one over the other. The foundations of the cloisters may
    still be traced in the convent church-yard. Little is known respecting the early
    state of the town of Arbroath, as the records of the burgh were lost about the
    beginning of the last century. It is only, however, since the year 1760 that it
    began materially to increase in extent and population. About this period the town
    consisted only of the High Street, Market gate, Old Shore-head, Applegate, and
    Lordburn. There were no houses on the Abbey grounds, where fore and back Abbey
    Streets are now situated. There were no suburbs in the parish of St. Vigeans,
    nor were the streets within the royalty west of the Brothock then built. The first
    indication of any trade or commerce being carried on at Arbroath subsequent to
    the charter granted by King John of England in 1304*, may be dated from the year
    1304, when an agreement was made between John Geddy, abbot at the time, and the
    Burgesses of the Town, binding himself and his successors in office to bear the
    greater share of the expense of building and maintaining a harbour, which vessels
    might enter, and where they might lay in safety, in consideration of a certain
    yearly duty to be paid by the townsmen out of every rood of land within the burgh.
    In 1725 the old harbour, which was situated at the foot of the High Street, was
    abandoned, and a new one constructed on the west side of the Brothock. Though
    small for the present state of the trade connected with it,

    artificial, and cased with stone work, having an outlet to the sea 31 feet in
    width. This entrance can be shut at any time against the violence of the waves,
    by means of wooden beams fitted to a groove, into which they are let down at pleasure.
    The number of vessels belonging to the harbour in the year 1780 did not exceed
    18, measuring about 900 tons. In the year 1792 they amounted to 23 vessels, 1704
    tons, at present (1827) the number of vessels is 67, registering 5628 tons. The
    principal foreign trade is to the Baltic, from which Flax is imported. This is
    spun into yarn at several mills in the town and neighbourhood, whose machinery
    is driven by steam. Three of these are extensive works, and give employment to
    many hands. The original manufacture carried on in the town was that of Osnaburgh
    linens, established before the middle of last century. This has since given place
    to the manufacture of dowlas, sheetings, shirtings, and sail cloth. Besides the
    parish church there are two chapels of ease belonging to the Establishment, and
    dissenting meeting houses in connexion with the Secession, Episcopalians, Methodists,
    Glassites, Congregational Independents, and Bereans. The literary establishments
    of the town consist of an Academy, having a rector, and three other teachers.
    The branches taught are the Latin, French, and English languages, with mathematics,
    arithmetic, and writing. There are also many private schools, in which the common
    branches of education are taught.

    sixty paupers, though there is seldom so many. This establishment is chiefly supported
    by its own funds, arising from lands and donations, or from what is called in
    Scotland, mortifications. The Dispensary, supported by subscriptions, gives medicine
    and aid to the sick poor. The Sailors Society instituted in 1581, support their
    own distressed members. The Merchant Society was formed in 1655, with a fund for
    the support of decayed members, their widows and orphans. The Ayr Universal Society,
    and many other charitable and benevolent institutions, on a smaller scale, are
    ably conducted. It was in the town of Ayr that the heroic Sir William Wallace,
    the protector of Scotland, first commenced his opposition to the English under
    Edward the first, and here that monarch established one of his most powerful garrisons.
    It is noted also, as being the birth place of Johannes Scotus, surnamed Erigena,
    who flourished in the ninth century ; celebrated throughout Europe for his learning,
    ready wit, and powerful elocution, exerted in the metaphysical disputations of
    his time. This town also gave birth to the Chevalier Ramsay, author of the travels
    of Cyrus, and other works. The more modern, but no less celebrated Robert Burns,
    the Scotch Poet, was born at Alloway in this neighbourhood, in a small cottage,
    now a public house, where the apartment in which he was born is shewn ; and near

    " Tam o' Shanter." The harbour of Ayr is formed by the river Ayr at its influx
    into the estuary of the Firth of Clyde, on the north side of the town. The entrance
    was formerly much incommoded by a bar of sand being frequently formed across its
    mouth, by a north west wind, and having only twelve feet of water at spring tides.
    These inconveniences are now removed, and the harbour greatly improved, by carrying
    out an extensive stone pier into the sea, which gives an additional depth of water,
    for vessels entering the harbour ; and superior accommodation whilst within it.
    The harbour of Ayr is now preferable to any of its size on this coast, and when
    other contemplated improvements are completed, will greatly increase the mercantile
    importance of the town of Ayr. The whole of Ayrshire abounds with inexhaustible
    Seams of Coal, Freestone, Limestone, Ironstone, and with several rich ores of
    Lead and Copper. None of these minerals, except Coal and Freestone, are in the
    immediate neighbourhood of the town ; but their proximity to Ayr, the principal
    seaport in the County, is an important advantage to the shipping interest of the
    town. Large quantities of grain are also shipped from the port of Ayr. From the
    low and level situation of the town on the shores of the Clyde the air is in general
    moist. This level tract of sandy soil, extends for more than a mile to the south
    and north of the town, affording to the Inhabitants the most commodious walks
    and rides, and extensive links or downs for the exercise of the favourite Scotch

    \ Scotland, situated on the north, or Scottish side of the river Tweed. It is\
    \ a town of very considerable importance, and is distant from Edinburgh, south-east,\
    \ 53 miles,\u2014 15 miles east of Dunse,\u2014 22-i north-east from Kelso,\u2014\
    63 miles north by west of Newcastle, and 340 north by west of London. Longitude\
    \ 1\xB058' west, Latitude 55\xB045' north. Berwick was originally a Scotch town,\
    \ formerly the capital of Merse, or March ; but became subject to England finally\
    \ in the reign of Edward the Fourth. Though under the jurisdiction of the Supreme\
    \ Courts in England in most matters, yet in others it has an exclusive jurisdiction\
    \ and has some peculiar customs and privileges. A small district called Berwick\
    \ Bounds, running about three miles north from the town on the sea shore, about\
    \ the same distance up the Tweed, and a line drawn from these two extremeties\
    \ on the north west, is the extent of these * Bounds,' attached to the town."

  clean_text: 56 At the lower end of the south, or Nether Tenements, is a stone bridge
    of two large arches over the South Esk. The town had many years ago been walled
    round, as the names of South, West, and North Ports, still indicate. It was twice
    destroyed by fire, by the Danes in the year 1012, and again by the Marquis of
    Montrose, in 164-5. A bishop's see was founded here by David the First in 114-0,
    richly endowed. That part of the cathedral which still remains, is an ancient
    Gothic pile, supported by twelve pillars, and having a door and window in the
    west end, of curious and beautiful workmanship. When entire it was 166 feet long,
    and 61 feet broad. At the north-west corner is a square tower, with a handsome
    spire, together 120 feet high. The present parish church, occupies the west end
    of the cathedral, which was some time ago repaired at very considerable exper.ce,
    and makes an elegant place of worship. Adjoining to the church on the south-west,
    is one of those round towers, of which this and another at Abernethy, are all
    that remain in Scotland. Antiquarians have long been divided in their opinions,
    concerning the time when these towers were erected, and their use. One conjecture
    is, that they were watch towers, several suppose them to have been belfries, whence
    the criers summoned the people to prayers, while not a few, knowing that similar
    towers are to be found in Ireland, named the land of sanctity, think that they
    must have been places in which penitents were confined till restored to the bosom
    of the church. This tower contains four openings or windows at the top, directed
    to the four cardinal points, and commands a tol-

    and part of the valley of Strathearn, and this at Brechin is directed towards
    the great valley of Strath more. The conjecture that these were watch-towers,
    is but ill supported, the view from the tower of Brechin is very limited, extending
    only to Montrose on the east, and a short way into the valley of Strathmore, neither
    is the view from the tower at Abernethy very extensive. The tower at Brechin is
    a circular column of great beauty and elegance, 80 feet high, with a kind of spire
    or roof 23 feet additional, of an octagonal form, making the whole height 103
    feet, the diameter at the base is 1 6 feet. The building consists of 86 courses
    of stone, not regular in their depth, some of them measuring 24, some of them
    only 9 inches, and the stones somewhat deeper at one end than the other, so that
    the courses bear some resemblance to a screw. This fabric has sustained little
    injury from time. The door is about 6 feet from the ground, 22 inches wide, and
    6tj feet high, the sides are formed of large blocks of the same sand stone, of
    which the rest of the tower is built. Nearly in the centre of each stands a human
    figure on a kind of bracket, supposed to be one of the apostles, having a rod
    or staff in his hand. The lintel is another block of sand stone cut into a semicircular
    arch, over the centre of which, stands the figure of our Saviour stretched on
    the Cross, whence has arisen the probable conjecture' that this tower was built
    after Christianity had been introduced into Scotland. The sole is another block
    of the same kind of stone, on each end of which are the figures of two animals,
    conjectured to be a lion and a lamb, the whole entrance is

    figures described. In a lane at the upper part of the town, are some remains of
    the chapel of Maison Dieu, an hospital founded by William de Brechin, and confirmed
    by James the Third in 1477, part of the revenues of which are still applied by
    the magistrates^its patrons, towards the support of the poor, and part to pay
    the salary of the master of the grammer school, called Preceptor of Maison Dieu.
    Near to the town stands Brechin Castle, the ancient seat of the family of Panmure,
    and residence of the honourable William Ramsay Maule. It was built in 1711, on
    the brink of a perpendicular rock overhanging the South Esk, and erected on the
    site of the old castle which sustained a siege of 20 days, in the year 1303, by
    the English army under Edward the First. Notwithstanding every effort used to
    compel the besieged to surrender, the brave governor, Sir Thomas Maule, held out
    till he was killedjjy a stone thrown from an engine, when the place was instantly
    given up. A descendant of this brave man was, in 1616, created Lord Maule of Brechin,
    and Earl of Panmure. The estates and title were attainted in 1715. While the property
    is again in possession of the family, the Peerage has not yet been restored. Brechin
    is governed by a provost, two bailies, a dean of guild, treasurer, hospital master,
    convenor of trades, a trades councillor, and five ordinary councillors. It has
    six incorporated trades, and joins with Aberdeen, Aberbro thick, Montrose, and

    Dieu, of which the crown is patron, another for the parochial school under the
    patronage of the heritors and magistrates, and the third for the mathematical

    Two works have long since been established here, in which yarn is bleached on
    chemical principles, and these are carried on with such activity, that 10,000
    lbs. are whitened at each, in the course of a week. Streams from the South Esk
    turn, at the lower extremity of the town, two mills for spinning linen yarn, one
    of which contains 16 frames, and the other 26, besides flour and other mills.
    One distillery of considerable extent, established here, has attracted notice,
    by the superior quality of its whisky, and operations are about to be commenced
    in another. A porter brewery is also carried on here with success, and a tannage
    ; but the business which occupies far the the greater part of the working classes

    \ to a modern guinea, and in value to 5s. 3d. Sterling, were found deposited in\
    \ a niche of the wall about six feet from the ground. These curious relics of\
    \ the olden time came into the possession of some of the neighbouring gentry,\

    \ the Earldom was forfeited to the Crown, in 1320, by the treason of its heiress,\
    \ Joanna, daughter of Malise, the last Earl. This lady married the English Earl\
    \ de Warren. The office of Steward afterwards became vested in the House of Drummond,\
    \ who enjoyed it until the abolition of heritable jurisdictions in the year 174S.\

    of books from the Honourable Baron Sii Patrick Murray, Bart, of Ochtertyre, and
    since that time enlarged and supported by subscription. There is also a Coffee-room
    for newspapers and reviews. Mallet the poet, and Dow the historian of Hindostan,
    according to popular tradition, were educated at the school of Crieff. The late
    Dr. William Wright, an eminent physician and naturalist, and Dr. Thomas Thomson,
    one of the living ornaments of science who now occupies a chair in the University
    of Glasgow, were natives of Crieff. The late Dr. John Barclay, the celebrated
    anatomist, though not a native of this town, passed his youth in its vicinity.
    A weekly market is held every Thursday, and a number of general fairs take place
    during the course of the year. The population of the whole parish in 1776 was
    1977 ; in 1792 it was 2640 ; in 1811 it was 3300 ; in 1821 it was 4216 ; and in

  clean_text: CUPAR OF FIFE. Cupar is a Royal Burgh, and the County Town of Fifeshire.
    It is 22 miles north-east of Kinghorn, 10 west of St. Andrews, 12 south-west of
    Newport on Tay, 10 east from Falkland, and 30 miles from Edinburgh. It is delightfully
    situated on a plain, having a dry soil, and southern exposure on the banks of
    the river Eden, at its junction with a small stream called the Lady-burn. Cupar
    is 6 miles from Gairbridge, the nearest shipping place on the Eden ; and 9 miles
    from the junction of the river with St. Andrews Bay. Cupar is a burgh of very
    great antiquity, having been from the most remote period the place where the Thanes
    of Fife held their Courts of Justice. The names of commissioners from Cupar are
    found in the Rolls of Parliament in the reign of David II. The Castle of Cupar
    is frequently mentioned in history as a place of strength and of great importance
    in troublesome times, but no vestige of it now remains. Its site is occupied by
    a school house, and a small Theatre ; so that

    \ and the deeds of the mighty, is now become the peaceful seat of learning, and\
    \ the scene of scaithless encounters ! On the Play Field, adjacent to the Castle\
    \ Hill, the plays of Sir David Lindsay of the Mount were exhibited. The ' Satyr\
    \ of the three Estates,' was acted here in the year 1555. From a manuscript play\
    \ of Sir David Lindsay, in the possession of David Garrick, it appears that the\
    \ Playfield of Cupar in Fife was well known and frequented, and had been in use\
    \ long previous to this period,\u2014indeed few towns of note in Scotland were\
    \ without them. The play of the Satyr of the three Estates is what may be considered\
    \ as the origin of the Scottish Drama, or, of those plays called Moralities, which\
    \ were then first divided into acts and scenes, though representations of what\
    \ were called Mysteries, or holy plays, were exhibited by the Clergy in Scotland\
    \ long before this date. From the low situation of the town of Cupar, it is not\
    \ seen at a distance ; it is seen from the east, but the point of view form whence\
    \ it is seen to the greatest advantage is the north-west. The Streets are broad\
    \ and spacious, and contain many elegant houses. The principal streets are the\
    \ Bonnygate, the Millgate, or Waulker gate, the Crossgate, and St. Catherines.\
    \ The latter is a new and elegant street, in a line with the Bonnygate ; in this\
    \ street is situated the County Hall and Public Rooms, and an Inn of very superior\
    \ architecture, affording every accommodation to the traveller. This street, particularly,\
    \ may vie with some of the best streets in the metropolis."

  clean_text: 71 The Grammar School of Dalkeith has long maintained a very high character
    for the abilities of its teachers, and many of the brightest ornaments of literature
    have here received the rudiments of their education. Besides the grammar school,
    there is a school conducted on the new system, for the education of children of
    both sexes, a large charity work house, or town's hospital, for the maintenance
    of the indigent belonging to the town, and several other benevolent institutions.
    There are several excellent inns in the town, a ball room elegantly fitted up,
    a mason lodge, &c. The rivers furnish numerous falls of water for driving machinery
    on their banks, and these falls are occupied by corn, flour, and snuff mills,
    skinneries, &c. in the immediate vicinity of the town. An iron mill and bleachfields
    are in the neighbourhood. Dalkeith is a burgh of barony, and gives the title of
    Earl to the eldest son of the Duke of Buccleuch. The only magistrate is the Baron
    bailie, appointed by his Grace. The town as to its police revenue, is under the
    management of 15 trustees, (including the Baron bailie, who is considered preses)
    appointed by Act of Parliament. This act gives two pennies Scots on every Scots
    pint of ale or beer, brewed for sale, or vended within the town and parish, the
    monies arising from this ; the sweepings of the streets, and some small property
    ; is the only revenue of the town, which is small, yet by judicious management,
    much public good has been done. The Inhabitants are not burdened with any town's
    assessments, except the impost on beer as above mentioned. The town is about to
    be lighted with

    \ rapidly. Dalkeith is an elegant and gay town, and the summer resort of parties\
    \ of pleasure from the capital, drawn hither by the enchanting beauty of the scenery,\
    \ as well as by the excellent accommodation afforded to visitants. From Edinburgh\
    \ to Dalkeith, by the villages of Roslin and Lasswade, forms one of the most pleasant,\
    \ picturesque, and delightful tours in the neighbourhood of the capital. Dalkeith\
    \ is one of the first markets for grain in Scotland. Monday is the market day\
    \ for meal and flour, Thursday for grain. Very large quantities of oats are sold\
    \ every market day, brought from the south country, viz. the upper part of Berwickshire,\
    \ East Lothian, and Teviotdale. Of the grain at market, it is not uncommon for\
    \ the sales to amount to 5000 bolls on a market day, and may average S00O bolls\
    \ per week, through the year, when the country produces a fair crop. This large\
    \ quantity is all disposed of in a limited time, and for ready money, a matter\
    \ of great importance to the farmer. On the ringing of the market bell, the sacks\
    \ are opened, the carts as they arrive are placed in regular order on the High\
    \ Street, or market place, and the sample sacks having been all ranged in rows,\
    \ the bell rings at 12 o'Clock, and all is instantly bustle and activity\u2014\

  clean_text: 73 Dalkeith contains a few thriving manufactories, but cannot be considered
    a manufacturing town. The established manufactures, are those of leather, candles,
    soap and hats, but the chief support of the town is its markets, and trade with
    the surrounding country. Adjoining to the town, is Dalkeith House, the principal
    seat of the Duke of Buccleuch, on the southern bank of the north Esk. This elegant
    and extensive building was erected about the beginning of the last century, by
    the family of Scott, upon the site of an ancient castle which had been long in
    the possession of the Douglas family, and was afterwards the frequent residence
    of the Regent Morton, during the minority of James the Sixth, at which time it
    was significantly called the " Lion's den." This edifice consists of a main body
    and two wings, with ornaments of the Corinthian order in front. The hall, the
    grand stair case, and the several suits of rooms are large, and finished in the
    highest stile of elegance ; superbly furnished, and contain a fine collection
    of valuable paintings. The beauties of the situation are much heightened by the
    serpentine windings of the two rivers, which form a junction about half a mile
    below the House. The banks of both rivers are beautified by natural woods, and
    most romantic scenery, and art has added extensive walks, laid out with great
    taste. Within view of the house there is an elegant bridge of polished freestone,
    built within these few years as an ornament to the grounds, a cascade at this
    spot has a fine effect. The park, which is amongst the largest in the country,
    containing 800 Scotch, or 1000 English Acres,

  clean_text: DINGWALL. Dingwall is a Royal Burgh in the parish of that name, and
    County of Ross. It is 23 miles north by west of Inverness, 26 south-west of Tain,
    20 south-west of Cromarty, 10 north of Beauly, and 178 miles N. N. west of Edinburgh.
    The town is pleasantly situated on a fertile plain at the west end of the Firth
    of Cromarty, which is navigable for small vessels as far up as the town. It appears
    that the town of Dingwall was anciently much more extensive than at present, causeways
    and foundations of houses have been found some hundred yards distant from the
    present site of the town. The name was formerly Dingnaval, expressive of the richness
    of the soil of the low grounds. It was erected into a Royal Burgh by Alexander
    the Second in the year 1226, which erection and privileges were confirmed by a
    charter granted in the reign of James the Fourth. By these charters Dingwall is
    entitled ' to all the privileges, liberties, and immunities possessed by the burgh
    of Inverness.'

    the buildings are substantial, and many of them handsome. It is well situated
    for trade, but hitherto no particular branch of manufacture has been introduced.
    The municipal government of the town is vested in a provost, two hailies, a dean
    of Guild, treasurer, and 10 councillors ; and it joins with Tain, Dornoch, Wick,
    and Kirkwall, in sending a member to Parliament. Near the town are the ruins of
    the Castle of Dingwall, the ancient residence of the Earls of Ross. It has been
    a regular fortification, surrounded by a deep ditch and glacis, where not defended
    by the sea, and stands close upon the shore. The Earl of Ross was the most powerful
    of the Scottish Barons, and proprietor of a great part of this country, previous
    to the forfeiture of the last Earl. Many of the ancient families in Ross-shire
    held their estates from him by charters dated, ' apud castrum nostrum de Dingwall.'
    Near the church is an Obelisk which was erected by George, first Earl of Cromarty,
    Secretary of State for Scotland in the reign of Queen Anne. It stands upon an
    artificial mount, the bottom of which covers about two-thirds of an English acre.
    It is only six feet square at the base, and rises in a pyramidal form to the height
    of 57 feet. It was erected to distinguish the burying place of the family. A Mineral
    Spa, similar to that of Harrowgate, is situated about four miles to the west of
    the town. Dingwall is a post town, and the neighbourhood is ornamented by a number
    of beautiful mansions. It has a good parish school, two English academies, and

    \ an inundation of the rivers Clyde and Leveri. In that year the King and Parliament\
    \ granted to Dunbarton, 37,000 merks Scotch, for raising bulwarks to resist any\
    \ future inundations of these two rivers, \u2014but these do not appear to have\
    \ been completed, so as to reclaim the land lost, amounting to nearly 200 acres,\
    \ which is almost overflowed every tide. The ruins of buildings are still discernible.\
    \ The suburbs are connected with the town, near to its west end, by a bridge of\
    \ five arches over the Leven, built by government about 50 years ago ; the centre\
    \ arch is 52 feet span ; the whole length of the bridge being above 300 feet.\
    \ The estuary of the Leven forms a good harbour, where an extensive quay, and\
    \ a capacious dock, has been constructed. The latter is 220 feet long, and 35\
    \ feet broad, and is considered as one of the best docks on the Clyde. There are\
    \ also two building yards, in which about 40 sailing vessels have been built within\
    \ the last three years, of from 45 to 280 tons burden, and 30 steam vessels of\
    \ from 70 to 210 tons register. The Leven is navigable by coasting vessels to\
    \ the town of Dunbarton, and there are nearly 2700 tons of shipping, registered\
    \ and unregistered, belonging to the port. The resident burgesses of Dunbarton\
    \ have the privilege of exemption from all river and harbour dues, payable at\
    \ the port of Glasgow ; by virtue of a contract entered into with that City, and\
    \ ratified by Act of Parliament in the year 1701."

  clean_text: 37 Dundee contains many charitable and benevolent institutions, a detail
    of which our limits forbid us to enter upon. Most of the streets are neat, clean,
    well paved and lighted with gas, and the houses, where they are not elegant, are
    well built and commodious. The Nethergate and Over, or Uppergate, strike off from
    the High Street to the west, and the Murray-gate, and Seagate to the eastward.
    The town is well supplied with water, every street has a public well, conveyed
    to the town in leaden pipes. The situation of the town is most delightful, commanding
    a fine view of the opposite coast of Fife, the passage of the river, with the
    numerous vessels passing up and down the Tay. To the west of the burgh, the environs
    are ornamented by the great number of the residences of the more opulent citizens,
    on the bank of the river. These mansions are in beautiful situations, handsomely
    built, and many of them elegant, and adorned with planting and shrubery. Upon
    the whole this town seems to have a right to its aneient appellation of " Bonny
    Dundee." The town of Dundee has long been famed for its seminaries of education,
    and very early evinced a predilection for literature. The academy is an excellent
    establishment, where the ancient and modern languages, mathematics, natural and
    experimental philosophy, &c. are taught by able masters, the collection of philosophical
    apparatus is extensive. There is a public grammar school, and English schools,
    with many other seminaries for all the useful and ornamental branches of modern
    education.

    There are two stone bridges over the Nith, the lower bridge consists of nine arches,

    and county of Fife. It is situated in the western district of Fife-shire, about
    3 miles from the Firth of Forth, on an eminence rising to 227 feet above the level
    of the sea, and commanding a most extensive, varied, and beautiful prospect. It
    lies 3 miles north of the port of Limekilns, 5 miles south of Charlestown, 6 from
    the North Queensferry, 7 north-east from Culross, 10 south by west of Kinross,
    and 17 miles north-west of Edinburgh. Dunfermline has one principal street, the
    High Street, extending from east to west, and continued westward by Bridge Street,
    and eastward by East Port Street. It runs along the face of the hill, and is crossed
    at right angles hy other streets, in which are many elegant and well built houses.
    The Town House is in Bridge Street and has a spire and clock. The Jail is in the
    same building. Nearly in the centre of the High Street, stands the Guild Hall
    now private property, and occupied as an Inn. It contains assembly rooms, and

  clean_text: DUNKELD. Dunkeld is an ancient burgh of Barony in the united parishes
    of Dunkeld and Dowally, and county of Perth ; charmingly situated on the north
    bank of the river Tay. It is 15 miles north of Perth, 20 south-east of Blair in
    Athol, 12 west of Blairgowrie, and 57 miles north of Edinburgh. The scenery around
    Dunkeld has always been the admiration of visitors. Nature has been profuse in
    producing and combining every object that can form the grand, the picturesque,
    and the beautiful in landscape; and the taste of the noble proprietor has improved
    these beauties to their utmost extent. The scenery in this neighbourhood is nowhere
    surpassed in Scotland. Dunkeld was the capital of ancient Caledonia, and had a
    monastery of Culdees founded in it by a Pictish king, about the dawn of Christianity.
    This monastery was converted into a bishopric by David the First in the year 1130,
    and ranked in his time as the first in the kingdom. The catheO

    into the Old and New Town, communicating by the North Bridge, and Earthen Mound.
    The New Town having been laid out on a regular plan in 17^7* is one of the finest
    cities in Europe. The whole has been built within the last 60 years, of beautiful
    free stone, superior to any in the kingdom. A plan for building, what may be termed

    will be joined to its ancient sea port. Edinburgh being noted for learning and

    of the Pentland Hills, at a distance of five miles on the south, rear their lofty
    summits to the height of 1450, to 1/00 feet above the level of the sea. These
    hills form a magnificent amphitheatre, in which stands the Metropolis of North

    the City, particularly stone and lime of superior quality, have in an eminent
    degree, given a beauty and stability to the edifices of Edinburgh, no where excelled,
    and justifies the appellation bestowed upon it, of the " City of Palaces." From
    the facility afforded by the natural declivities of both Old and New Town, in
    making sewers, and underground works, for carrying off the soil, the former has
    now got free of its old reproach, and the latter is one of the cleanest Cities
    in Europe. In the year 1/53, Edinburgh occupied nearly the same extent of ground
    which it had done for centuries before. Since that period, it has been enlarged
    to three times its bulk. During the last thirty years, particularly the improvements
    both in the Old and New Town, have been astonishing. Streets, Squares, Churches,
    and public edifices, have risen in rapid succession ; old and inconvenient buildings
    have been removed, and replaced by elegant houses ; and the pavements and foot-paths
    improved and renewed. It would be superfluous to attempt a description of all

    or Water of Leith, takes its rise in the Pent] and Hills, and after a course of
    fourteen miles, falls into the Firth of Forth, at Leith, forming the harbour of
    Leith at its junction. This being the only river in the immediate vicinity of
    the metropolis, the natural beauties of its banks, have been increased by the
    erection of numerous elegant seats, and extensive plantations. Short as the course
    of this river is, yet within that distance, it gives motion to the machinery of
    upwards of one hundred mills, in its course to the sea. Besides corn, meal and
    flour, snuff, lint, and spinning mills, there are three large, and four smaller

    web machine, by which three fourths of the former manual labour, is saved in the
    first formation of the sheet. The neighbourhood of Edinburgh, is the chief seat
    of the paper manufacture in Scotland, from whence large quantities are sent to
    the London market. The origin of Edinburgh is lost in the obscurity of ages. The
    etymology, and the early history of the City are involved in equal obscurity ;
    the most probable conjecture, is that which derives the name from the compound
    Gaelic word, Dun-Edin, or Edwinsburgh ; a name by which it is still known in the
    Highlands of Scotland. The Castle of Edinburgh is mentioned in Scottish history,
    as the place where Queen Margaret, widow of Malcolm Canmore, died in the year
    1093. The first traces of Edinburgh as a Town, are found in a charter granted
    by David the First, in 1128, in favour of certain Canons Regular, for whom he
    founded the Abbey of Holyrood-house ; where it is styled Burgo meo de Edwinesburg.
    The first Parliament held here, was in the year 1216. Edward the First having
    carried off, or destroyed the records of the country in 1295, render this period
    of its history dark and uncertain. In the year 1392, Robert the First granted

    Town of Elgin, the hospital of Maison Dieu* formerly a popish establishment ;
    the revenue of which, now goes partly to the support of schools, and partly to
    provide four poor men with a house, garden, gown, and four bolls of barley to
    each. The trade of this burgh is not extensive, being entirely dependant on the
    population of the agricultural district, by which it is every where surrounded.
    One Woollen manufactory, belonging to Mr Johnston (at present, 1827,) ma y D^s

    has lately been opened on the property of the Earl of Fife, in the Quarrelwood,
    near Elgin, by an Aberdeen Company, who propose to send the stone to Edinburgh,
    London, &c. &c. The colour is beautiful, and the surface and grain of the stone,
    is the finest in the island. It rises in vast blocks and masses, some of them
    34 feet long, and four feet square, and slabs have been got 12 feet by 10, and
    six inches thick. From this and the adjoining Quarry, all the stone with which
    the public buildings in Elgin have been erected, and which are so highly and justly
    admired, has been taken ; for ornamental Architecure, there is no stone that we
    are acquainted with, so perfectly adapted. Elgin is pleasantly situated on the
    banks of the Lossie, about five miles above its influx into the Moray Firth. It
    consists of one principal Street^about

    are connected with the new Building. On the North side of the Town is an eminence,
    on which stood the Castle of Forfar, the occasional residence of Malcolm Canmore.
    To mark this spot, the Magistrates several years ago, removed to it the ancient
    Cross of Forfar. The Loch of Forfar lies to the West of the Town ; it is about
    two miles in length, the breadth does not exceed, at any part of it, one fourth

    a high character in the Market ; and this ch> cumstance has contributed to the
    increase of the trade of tbe town. The distance of any sea port, and the price

    of Moray or Elginshire. It lies 12 miles west by south of Elgin, 11 east by north
    of Nairn, 20 miles east of Fort George, 32 north east of Inverness, 90 north west
    of Aberdeen, and 156 north by west of Edinburgh. The situation of the Town is

    abrupt termination being crowned by the ruins of a Castle, from whose Terrace
    the whole of the surrounding country is visible, stretching around in a rich plain,
    bounded by Wooded or fertile banks, above which rise the distant mountains. A
    rivulet, issuing from the woods, near Sanquhar House, winds round two sides of
    the Town. It is crossed by three handsome Stone Bridges, leading from the different

    challenge competition with most buildings in the north of Scotland. Still farther

    Tower is added, will further embellish the Town. There are also two handsome and
    commodious Chapels for the Members of other religious professions. The comfort
    and cleanliness of the place is much improved by means of common sewers r which
    extend under the High Street, and are carried along some of the larger Streets
    or Lanes, which branch from it. It is unceitain when Forres was erected into a
    Royal Burgh, but ancient records mention it as a Town of considerable importance
    so early as the thirteenth century. But before that period, it must have been
    a place of some consequence, since, in the tenth century, King Duffus brought
    robbers, from Ross, and Caithness, to be there executed. The Town is governed
    by a Provost, three Bailies, a Dean of Guild, and eleven other Councillors, making
    in all sixteen. It joins with Fortrose, Nairn and Inverness, in returning a Member
    to Parliament. Besides the Established Church, this Town contains a Meeting House

    under the patronage of the Magistracy for the Education of young Ladies. Some
    years ago, John Anderson, Esquire, late of Glasgow, and a native of a neighbouring
    Parish, (Kinloss,) left considerable funds for building and endowing a School
    for the Education of the children of the poor of the Parishes of Kinloss, Rafford,
    and Forres, This building was finished in 1S24, and is called Anderson's Institution.
    Some legal difficulties have prevented the full designs of the Testator from being
    carried into execution, but they are nearly overcome, and a further benefaction
    to the same Institution gives promise of an extension to the Establishment, so
    that Teachers of eminence may give such a celebrity to it, as to attract a number
    of families, whom, but for the want of such a seminary, would have long since
    taken advantage of the cheapness of living, the salubrity of the air, and the
    beauty of the neighbourhood. There are several Charitable Societies, the most
    valuable is that for the Relief of Indigent and Aged Widows, established and administered
    by some benevolent Ladies of the place. There are two Mason Lodges ; and an annual
    Meeting is held, called the Trafalgar Club, of which the Duke of Gordon is Patron
    and President. The Manufactures of Forres are very limited. Linen yarn was formerly
    exported in great quantities, but that branch of Trade has almost entirely fallen
    off, and the Trade of the Town is now chiefly domestic. There is a branch of the
    British Linen Company Bank.

    House to the south, are the most remakable ; the latter, embowered in wood, looks
    through a noble vista on the Town, the view stretching far and wide over the Moray
    Firth, and the mountains of Sutherland and Ross. The environs of Forres, even
    within the Parish, afford many beautiful rides and walks, and if extended beyond
    its bounds, the banks of the Findhorn, towards its source, offers some of the
    finest river scenery in Scotland. But the chief attraction as a promenade, are
    the Cloven, or Cluny Hills, which arise to some considerable height, immediately
    behind the Town to the south. The highest of these Hills, which, as their name
    imports, rise in an isolated cluster, is crowned by an octagonal Tower, dedicated
    to the memory of Admiral Lord Nelson. To this, by personal labour, and pecuniary
    contribution, the Inhabitants of Forres have carried roads, which, sometimes winding
    around a shoulder, at others, forming Terraces, by embracing a whole hill, finally
    meet near the Tower, amidst thriving plantations, which cover the greater part
    of them. It is almost impossible to describe with effect, the splendid view from
    the summit ; it comprises all the elements of grand and picturesque scenery, plain
    and wood, sea and mountain. It must suffice to say, that part of nine Counties

    on that head ; some Antiquarians supposing it to have been placed there, to commemorate
    the death of King Duffus, and the execution of his murderers on that spot, and
    the tenor of the sculpture on the east face, gives strength to the supposition.

    \ jealousy of the merchants of London, and other English ports engaged in the\
    \ same trade, who accused the Glasgow merchants of fraud upon the revenue ; this\
    \ accusation was followed up by a number of new restrictions and vexatious regulations\
    \ being laid upon the trade, \u2014these impositions were the cause of a considerable\
    \ falling off in the importations to the Clyde, till the year 1735. The commerce\
    \ with America continued to advance till the year 1/50, when a new system commenced,\
    \ by opening warehouses in the New World, managed by partners in the mercantile\
    \ establishments of Glasgow ; this plan not only increased the extent of their\
    \ transactions, but opened up new sources of trade, so that before the unfortunate\
    \ war which separated these colonies from the mother country, the trade of Glasgow\
    \ with America had attained its greatest height, \u2014 the annual importations\
    \ of Tobacco were from 35 to 45,000 hogsheads. In the year immediately preceding\
    \ the war, 57,143 hogsheads were imported, of which 12,000 only were for home\
    \ consumption. Such was the extent of the imports of Tobacco into the Clyde, as\
    \ to engross more than the half of that article imported into Britain. In one\
    \ year, out of 90,000 hogsheads imported, Glasgow alone engrossed 49,000. The\
    \ American war was a severe blow to the trade of Glasgow and Greenock\u2014it\
    \ unfortunately happened that the balances due by America to Glasgow were uncommonly\
    \ great ; and as this trade then employed nearly the whole of the capital and\
    \ enterprise of the City, many of the most opulent merchants were ruined,"

    have long been famed over Europe and America for their neat and elegant formation.
    The manufacture of Cudbear, a Dye stuff prepared from a species of lichen, or
    rockmoss, is carried on here to a great extent, and unequalled perfection. The
    Staple Manufacture of Glasgow (Cotton), gives employment to a number of Chemical
    Works, Dye Works, Calendering Works, &c, and the great quantity of Machinery necessary
    in the construction of the numerous Spinning Mills, Power Looms, Steam Engines,
    and other works in the City and neighbourhood ; besides the making of Machinery,
    for all parts of the kingdom, employ a vast number of Millwrights, Engineers,
    Boiler-Builders, Iron and Brass Foundries, Smiths, Plumbers, &c. The Sugar Refining
    is here an extensive business ; the Distillation of Spirits, is carried on in
    the vicinjty on a very large scale ; and the Breweries are many and extensive.
    To the various articles belonging to the Cotton Manufacture, may be added those
    of Linen, Damask, Carpeting, Hats, Leather, Shoes, Saddlery, Gloves, Glass and
    Pottery Ware, Bricks, Tiles, TobaccoPipes, Ropes and Twine, Wire drawing and Wire

    by aTeference to Cleland's Annals of Glasgow, which furnish the most complete
    and minute details of the rise and progress of this City. Glasgow, although reckoned
    the second City in Scotland, is first in point of population and Manufacturing
    interest, as well as Trade. The principal Street, running east and west, acquires
    the names of the Gallowgate, Trongate, Argyle Street, and Anderson's Street, and
    extends in length one mile and three quarters ; the principal Street running north
    and south, called the Salt-Market, High Street, Kirk Street, and Castle Street,
    is nearly one mile long ; a fine Street runs parallel to the first mentioned,
    on the north, called Duke Street, and George Street, nearly a mile in length ;
    and from all these Streets a number of others branch off to the north and south.
    From Argyle Street, and the Trongate, three Streets lead to the Bridges, and River-Side,
    viz. the Salt Market to the Wooden Bridge ; Stockwell Street to the Old Bridge
    ; and Jamaica Street, to the New Bridge. The houses in all the Streets, are substantially
    built, with fronts of Hewn Stone ; the Streets are spacious and well paved, kept
    clean, with foot paths on each side ; the City and Suburbs are abundantly supplied
    with water, and the Streets and Shops are lighted with Gas. There are three large
    Squares, the largest is George's Square, in which stands the Statue of General
    Sir John Moore, a native of this City, who fell at Corunna in 1809. St Andrew's
    is a spacious Square, in the centre of which stands the elegant Church of that
    name ; St Enoch's Square,

    ; the members who were ecclesiastics dispersed themselves to avoid the fury of
    the populace, and it thus continued in a low state till James the Sixth granted
    a new charter of erection, and bestowed upon it some valuable property ; from
    that time it increased in reputation, until it has attained its present celebrity.
    In this University there are a Lord Chancellor, Lord Rector, Dean of Faculty,
    Principal, and Professors of Divinity, Church History, Logic, Anatomy, Mathematics,
    Theory and Practice of Physic, Moral Philosophy, Natural Philosophy, Civil Law,
    Practical Astronomy, Natural History, Greek, Humanity, Surgery, Chemistry, Botany,
    Oriental Languages, Midwifery, and Materia Medica. The College is a venerable
    building, and its antique Gothic ornaments towards the Street, present a singular
    contrast to the modern buildings in its vicinity. It is divided into four courts,
    with ample accommodation for the Professors and Class Rooms, &c, and occupies
    a space of nearly 10.,000 square yards. The number of Students average about twelve
    hundred annually, attending the different classes. The Library contains a large
    and valuable collection, to which all the students have access. In the Park or
    Gardens of the University, which are of large extent, stands the Observatory,

    foot, and 500 Horse, with Artillery Barracks, erected in the vicinity of the Town,
    during the late war. The Town is joined by a Bridge of three arches, across the
    Tyne, with the Nungate, which is without the Royalty. 'The date of the erection
    of Haddington into a Royal Burgh, cannot now be ascertained, as all its ancient
    records are lost. It is certain, that a Nunnery was built about a mile below the
    Town, on the north ; bank of the Tyne, in what is now called the Nungate, by Ada,
    Countess of Northumberland, and mother-of Malcolm the Fourth, and William the
    'Lyon ; for Nuns of the Certertian Order, in the year H78. In^he charter of erection,
    it is stated as being near meum Burgum 4e Hadinton. The side walls ofthis building
    are much delapidated, but the gables, with a vestige of the roof still remain.

    submitted to Edward the First, and had her rights restored. In the year 1306,
    Robert the BrUce, gave to his Town and people of Haddington, a renewal of the
    grant of their liberties, both Political and Commercial. In 1355, it was burnt
    by Edward the Third. Adam de Haddinton, and Adam de Congalton, Were appointed

    for treating of the liberation of David the Second, who had been taken prisoner
    at Durham, by the English, and kept captive in England for twelve years. On Christmas
    eve, 1358$ a most extraordinary inundation nearly destroyed the Nunnery, the river,
    swollen by excessive rains, swept away Houses, Villages, and Bridges, and numbers
    lost their lives in attempting to save their property. Henry the Fourth, having
    entered Scotland with a great army, arrived at Haddington, on the 15th of August
    1400, where he celebrated the Assumption of the Virgin, and remained there three
    days, previous to his departure for Leith* On St Ninian's day, 1421, this Town
    suffered greatly by an inundation of the river, and in 1432, again was nearly
    depopulated by a pestilence, which then afflicted the land. It was set fire to,
    by the English, when they evacuated the Town, on the 1st October 1549 ; and was
    totally consumed by fire, 1598. On the 4th October 177^> the Tyne rose 17 feet
    perpendicular, and laid half the Town under water, and continued so for several
    hours. There is a Brass Plate at the corner of a street, commemorative of this
    event, bearing this inscription, Quod non noctu, Deo gratias, nemo enim periit.

    Haddington gives the title of Earl to a branch of the Hamilton Family. The principal
    Trade of Haddington is in corn ; it is indeed the chief Grain Market in Scotland,
    and regulates all the other grain markets in the Country. There are no great Manufactures
    in the Town or neighbourhood ; a small quantity of coarse Woollen Cloth, and Blanketing
    is made, though these Manufactures were formerly much more considerable. There
    are some large Tan-works, and the Haddington Distillery, is upon an extensive
    scale ; there is also a Distillery in the Nungate, besides Breweries ; but the
    principal dependance of the Town, is upon its markets. The Butcher-Market is neat,
    clean, and well contrived for shelter, and abundantly supplied with choice meat
    of all kinds ; it may also contest the palm for quality, with any Market in Scotland.
    There are several charitable Institutions, for relief of the destitute, as well
    as for the education of the poor, and some benefit Societies, of the most respectable
    kind. The Grammar School is well conducted by able Masters, as are also other
    Schools for English, Writing and Accounts, and an Academy for Mathematics, Geography,
    and the higher branches of Education. The Boarding Schools for young Ladies, are
    of the most respectable description. The Town possesses a valuable Library. The
    Parish of Haddington comprehends nearly a square of six miles, in general arable,
    well enclosed, and in the highest state of cultivation ; abounding in Coal, Lime
    Stone, and Free Stone. The River Tyne intersects the parish, in which are numerous

    the ancient manor-house, when the district was known by the name of Cadzow. It
    retained this name till it was given to Sir Gilbert de Hamilton by King Robert
    the Bruce, who gave it the name of Hamilton. Opposite to these ruins, on the other

    in Normandy, from which the family of Hamilton have the title of Duke of Chatelherault,

    ornaments, suited to the grandeur of a Highland Castle, but the rest of the house
    is superbly fitted up in the modern stile, with exquisite taste. On entering the
    Bay, the Castle has a very majestic appearance, and the rising wood, which, for
    a considerable distance, adorns the domain, give to the Town an appearance of
    superior grandeur ; every stranger is struck with the neatness of the Town s which,
    though small is well built, and some of the houses may be denominated elegant.
    The enchanting scenery of Inverary and its neighbourhood, together with the comfortable
    accommodation of its Inns, attract a throng of genteel visitants in the summer
    season. From a convenient part oi the Town, a well built Quay projects so far
    into the Bay, as to enable Vessels of considerable burthen to load and unload
    at low water. The parish of Inverary, is about 18 miles long, and 3 in breadth,
    the general appearance is hilly, and even mountainous, interspersed with several
    tracts of flat ground, particularly about the Town, and the Vale of Glenshira,
    which is nearly 5 miles long. A considerable part of the flat ground is arable,
    with a deep rich soil, but the rest is shallow, and not naturally fertile. An
    improved system of Agriculture is followed on many farms, and here a species of
    drying barns, are in use ; a contrivance of the utmost utility in a country subject
    to wet and protracted harvests. The parish lies along the coast of Loch Fyne,
    and is watered by the Rivers Aray and Shira, which fall into that arm of the Sea,

    and Largs, now abolished. The revenues of the Town are extensive, arising from
    the customs, and a large tract of land, belonging to the community. The principal
    trade of Irvine is the Shipping of Coal for Ireland, of which, from 28 to 30,000
    tons are annually shipped to that quarter alone. There is a Ship-building yard,
    Rope-works, Tan-works, &c. and numbers are employed in the Weaving of Cotton Goods,
    for the Glasgow and Paisley Manufacturers. The imports into Irvine, consist chiefly
    of Grain from Ireland, of which, from 8 to 10,000 quarters are annually imported,
    besides large quantities brought coastways, from Galloway. Iron, Timber, Slates,
    Lime Stone, are also considerable articles of importation. The Shipping belonging
    to the port of Irvine, amounts to 80 or 90 Sail, employing about 600 Seamen. Formerly
    an extensive Herring Fishery was carried on here, but it, has been superseded
    by the Coal trade. Exclusive of the Established Church, there is a Meeting House
    for those in connexion with the United Secession, one Relief, and one Baptist
    Chapel. There is a branch of the Ayr Bank, and another of the Paisley Banking
    Company. The environs of the Town of Irvine are embellished by the beautiful seat
    of the Earl of Eglingtown, with the extensive pleasure-grounds, and the delightful
    mansion of Bourtree-Hill. The religious sect named Buchanites, took their rise
    in this place, from a woman of the name of Simpson, (Mrs. Buchan) ; their principal
    tenets were, the community of goods, and that true believers had no occasion to
    die. This woman

    and the County Town of Roxburghshire. It is 45 miles south of Edinburgh, 1 1 west
    of Kelso, 10 east of Hawick, and 12 miles north of the English Border. The local
    situation of Jedburgh is delightful ; it is situated on the banks of the river
    Jed, from whence its name, on the declivity of a Hill, and surrounded on all sides,
    by hills of a considerable elevation. It is a very ancient Burgh, and was a place
    of some importance, in the year 1165, as appears from a charter of William the
    Lyon, granted upon founding the Abbey of Jedburgh, or Jedwarth, as it is there
    sometimes called. It has the honour of Parochial precedency, being the oldest
    Parish in Scotland, of which any historical record has been transmitted to posterity.

    Towns on the English Border. There are four principal Streets in Jedburgh, which
    cross each other, at right angles, terminating in a large Square or Market-place
    ; the High Street runs parallel to the river, and that from the Castle Hill to
    the New Bridge, is broad, well paved, and clean. Within these few years, many
    new houses, in a fine style have been built, and many other improvements made,
    which have added greatly to the beauty of the Town. The County Gaol and Bridewell,
    built about three years since, is a fine building, it stands upon the site of
    the old Castle, and is called Jedburgh Castle. The arrangements and accommodations
    of the interior of the building, are well suited to the purposes for which it
    was built, and from its elevated situation, forms a grand object in the approach
    to the Town. The Town Hall, founded by the Marquis of Lothian in 181 1, is an
    elegant and spacious building. It contains rooms for transacting the business
    of the Burgh and County, the Sheriff and Justiciary Court Rooms, &c. The English
    and Grammar Schools, under the patronage of the Magistrates and the Heritors,
    are conducted upon the best principles, and supplied with able Teachers. There
    are also three public Libraries. A Dispensary was here established in the year
    1810, which has been a great benefit to the Town and County. Jedburgh, like the
    other Border Towns, suffered a temporary decline, in consequence of the Union
    of the two kingdoms in the year 1707Previous to this period, the Town of Jedburgh,

  clean_text: 217 der Towns, carried on an extensive contraband trade with England,
    by introducing various articles, such as Malt, Skins, and Salt, which at that
    time, paid no duty or tax in Scotland, and were therefore advantageously exchanged
    for English Wool, which they exported from the Firth of Forth to France, and the
    returns from thence yielded a very great profit. The loss of this source of gain,
    was followed by the depopulation and consequent decay of the place to a considerable
    extent ; and it is only of late years, by the introduction of a few manufactures,
    particularly those ot Woollen, that the Town has revived. At present, the manufacture
    of Narrow Cloths, Carpets, Flannels, Blankets, and Stockings, are carried on to
    a very considerable amount, and are upon the increase. The Tanning of Leather,
    and the Dressing of Sheep Skins, are also considerable branches of trade. But
    the want of Coal, is an insuperable obstacle to the extensive introduction, and
    progressive advance of manufactures in the Town and neighbourhood of Jedburgh
    ; there is no coal nearer than Ryechester, twenty miles distant on the English
    Border ; and the nearest coal field to the north, are in the Lothians, at double
    that distance from the Town. There are several large Peat-Mosses in the neighbourhood,
    which supply the inhabitants with fuel, who are unable to purchase coal, an article
    that sells here at a higher price, than in any other place in Scotland. Besides
    the Parish Church, there are three places for divine worship, belonging to dissenting
    Congre-* gations, viz, two to the United Secession, and a Re* Jief Chapel.

    iron bars, have been employed to unite more firmly the opposite sides of the quadrangle,
    and to impart a greater degree of strength to the whole fabric. The ancient narrow
    stair, which reached from the bottom to the top of the Tower, but which from its
    decay in some parts, rendered the ascent rather perilous, has been repaired, so
    that now (1827,) the visitor has it in his power to enjoy from a great elevation,
    a most interesting view, as the country around abounds with rich and romantic
    scenery. The ancient Chapel, where the service of the Catholic Church was wont
    to be performed, and which was appropriated to the interment of the more remote
    ancestors of the Marquis of Lothian, has been covered in. The effect of the whole
    repairs is such, as fully realizes the expectations of the original projectors,
    and to compensate for the labour and expense which has been bestowed upon this
    venerable pile. There was also a convent of Franciscans in this Town, founded
    by the citizens in 1513, but besides their houses, they had no revenues, being
    mendicants. The Market-day is Tuesday, and there are four annual Fairs, namely,

    with that river, and is surrounded on all sides by hills covered with wood, which
    form a beautiful amphitheatre. The Town is built in the Flemish stile. The principal
    street runs in a direction parallel with the river, at the southern extremity
    of which is a spacious Square or Market-place, from which diverge four of the
    principal Streets at equal distances. Within the last two years, the north side
    of the Square has been nearly all rebuilt, and elegant houses erected ; this Square
    also contains the principal shops. A new Street has also been opened from the

    15 miles south from Perth, 13 miles north of Inverkeithing, 19 west of Cupar,
    and 2/ north by west of Edinburgh. Kinross is rather a straggling Town ; the old
    part is irregular and mean, but of late years the appearance of the Town has been
    much improved by the erection of a great number of new houses, built in a good
    stile ; the Streets paved, and a more modern appearance given to the whole of
    the Town. The old Town House, or Prison, situated near the middle of the Town,
    is a very old building, and about to be superseded by a new edifice, erecting
    at the north entrance into the Town, on an elegant plan, to contain the County
    Rooms, Sheriff Court Rooms, &c. There are three excellent Inns, where the traveller

    but more remarkable for its vicinity to Loch Leven ; this is a noble sheet of
    water, situated at the foot of the westernmost of the Lomond Hills ; it is about
    twelve miles in circumference. In this expanse of water there are four islands,
    the largest of which is St Serf, on the south east side, containing an area of
    forty acres, on it formerly stood the ancient Priory of Loch Leven, dedicated
    to St Serf, or Servanus, said^o have been founded by Brude, King of the Picts,
    who made a grant of this island to the Culdees. In the reign of David the First,
    this island was bestowed on the Clergy of the Church of Rome. Andrew Winton, author
    of the Loch Leven Chronicle, who died in the reign of James the First, was Prior
    of this place. The Castle of Loch Leven, anciently a royal residence, stands on
    another island in the north-west part of the Loch. This island is about two acres
    in extent, and the Castle stands nearly in the middle of it, encompassed by a
    rampart of stone. This Castle, according to tradition, was the seat of Congalus,
    son of Dongartus, King of the Picts, who is said to have founded it about the
    year 452. It was granted by Robert the Third, to Douglas, Laird of Loch Leven,

    \ Nobles resolved that she should be eonfined during her life, in the Fortress\
    \ of Loch Leven, and they subscribed an order for her commitment. The Lords Ruthven\
    \ and Lindsey, were appointed to inform her that they were commanded to put in\
    \ execution the order for her commitment ; they charged her women to take from\
    \ her all her ornaments and her royal attire ; a mean dress was put upon her,\
    \ and in this disguise they conveyed her with precipitation to the prison appointed\
    \ for her ; here she was kept under the care of the Mother of the Earl of Murray,\
    \ (soon after made Regent of Scotland,) who had been married to Douglas of Loch\
    \ Leven, and who treated her with great indignity and barbarity. Mary here suffered\
    \ all the miseries of a rigorous captivity of eleven months ; here, too, she was\
    \ forced to sign the resignation of her Crown, to her infant Son, and the appointment\
    \ of Murray as Regent during his minority. She was liberated from this captivity\
    \ by George Douglas, her keeper's youngest brother, a youth of eighteen years\

    adherents A bunch of keys, supposed to be those of the Castle, which Queen Mary
    threw into the Loch when she made hey escape, were found a few years ago, and
    are now in the Museum of the Antiquarian Society of Edinburgh. The place where
    the Queen landed on the south-west side of the Loch, is still pointed out by the
    inhabitants of Kinross, to the numerous visitors of this interesting spot. Loch
    Leven abounds with fish, among which are Pike, Perch, Char, Eels, and very fine
    Trouts of a peculiar delicacy. The fishing is rented at one hundred pounds per
    annum, by a fish-monger in Edinburgh. The other two smaller islands are only of
    note as tending to heighten the picturesque and beautiful scenery. Around the
    Castle are some ancient trees, whose moss grown trunks announce their antiquity,
    and whose shrivelled tops scarce afford shelter to a few solitary crows, now the
    only tenants of this solitude. Kinross House, in the vicinity of the Town, is
    a large and elegant structure, built in 1685, by the cele* brated Architect, Sir
    William Bruce, for his own residence. The neighbourhood of the Town is delightful
    ; and besides Kinross House, there are several gentlemen's seats on the borders
    of the Loch, remark* able for the beauty of their situation. The Parish of Kinross

    is 25 miles south-east of Glasgow, 15 miles east by south of Hamilton, and 32
    miles west of Edinburgh. The Town contains one principal street, nearly half a
    mile long, bending from the east to north-west, and another street parallel to
    this, called the north Venal. The Wellgate is w a handsome street running south
    from the High Street, and the Bloomgate, and Castle Street, stretch from the centre
    of the Town to the west, or Castle Hill. The Town is neat, well paved, and clean,
    and contains many good buildings. The Parish Church, in the High Street, is a

    exploit of the celebrated Wil iam Wallace that Patriot having here commenced his
    glorious career, by the defeat and death of William de Hesilrig, or Hesilope,
    the English Sheriff of Lanarkshire. Wallace had married a lady of the name of
    Bradfoot, the heiress of Lamington, and lived with her in privacy, in the Town
    of Lanark ; while here, he with a few friends, had a fray with a party of English,
    when Wallace was overpowered, and fled to Cartlane Craigs ;on this the Sheriff
    seized his lady, and put her to death. To revenge her death, it is said, that
    Wallace having collected his friends, attacked the Sheriff in the night, killing
    him with 24Q Englishmen. The chief trade of Lanark is the making of Shoes, a few
    Stockings are also made ; but the Cotton manufacture employs the bulk of the population.
    William Lithgow, the celebrated traveller, was born, died, and buried in this
    Parish. The scenery around Lanark is particularly interesting ; the banks on both
    sides of the Clyde, are precipitous and rocky, beautifully wooded, and the romantic
    scenery at the celebrated " Falls of Clyde," are visited and admired by all travellers.
    About a mile south of Old Lanark, in a deep valley, on the northern bank of the
    Clyde, is situated the beautiful Village of New Lanark. This village was begun
    in 1785, for the accommodation of the work people, employed at the Cotton Mills
    here, erected by the late David Dale, Esq. of Glasgow. This spot was almost a
    morass, when feued by Mr Dale, from the late Lord Brax field, and had no other

    \ elegant Buildings, that it appears rather an extensive street, than the road\
    \ to the Port. The old streets in Leith are narrow and confined, and the houses\
    \ inconvenient, but on the Shore there are now many elegant Buildings, though\
    \ the street is inconveniently narrow for the traffic now carried on. The two\
    \ districts of North and South Leith are joined by two elegant Draw Bridges across\
    \ the Harbour, one built in I788, and the other in 1800 ; and a Bridge to the\

    \ so far, in 1485, as to prohibit, under severe penalties, the taking of a Leither\
    \ into partnership ; and that none of the revenues of Edinburgh should be farmed\
    \ by an inhabitant of Leith. To relieve themselves from these oppressions, the\
    \ inhabitants of Leith, purchased from Logan for \xA33000 scotch, the superiority\
    \ of their Town, and it was e rected into a free Burgh of Barony, by Mary of Lorraine,\
    \ who promised to erect it into a Royal Burgh ; this however was never done ;\
    \ and her daughter, Queen Mary, in violation of the rights of the people of Leith,\
    \ sold the superiority of the Burgh to the Town Council of Edinburgh ; to whom\
    \ it has since been confirmed by the grants of successive sovereigns. About this\
    \ time, the inhabitants of Leith were divided into four classes, viz. Mariners,\

  clean_text: 258 traordinary Ship of War was built at Leith, of dimensions so great,
    says an old chronicle, as to ex* haust all the woods in Fife ! It appears that
    the Town and Shipping of Leith were burnt in 1313, in 1410, and in 1522. In 1544,
    Henry the Eighth sent an army into Scotland, who burnt the Town of Leith, and
    the Abbey of Holyrood-house, when a captain, under the Earl of Hertford, carried
    off the Brazen Font from that Chapel, arrogantly dedicating it in his own name,
    to the Church of St Albans in Hertfordshire. Leith was again burnt in 1547, with
    all the Shipping belonging to the Town. Leith sustained a severe siege in 1 559-60,
    by the French, during the regency of Mary of Lorraine. Mary Queen of Scots landed
    at Leith, from France, on the 20th August 1561, James the Sixth, with his young
    Queen, landed here from Denmark in 1590. A plague desolated Leith, in the year
    1580, and the same pestilence carried off 3000, or nearly threefourths of the
    inhabitants, between the months of April and December 1645. The Town was laid
    under contribution by Cromwell in 1650, and here he built fortifications and established
    a powerful garrison. At this period many wealthy English families settled in Leith.
    Amongst the memorabilia of Leith, we must not omit the landing of His Majesty
    George the Fourth, on the 15th August 1822, a period that will long be remembered
    by the inhabitants of Leith ; the preparations for this august ceremony, were
    conducted with al 1 the shew and magnificence which the occasion demanded, and
    which the people, at all times remarka* ble for loyalty, could exhibit.

    themselves, pass unperceived through a pillar, and make their final exit through
    another mouth, in a large stream, from which the inhabitants are supplied with
    water. The whole of this Architectural curiosity was planned, and the richest
    parts of the ornaments executed, by a mason of Edinburgh, Robert Gray, who had
    only one hand ! the whole of this extraordinary structure is crowned by a lion,
    supporting the royal arms of Scotland. Several other fountains of plain masonry,
    are met with in various parts of the Town, insomuch, that Linlithgow is famed
    to a proverb for its Wells. Some of the more remarkable occurrences which have
    taken place in Linlithgow, deserve to be mentioned in an account of the Town.
    In the reign of Robert Bruce, one Binnock took the Castle, then held by an English
    Garrison, by introducing a wain of Hay, which concealed a number of armed men
    ; they killed the Garrison, and razed the Castle. At Linlithgow Bridge, a battle
    was fought between the Earls of Arran and Lennox, during the minority of James
    the Fifth. In a house on the south side of the street, a little west of the cross,
    Hamilton of Bothwell-haugh, shot the Regent Murray, from a balcony on the 23d
    January 15/1 ; and here, the famous solemn League and Covenant was burnt with
    great formality in 1662, with every mark of dishonour and indignity, which the
    Court party could invent. It was also the place where the Scottish Parliament
    frequently met.

    of Angus, or Forfar, seated in a flat sandy peninsula, formed by the German Ocean,
    the river south Esk, and a large expanse of water, called the Bason. It is 13
    miles north of Arbroath, 22 south of Stonehaven, 21 east by north of Forfar, S
    east of Brechin, and 94 miles from Edinburgh, on the great northern road. The
    Town is neatly built, consisting of a fine spacious main street, with other streets
    diverging from it. The houses, though not elegant, are in general well built and
    regular. Many houses in the south end, or old part of the Town, have their gables
    to the street, in the Flemish style ; but the new erections in the streets lately
    laid out, are in a higher degree of elegance and taste. The Parish Church is a
    handsome building, elegantly finished, 98 feet in front, by 65 feet over walls
    ; but the old steeple to which it is attached, and its confined situation, render
    it inconspicuous. The Episcopal Chapel on the Links, to the eastward of the Town
    is a very neat building, elegantly fitted up, and. has a very fine Organ, M M

    785. It is conducted on a most liberal plan, and now contains many thousand volumes,
    by the best authors. A Mechanic's Library has also been formed, it already contains
    a valuable collection. The enumeration of the public buildings and establishments
    of the Town, would far exceed our limits. Montrose has been long distinguished
    for the excellence of its Academy and public Schools, where every branch of liberal
    education is taught, in a manner not inferior to any part of the kingdom. These
    schools have attracted notice, not only for the excellent accommodation of the
    pupils, but from the high character they have acquired, from the mode of conducting
    these seminaries, and the eminence of the masters. Private establishments are
    numerous, and afford the means of acquiring every genteel and modern accomplishment.

    \ of antiquity, Montrose ranks among the foremost, as a Royal Burgh. It has enjoyed\
    \ extensive municipal privileges for upwards of six hundred years, having obtained\
    \ its first charter from King David the First. The Government of the Town consists\
    \ of a Provost, three Bailies, a Dean of Guild Treasurer, Hospital Master, Eight\
    \ Merchant, and four Trade's Councillors ; the Councillors are annually elected\
    \ by open poll of the Guildry and Trades. The revenue of the Town, arising from\
    \ Fisheries, Shore dues, &c, is about \xA33000 per annum ; it joins with Aberdeen,\

    \ now endeavouring to raise funds for the erection of a Chain Bridge of suspension,\
    \ which, if executed, according to the plan proposed, will be one of the most\
    \ magnificent structures in the island. The present Bridge is 800 feet long, and\
    \ 33 feet broad, having a stone arch at each end, the timber part alone is 411\
    \ feet long. The river is here very deep, having 35 feet water at spring tides,\
    \ and 20 feet at low water in ordinary tides, and so rapid, that during ebb, it\
    \ runs at the rate of six miles an hour. The building of this Bridge cost ,\xA3\
    13,000, and leads to an elegant new Street, opening into the centre of the Town,\
    \ obtained by cutting through a considerable Hill, called Fort Hill, on which\
    \ the ancient Castle of the Constable stood ; the Bridge allows a communication\
    \ with the river above, by means of a draw. The Shipping trade of Montrose is\
    \ very considerable ; a great number of Vessels are employed in the Baltic trade.\
    \ The coasting trade is extensive, and there are four large Vessels employed in\

    Ling fishery,, forms a large portion of the trade ; but the trade in Corn is by
    far the most important branch of the export trade. The traffic in grain, from
    the port of Montrose, exceeds that of any other port in Scotland. The Manufactures
    of the Town, are chiefly those of Osnaburghs, Sail Cloth, and coarse Linen, which
    are made here to a great extent. The Tanning of Leather, forms a considerable
    branch of the Manufactures of the Town ; there are several extensive Rope-works,
    besides many other Manufactures of less importance. The Links, or Downs of Montrose,
    between the Town, and the Sea, are the most extensive of any in Scotland, comprehending
    a circuit of two miles ; this large extent of fine smooth surface is well adapted
    for the exercise of the ancient game of golf, (a game peculiar to Scotland,) which
    is here greatly practised ; on these Downs also is the race-ground, inferior to
    none in Scotland. Exclusive of the Established Church, this Town contains an English
    and a Scotch Episcopal Chapel, and Meeting Houses belonging to the Burghers, Secession,
    Baptists, Glassite, United Secession, Congregationalists, and Methodists. The
    Banking Establishments are, the Montrose Bank, Branch Banks of the British Linen
    Company, Dundee Union, and one private Bank. The Market day is Friday, and two
    annual fairs are held, on the first Wednesday after Whitsunday, and Martinmas,

    of Nairn-shire, situated upon the coast of the Moray Firth, where the river Nairn
    flows into that arm of the Sea. The Town is pleasantly situated on the bank of
    the river, near the shore, and consists chiefly of one neat Street. Nairn lies
    21 miles north-east of Inverness, 18 miles west of Elgin, 100 north-west of Aberdeen,
    and 164 miles north of Edinburgh. The Town and County Jail, in the centre of the
    Town, is an elegant edifice, containing the County Rooms, Court-Rooms, &c. The
    County-Room is remarkably fine, spacious, and elegant, and is frequently used
    for balls and assemblies. The whole structure is in an elegant stile of Architecture,
    built of beautiful Free-stone, and surmounted by a very handsome spire. The Town
    is neat and clean, and in general the houses are good and substantial ; the Harbour
    though small, is convenient ; and considerable improvements have of late been

    the expense was defrayed by subscription, aided by Government. At the west end
    of the Town, a neat monument has been erected to the memory of Mr John Straith,
    who was forty years school-master at Nairn, as a tribute of respect by his numerous
    scholars. There are several benevolent, and other societies of a very respectable
    description ; there is a Subscription Library and News-Room, the latter of which
    is open to the admission of strangers. The date of the erection of Nairn into
    a Royal Burgh is unknown, as the oldest charter in existence is one from James
    the Sixth, dated in 1589, being a renewal of one granted by Alexander, probably
    the First of that name, King of Scotland. That charter was confirmed by one from
    Charles the Second in 1661, by which the government of the Town is vested in seventeen
    persons, viz. a Provost, three Bailies, a Dean of Guild, Treasurer, and eleven
    Councillors, nine of whom to be a quorum. The Gentlemen of the County are eligible
    to any of these Offices in the Burgh, except Bailie, Dean of Guild, and Treasurer.
    The whole trades form only one Incorporation. Nairn joins with Fortrose, Inverness,
    and Forres, in returning a Member to Parliament. The funds of the Town were formerly
    very considerable, but have been much delapidated by time. The white fishing on
    the coast is carried on to a considerable extent, and employs about 12 or 14 boats
    ; the Salmon fishing in the river is also productive. The Herring Fishery bus
    of late years been prosecuted with great spirit

    per annum. The exports of Nairn consist chiefly of the produce of the different
    Fisheries, and of Fir wood, from the extensive woods and plantations of the county.
    The imports are Coal, Lime-stone, and Merchant goods. The Town of Nairn has undergone
    some local changes ; it was originally situated about half a mile from the spot
    where it now stands, and was defended by a castle ; the ruins of which are now
    covered by the sea, so that only the foundation of it is visible in neap tides.
    This ancient castle was a royal fort in the reign of Malcolm the First. Nairn
    formerly gave the title of Baron to the family of Nairn, attainted for their concern
    in the rebellion in 1745. The weekly Market-day is Friday, and there are annual
    Fairs on the 1 8th day of February, on the first Tuesday in March, the first Friday

    28th of September O. S., on the 10th day of October O. S., and on the first Tuesday
    after Inverness Martinmas Market. Besides the Established Church, there is a meeting
    house belonging to the Secession, and an Independent Chapel. The Parish of Nairn
    is eight miles long from north to south, and six broad from east to west. Along
    the coast the soil is sandy, and clay on the banks of the river Nairn ; and the
    southern district is a rich heavy mould. From the coast of the Moray Firth, the
    ground rises gradually to the south, terminating in the hill of Urchany, which

    \ with a noble wall of hewn stone. This wall stood till 1781\xBB when the garden\

    building is decorated with a profusion ot ornaments, especially the great west
    and north doors, than which, scarce any thing lighter or richer can be imagined."
    This church was repaired about thirty five years ago. At the south-east corner
    of the church is an Aisle, probably the private oratory of the Monks, now the
    burying place of the family of Abercorn ; it is 48 feet long, by 24 broad, and
    in the opinion of Mr Pennant, " is by much the greatest curiosity in Paisley ;"
    this he says in allusion to its remarkable echo, which was in his time one of
    the finest in the world, and has been noticed by most topographers in a stile
    of enthusiasm. Much of this echo is now lost, partly from the rebuilding of a
    large tomb, consecrated to the memory of Margery Bruce, (the daughter of King
    Robert Bruce, wife of Walter, great Steward of Scotland, and mother of King Robert
    the Second, from whom descended the royal line of Stewart,) and partly from laying
    open the brick work which filled up the interstices of a beautiful window. Near
    to this monument are the graves of Elizabeth Muir, and Euphemia Ross, both consorts
    of Robert the Second. The revenues of this Abbey were the richest in Scotland,
    comprehending a great deal of property in every part of the Kingdom, besides the
    tythes of 28 different parishes. The Chronicon Clugniense, or the Black Book of
    Paisley, so often referred to in Scottish History, was a chronicle of public affairs

    Peebles-shire, delightfully situated on a fine plain on the northern bank of the
    river Tweed, over which is an ancient Stone Bridge of five arches, supposed to
    have been built in the reign of Malcolm Canmore A little to the west of this Bridge,
    the Tweed is joined by the Eddlestone or Peebles Water, from the north, (over
    which there is also a bridge,) which divides the Old, from the New Town. Peebles
    lies 22 miles south of Edinburgh, 6 west of Innerleithen, 2"] east from Lanark,
    50 east from Glasgow, and 54 miles north from Dumfries. The Town consists of one
    principal Street, and the Northgate. The public buildings are handsome structures,
    and elegant beyond what is often met with in small towns ; indeed, the whole of
    the houses in Peebles, are neat, commodious, and well built. Some of the public
    buildings deserve notice. The Church erected in the year 1782, on the site of
    the old Castle, stands on an eminence at the west end of the High Street, it is

    and the Grammar Schools, are likewise handsome buildings, the latter, facing a
    large green, which is common to the inhabitants, and affords an excellent play
    ground. Of the ancient buildings of Peebles, there remains the ruins of the Church
    of St Mary, with its steeple entire, standing in the centre of the Church-yard,
    and the ruins of Cross-Kirk, built by Alexander the Third, in 1257, dedicated
    to the Holy Cross, and Saint Nicholas ; the steeple of this church is also entire.
    Alexander built a house contiguous to this church, for himself, which continued
    for ages to be a royal residence. It was here the Poem of " Peebles to the Play"
    was written, in which is described, many of the diversions and festivals of the
    times, by James the First. The approach to Peebles from the north, is by the street
    called the Northgate, leading into the High Street, which lies at an angle turning
    to the west. Eddlestone water, leaving its southerly course, winds to the west
    before it joins the Tweed. This river runs along the south side of the Town on
    the east, and its junction with the Tweed, forms an angular point of land, which
    is the termination of the New Town to the west. This peninsula is laid out in
    ornamental grounds, and a large bowling green ; here stands the Parish Church,
    Jail, and Town Mills. The High Street runs to the east from this point, which
    is very spacious, clean, and tastefully paved. The Old Town is also situated on

    the Third, in the thirteenth century, down to the accession of James VI. to the
    throne of England. Peebles-shire is a pastoral County, but the Haughs on the banks
    of the Tweed, and Peebles water are rich and fertile ; the Town is situated in
    the centre of the Parish, on a large and beautiful plain, almost surrounded by
    hills, forming an extensive amphitheatre. At a short distance from the Town, is
    Nidpath Castle, the property of the Earl of Wemyss and March ; and the romantic
    ruins of Horsburgh Castle, stand a few miles below the Town. In the more immediate
    neighbourhood of Peebles, are the elegant modern mansions and extensive plantations
    of King's Meadows, Hay Lodge, the beautiful villa of Alexander Campbell Esq. Kerfield,
    Venlaw, Rosetta, Minden, and Langside. Sir John Hay Bart, of Smithfield and Hayston,
    is the principal proprietor in the parish. A few years ago, Sir John erected an
    elegant Wire Bridge over the Tweed, in a most romantic Glen, about a mile below
    the Town, which facilitates the communication with his estate, lying on both sides
    of the river, and is at the same time, a much admired ornament to the grounds.
    There is no charter extant, by which the date of the erection of Peebles into
    a Royal Burgh can be ascertained, but the probability is, that it was early in
    the reign of Alexander the Third, the munificent patron of this Town. So late

    \ of Perth/' was founded in 1784, for the purpose of promoting antiquarian research,\
    \ as well as every subject connected with Philosophy, Belles Letters, and the\
    \ Fine Arts. The Society possess a large collection of valuable coins, medals,\
    \ and manuscripts, besides a variety of natural curiosities ; their cabinet of\
    \ minerals is uncommonly rich. The bridge of Perth forms the communication with\
    \ the Burgh of Kinnoul, commonly called Bridge-end, from its local situation.\
    \ This Burgh contains many of the most beautiful seats in the immediate vicinity\
    \ of Perth, both on the sides of Kinnoul hill, and on the banks of the river.\
    \ The Palace of Scoon, which lies on the banks of the Tay, above Perth, was the\
    \ ancient residence of the Scottish Kings, the place of their coronation, and\
    \ the scene of many splendid actions. Here formerly stood an Abbey, founded by\
    \ Alexander the First in 1114, dedicated to the Holy Trinity. Scoon is said by\
    \ some historians to have been the ancient capital of the Picts, but it certainly\
    \ was the chief seat of the Scottish Monarchs, as early as the time of Kenneth\
    \ the Second, who began his reign in 843. Here was the famous stone seat, used\
    \ as the coronation chair of the Pictish Monarchs, prior to the reign of Kenneth\
    \ the Second, who brought it to Scoon, where it remained as the coronation chair\
    \ of the succeeding Scottish Kings, till 1290, when Edward the First carried it\
    \ to England. The Palace of Scoon is a large modern building, and contains many\

    yards, by a dry ditch and interior low wall, with an iron rail. Inside of this

  clean_text: PORTOBELLO. Portobello is a considerable village, in the parish of Duddingston,
    three miles east of Edinburgh, on the coast of the Frith of Forth. It derives
    its name trom a Cottage still standing, so denominated in commemoration of the
    taking of Portobello on the Spanish Main, by Admiral Vernon in 1/39. For many
    years, it could boast of only a few scattered houses, erected chiefly for the
    workmen employed in the manufacturing of Brick and Tyle, for which there is abundance
    of fine clay adjoining the village on the west. This village is situated in a
    beautiful surrounding country, sheltered from the west by Arthur's Seat and Salisbury
    Craigs, which have a gradual slope to the sea. The agreeable softness of the sandy
    beach, the purity of the air, the convenient distance from Edinburgh, the advantage
    of a post three times a-day, and the facility of communication by means of the
    numerous coaches constantly passing and re-passing, have rendered it one of the
    most desirable places of

    the demolition of the castle in 1685. About the year 1/60, a Herring Fishery was
    established here, and carried on for many years with great success, in consequence
    of which, the ruinous houses were rebuilt, and several new streets were added.
    Abdut the year 17^0, the town possessed only one decked vessel of inconsiderable
    burden, but in the course of the following thirty years, they had accumulated
    shipping to the amount of 4246 tons. ][Jnder the fostering care of the Earl of
    Bute the industry of the inhabitants has been exerted ; and by vigorous perseverance,
    and the aid of their public spirited and noble proprietor, Rothesay has become
    a place of consequence. The town remained stationary for a number of years, till
    lately, when it became a fashionable watering place ; many fine streets have been
    laid down, and some elegant houses have been built, in consequence of the rapid
    demand for genteel accommodation. These new streets stretch out from the old town,
    to a considerable distance on the north and east sides of the Bay. The erection
    of the Government Custom House, and the establishment of a large Cotton Spinning-mill,
    in the year 177^j gave a new impulse to the industry of the inhabitants, by affording
    employment to the young, and to those who could not be employed in the more active
    business of the Fishery. This Manufactory employs about four hundred persons,
    and the Weaving by Power Looms, lately introduced, with a number of other branches
    of the Cotton Manufacture, connected with the spinning and weaving trade, will
    give employment to many more,

    of Rothesay, and indeed, of the whole island of Bute. They have a few vessels
    employed in the carrying trade to Glasgow aud other ports. From Glasgow the town
    is supplied with coal ; there are indications of coal on the island, but none
    have been found worth working. Peat is found on the island, which supply the inhabitants
    of the parishes with fuel, though coal is chiefly used in the town. The natives
    of the island are represented as being fond and partial to a sea-faring life.
    The English and Gaelic language are spoken indiscriminately by the inhabitants.
    Rothesay is the County Town of Bute-shire, where the courts of law are held for
    the trial of minor offences ; all criminal cases are sent to Inverary. The shire
    of Bute includes the islands of Bute, Arran, the Great and Little Cambrays, Inchmarnock,
    and the small Island of Pladda. The government of the town is vested in a Provost,
    two Bailies, a Dean of Guild, a Treasurer, and twelve Councillors, annually chosen
    ; and unites with Ayr, Irvine, Campbelltown, and Inverary, in sending a Member
    to Parliament. This shire, and that of Caithness, return a Member alternately.
    Rothesay is a very ancient Royal Burgh, having received its first charter from
    Robert the Third, in the year 1400, when its castle was a royal residence ; and
    its privileges were further confirmed and extended, by a charter of James the
    Fourth, in 1585. The town is more immediately under the patronage of the most

    Selkirk is pleasantly situated on a rising ground, on the south bank of the river
    Ettrick, commanding an extensive prospect in every direction. Formerly the Town
    was but meanly built, and could convey to a stranger, no idea of its ancient importance.
    It has of late been greatly improved, the Streets have been levelled and paved
    ; and many large new houses have been built, some of them elegant. A new Townhouse,
    containing apartments for the Sheriff Court, Town's Courts, and for public and
    other meetings ; and a good Library-room, has lately been built, adorned with
    a handsome Spire and Clock. The old Jail, which stood in the middle of the Street,
    has been taken down ; and a new Prison has been built in a more eligible situation,
    on the north side of the Town, surrounded by a high wall, enclose ing an area,
    in which the prisoners have liberty to walk. Selkirk is governed by two Bailies,

    Bailies, a Dean of Guild, a Treasurer, and Council ; it has seven incorporated
    trades, and joins with Cupar, Dundee, Perth, and Forfar, in returning a Member
    to Parliament. It is evident, from the ruins of houses widely scattered in every

    confirmation, it consisted originally of three colleges. St Salvador's college
    in North Street, was founded in 1455, by the celebrated Bishop Kennedy, the buildings
    form three sides of a square, with a handsome steeple and spire 156 feet high,
    over the gateway, in which there is a clock. The chapel of this college, is in

    was removed about JQ years ago ; at which time the beautiful tomb of the founder,
    was much injured by the ignorance of those who conducted the repairs. In this
    tomb were discovered, in 1583, six silver maces of very elegant workmanship, one

    the north-gate, founded by William Wishart, Bishop of that See, in 1274 ; nothing
    now remains of this edifice, but a part of the garden wall. The Grey-friars had
    a convent in South Street, founded by Bishop Kennedy, and finished by his successor
    Patrick Graham, about the year 1478, and de T dicated to St Francis. The only
    remains of these buildings is a small fragment, with an arched roof, in the Gothic
    stile, extremely elegant, supposed to have been the north cross aisle of the Chapel,
    There was another religious house, called the Provostry of Kirk-heugh, situated
    on the high ground, above the harbour, said to be the most ancient religious establishment
    in St Andrews, now wholly destroyed. To the north of the Town stands the ruins
    of the Castle, said to be buijt by Bishop Roger, about the year 1200. It was repaired
    and enlarged by Bishop Lamberton, about 1328. It sustained several sieges in the
    wars with England, and continued in a ruinous state, until it was repaired by
    Bishop Trail, about the end of the fourteenth century, who died here in 1401.
    It appears to have been a quadrangular building, surrounded by the sea, on the
    east and north, and defended on the land side by a fosse. Cardinal Beaton resided
    in this Castle, and the window is still shewn, out of which he glutted his eyes
    with the martyrdom of George Wishart, on the 1st March 1545, attended with circumstances
    of peculiar barbarity ; and in this castle, the Cardinal met a deserved death,
    from the hands of the Reformers, on the 29th May 1546. Many of the most remarkable

    and magnificence, impress strongly upon the mind, a very high idea of the ancient
    splendour Of this ecclesiastical city. So early as the beginning of the sixth
    century, tradition states St Andrews to have been the seat of the Culdees, or
    first Christian Priests of the country ; and it yet remains, after the revolutions
    of ages, one of the first seats of learning in Scotland. It was also, from a very
    remote period, a place of trade, with foreign countries, by bartering the produce
    of its herring and white fishery, for articles of luxury, then probably in great
    demand for the religious establishments of the city. The University of St Andrews
    can boast among the names of its professors, many of the most distinguished characters
    of former times ; and still continues to produce from its seminaries in modern
    times, many able and distinguished individuals, in every branch of science and
    literature. In addition to the Churches belonging to the Establishment, there
    is an Episcopal Chapel, and a Burgher, and Independent Meeting-house. A branch
    of the Bank of Scotland has been long established in the Town. The market-day
    is Monday, and annual Fairs are held on the second Thursday in April, 23d day
    of May, the first Tuesday in July, the first day of August, and on St Andrew's
    day, the 30th November, all old stile, except the last one. Population of the

    only confirming some additional privileges formerly conferred on the Burghers
    and Freemen. About the middle of the twelfth century, it became a Royal residence.
    David the First kept his Court in it, probably that he might be near to the Abbey

    of James the Second ; and here, he murdered with his own hand, his kins* man William

    of this palace, and built a noble hall fori the meetings of Parliament, which
    is now converted into barracks. Adjoining to the Parliament House, is the Chapel
    Royal, erected by James the Sixth, in 1593, for the baptism of his Son, Prince

    rock, on which the Town is built, is at least coeval with the Town itself. In
    1009 it was the place of rendezvous of the Scotch army, during an invasion of
    the Danes. In the twelfth century it was one of the most important Fortresses
    in the kingdom, and was one of the four strong holds given up to the English,
    as part of the ransom of William the Lion, who had been taken prisoner by them,
    in the year 1174. During the usurpation of Edward the First, it was several times
    taken and retaken by the English and Scots ; in the former of whose hands it remained
    for ten years, until retaken by Robert Bruce, after the battle of Bannockburn,
    in 1314. It was a short time in the possession of the English in 1333, and was
    lastly taken by General Monk, in the year 1651. It was besieged by the rebels
    for a short time in 1746. Stirling is one of the Scottish Forts, which by the

  clean_text: STONEHAVEN, Stonehaven, or Stonehive, is a sea-port Town, in the parish
    of Dunnottar, in Kincardine-shire, situa-. ted on that part of the coast, where
    the river of Carron, and the water of Cowie, pour their joint streams into the
    German Ocean. It lies 15 miles south by west of Aberdeen, 22 miles south by east
    of Montrose, 13 north-east of Laurencekirk, 67 north-east of Perth, and 116 miles
    north-east of Edinburgh, by Dundee and Perth. It consists of an old and new Town.
    The old town stands upon the south of the Carron, and is a straggling and irregularly
    built place, adjoining the Harbour ; containing two streets of houses, built on
    ground originally fued by one of the Earls Marischal. The parish church of Dunnottar,
    is built on a picturesque and sequestered spot, about a mile and a half from the
    harbour. The Harbour is a natural Basin, sheltered on the south east, by high
    rocks, and protected from the sea, by a stone pier on each side ; which renders
    it extremely convenient for loading and discharging car-

    safety of the harbour. The new Town, lying on the northern side of the Carron,
    is locally situated in the parish of Fetteresso, on grounds feued by Barclay of
    Urie. It is laid out upon a regular plan, of wide streets and squares, on a level
    peninsula, formed by the waters of Cowie and Carron. The principal streets run
    south and north r and are parallel with the sea-shore, by which they are bounded
    on the east. Allardice Street, and Barclay Street, are filled up with handsome
    slated houses ; and the buildings in the other streets are going on rapidly. In
    the centre of Barclay Square, is a very commodious market-house, surmounted by
    a Toweiv The new church lies at a short distance to the north-west of the town,

    ; and a small chapel, in connexion with the Wesleyan Medothists, was founded in
    the year I827. The County Hall, and Jail, &c. form three sides of a square,, and
    are situated in the old town. There are two Lint SpinningMills, an extensive Brewery,
    and a Rope walk. The Bank of Scotland has a branch established in Stonehaven.
    The trade of Stonehaven is limited ; notwithstanding its fine situation, the manufacture
    of brown Linen, which has been introduced, is the only article which is doing
    well. Some white fish are cured, and a good dpai of oil is made, obtained chiefly

    for trade lias shewn itself, and the commerce of the town is rapidly increasing.
    Within the last ten years, Stonehaven has acquired a busy and -eheerful appearance,
    and is the residence of many respectable families. Stonehaven is a Birgh of Barony,
    the jurisdiction of which, by the charter, is vested in Magistrates, chosen by
    the superior, and feuars. The Sheriff Courts for the County, are held here every
    Wednesday and Friday, and a Justice of Peace Court is held on the first Monday
    of every month, for the recovery of small debts, &c. The turnpike road to Aberdeen,
    passes through the Town, and another road goes directly to Perth, through the
    valley of Strathmore. The ancient Castle of Dunnottar, upon the beach, at a short
    distance from Stonehaven, exhibits one of the most majestic ruins in Scotland.
    It is situated upon a perpendicular rock, rising 150 feet above the level of the
    sea. The top of this rock is a plain of three acres in extent, and is connected
    with the main land, by a narrow and precipitous isthmus. The ruins that remain,
    still occupy one half of the ground ; the whole top of the rock, appears to have
    been covered with buildings. The entrance into the Castle, is flanked by a square
    tower of great strength, and defended in its interior, by several sally-ports,
    which, before the invention of Artillery, must have rendered it impregnable. This
    Castle was the seat of the Marischal family, who were attainted in 1715, and is
    now the property of Sir Alexander Keith, of Ravelston and Dunnottar> the descendent
    and representative of that family. It

    in June, second Thursday in August, and the first Thursday in November. The parish
    of Dunnottar is of a triangular figure, extending about four miles each side.
    It is situated on the coast ; and the Strath, called the How, or Hallow of the
    Mearns begins here, and running through the parish, divides it nearly into two
    equal parts. The surface is generally uneven, but there are no risings which deserve
    the name of hills, except the Grampians, which are the boundary of the parish
    on the west. Towards the coast, the soil is a clay loam, but as it recedes inwards,
    it degenerates into a wet gravelly moor. The coast is bold and rocky, and there
    are many deep caves in the rocks frequented by sea fowl. The new Town of Stonehaven,
    is in the parish of Fetteresso, which bounds Dunnottar, on the north. This parish
    is about ten miles'long, and six broad, of which one third is arable, the rest
    is moor and moss ; the richest part lies between the rivers Carron and Cowie.
    This parish is rapidly improving in agriculture, through the spirited example
    of the patriotic Mr Barclay of Urie. The sea-coast continues to be bold and rocky.

    of Lord Seaforth, the proprietor, and the grant of irredeemable feus for building,
    it has become a place of considerable importance as a Fishing station. It has

    No place in the north of Scotland, and in an insulated situation also, has made
    more rapid strides at improvement, both in a domestic and commercial point of
    view, than Stornaway. The fisheries, especially for white fish, is conducted on
    a large scale. The number of boats fitted out annually for that fishery, amount

    of Shell Fish, and are well adapted for the white and Herring fisheries. The river
    also abounds with Salmon and Trout, The inhabitants of Stornaway and the coast,
    are chiefly employed in the fisheries ; those of the interior, in the rearing
    of Sheep and Black Cattle, which are here, as in the other northern islands^of

  clean_text: 347 The Parish of Stornaway is of great extent, forming an isoceles
    triangle, two of the sides of which measure about ten miles, and the third about
    seven miles long. The general appearance is a flat moor, with a small extent of
    cultivated land ; on the coast, the soil is generally a mixture of moss and sand,
    tolerably fertile. The extent of sea coast is about 35 miles, and the shores are
    partly sandy, but general rocky, presenting many Bays or inlets, the chief of
    which, are Broad Bay, South Bay, Loch Stornaway, and Loch Grimshader ; all these
    Bays afford anchorage for Vessels employed in the fisheries; but Loch Stornaway
    is particularly excellent ; Ships of any burden have sufficient water, good ground,
    and no heavy sea can enter it. On an elevated situation, on the north-west side
    of the Harbour, stands Seaforth Lodge, the occasional residence of Lord Seaforth
    ; around this mansion are small plantations of Birch and Hazel, almost the only
    wood to be seen in the parish ; though from the number of roots of trees, which
    are every where dug up, it would appear, that in former times, the island had
    been covered with wood. There are numerous monuments of antiquity to be found
    here, as Duns, Fortified Castles, Druidical edifices, Cairns, and upright Stones.
    The most remarkble of what is generally denominated druidical circles, is to be
    seen near the village of Cullernish, in the neighbouring parish of Uig. The circle
    consists of twelve stones or obelisks, each about seven feet high, and distant
    from each other about six feet. In the centre is an obelisk of a larger size,
    13 feet above ground. Directly south from the circle, stands three
